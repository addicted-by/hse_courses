Hands-on Graph Neural Networks with PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/hands-on-graph-neural-networks-with-pytorch-pytorch-geometric-359487e221a8,"Kung-Hsiang, Huang (Steeve)",3900,9,1615,"In my last article, I introduced the concept of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and some recent advancements of it. Since this topic is getting seriously hyped up, I decided to make this tutorial on how to easily implement your Graph Neural Network in your project. You will learn how to construct your own GNN with PyTorch Geometric, and how to use GNN to solve a real-world problem (Recsys Challenge 2015).In this blog post, we will be using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric (PyG), a Graph Neural Network framework built on top of PyTorch that runs blazingly fast. It is several times faster than the most well-known GNN framework, DGL.Aside from its remarkable speed, PyG comes with a collection of well-implemented GNN models illustrated in various papers. Therefore, it would be very handy to reproduce the experiments with PyG.Given its advantage in speed and convenience, without a doubt, PyG is one of the most popular and widely used GNN libraries. Let‚Äôs dive into the topic and get our hands dirty!This section will walk you through the basics of PyG. Essentially, it will cover torch_geometric.data and torch_geometric.nn. You will learn how to pass geometric data into your GNN, and how to design a custom MessagePassing layer, the core of GNN.The torch_geometric.data module contains a Data class that allows you to create graphs from your data very easily. You only need to specify:Let‚Äôs use the following graph to demonstrate how to create a Data objectSo there are 4 nodes in the graph, v1 ‚Ä¶ v4, each of which is associated with a 2-dimensional feature vector, and a label y indicating its class. These two can be represented as FloatTensors:The graph connectivity (edge index) should be confined with the COO format, i.e. the first list contains the index of the source nodes, while the index of target nodes is specified in the second list.Note that the order of the edge index is irrelevant to the Data object you create since such information is only for computing the adjacency matrix. Therefore, the above edge_index express the same information as the following one.Putting them together, we can create a Data object as shown below:The dataset creation procedure is not very straightforward, but it may seem familiar to those who‚Äôve used torchvision, as PyG is following its convention. PyG provides two different types of dataset classes, InMemoryDataset and Dataset. As they indicate literally, the former one is for data that fit in your RAM, while the second one is for much larger data. Since their implementations are quite similar, I will only cover InMemoryDataset.To create an InMemoryDataset object, there are 4 functions you need to implement:It returns a list that shows a list of raw, unprocessed file names. If you only have a file then the returned list should only contain 1 element. In fact, you can simply return an empty list and specify your file later in process().Similar to the last function, it also returns a list containing the file names of all the processed data. After process() is called, Usually, the returned list should only have one element, storing the only processed data file name.This function should download the data you are working on to the directory as specified in self.raw_dir. If you don‚Äôt need to download data, simply drop inin the function.This is the most important method of Dataset. You need to gather your data into a list of Data objects. Then, call self.collate() to compute the slices that will be used by the DataLoader object. The following shows an example of the custom dataset from PyG official website.I will show you how I create a custom dataset from the data provided in RecSys Challenge 2015 later in this article.The DataLoader class allows you to feed data by batch into the model effortlessly. To create a DataLoader object, you simply specify the Dataset and the batch size you want.Every iteration of a DataLoader object yields a Batch object, which is very much like a Data object but with an attribute, ‚Äúbatch‚Äù. It indicates which graph each node is associated with. Since a DataLoader aggregates x, y, and edge_index from different samples/ graphs into Batches, the GNN model needs this ‚Äúbatch‚Äù information to know which nodes belong to the same graph within a batch to perform computation.Message passing is the essence of GNN which describes how node embeddings are learned. I have talked about in my last post, so I will just briefly run through this with terms that conform to the PyG documentation.x denotes the node embeddings, e denotes the edge features, ùúô denotes the message function, ‚ñ° denotes the aggregation function, ùõæ denotes the update function. If the edges in the graph have no feature other than connectivity, e is essentially the edge index of the graph. The superscript represents the index of the layer. When k=1, x represents the input feature of each node. Below I will illustrate how each function works:It takes in edge index and other optional information, such as node features (embedding). Calling this function will consequently call message and update.You specify how you construct ‚Äúmessage‚Äù for each of the node pair (x_i, x_j). Since it follows the calls of propagate, it can take any argument passing to propagate. One thing to note is that you can define the mapping from arguments to the specific nodes with ‚Äú_i‚Äù and ‚Äú_j‚Äù. Therefore, you must be very careful when naming the argument of this function.It takes in the aggregated message and other arguments passed into propagate, assigning a new embedding value for each node.ExampleLet‚Äôs see how we can implement a SageConv layer from the paper ‚ÄúInductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs‚Äù. The message passing formula of SageConv is defined as:Here, we use max pooling as the aggregation method. Therefore, the right-hand side of the first line can be written as:which illustrates how the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù is constructed. Each neighboring node embedding is multiplied by a weight matrix, added a bias and passed through an activation function. This can be easily done with torch.nn.Linear.As for the update part, the aggregated message and the current node embedding is aggregated. Then, it is multiplied by another weight matrix and applied another activation function.Putting it together, we have the following SageConv layer.The RecSys Challenge 2015 is challenging data scientists to build a session-based recommender system. Participants in this challenge are asked to solve two tasks:First, we download the data from the official website of RecSys Challenge 2015 and construct a Dataset. We‚Äôll start with the first task as that one is easier.The challenge provides two main sets of data, yoochoose-clicks.dat, and yoochoose-buys.dat, containing click events and buy events, respectively. Let‚Äôs quickly glance through the data:After downloading the data, we preprocess it so that it can be fed to our model. item_ids are categorically encoded to ensure the encoded item_ids, which will later be mapped to an embedding matrix, starts at 0.Since the data is quite large, we subsample it for easier demonstration.To determine the ground truth, i.e. whether there is any buy event for a given session, we simply check if a session_id in yoochoose-clicks.dat presents in yoochoose-buys.dat as well.The data is ready to be transformed into a Dataset object after the preprocessing step. Here, we treat each item in a session as a node, and therefore all items in the same session form a graph. To build the dataset, we group the preprocessed data by session_id and iterate over these groups. In each iteration, the item_id in each group are categorically encoded again since for each graph, the node index should count from 0. Thus, we have the following:After building the dataset, we call shuffle() to make sure it has been randomly shuffled and then split it into three sets for training, validation, and testing.The following custom GNN takes reference from one of the examples in PyG‚Äôs official Github repository. I changed the GraphConv layer with our self-implemented SAGEConv layer illustrated above. In addition, the output layer was also modified to match with a binary classification setup.Training our custom GNN is very easy, we simply iterate the DataLoader constructed from the training set and back-propagate the loss function. Here, we use Adam as the optimizer with the learning rate set to 0.005 and Binary Cross Entropy as the loss function.This label is highly unbalanced with an overwhelming amount of negative labels since most of the sessions are not followed by any buy event. In other words, a dumb model guessing all negatives would give you above 90% accuracy. Therefore, instead of accuracy, Area Under Curve (AUC) is a better metric for this task as it only cares if the positive examples are scored higher than the negative examples. We use the off-the-shelf AUC calculation function from Sklearn.I trained the model for 1 epoch, and measure the training, validation, and testing AUC scores:With only 1 Million rows of training data (around 10% of all data) and 1 epoch of training, we can obtain an AUC score of around 0.73 for validation and test set. The score is very likely to improve if more data is used to train the model with larger training steps.You have learned the basic usage of PyTorch Geometric, including dataset construction, custom graph layer, and training GNNs with real-world data. All the code in this post can also be found in my Github repo, where you can find another Jupyter notebook file in which I solve the second task of the RecSys Challenge 2015.

An Easy Introduction to SQL for Data Scientists,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/an-easy-introduction-to-sql-for-data-scientists-83363ae004b9,George Seif,21000,8,742,"Want to be inspired? Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. üòéSQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardised programming language designed for data storage and management. It allows one to create, parse, and manipulate data fast and easy.With the AI-hype of recent years, technology companies serving all kinds of industries have been forced to become more data driven. When a company that serves thousands of customers is data driven, they‚Äôll need a way to store and frequently access data on the order of millions or even billions of data points.That‚Äôs where SQL comes in.SQL is popular because it‚Äôs both fast and easy to understand. It‚Äôs designed to be read and written in a similar way to the English language. When an SQL query is used to retrieve data, that data is not copied anywhere, but instead accessed directly where it‚Äôs stored making the process much faster than other approaches.This tutorial will teach you the basics of SQL including:Let‚Äôs jump right into it!The first thing we‚Äôll do is actually install our SQL server! That‚Äôll give us a workbench to start playing around with databases and SQL queries.To install a MySQL server, you can run the following command from your terminal:Now we‚Äôll start our MySQL server. This is similar to how we start Python in the terminal by just typing out ‚Äúpython‚Äù. The only difference here is that it‚Äôs convenient to give our server root privileges so we‚Äôll have flexible access to everything.Great! Now our mysql server is running and we can start issuing MySQL commands.A couple of things to keep in mind before we move forward:Now we‚Äôre ready to create our first SQL database.A database is an organised collection of data. In practical terms, you can think of a database as the highest level in the hierarchy.A table stores data in rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). A database can and usually does consist of multiple tablesFor the rest of our tutorial, we‚Äôre going to be using Soccer (or Football if you prefer) players‚Äô stats for the data in our database.The first thing we‚Äôll do is create a database called ‚Äúsoccer_data‚Äù with the ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù command. We can then ‚Äúactivate‚Äù our new database with the ‚ÄúUSE‚Äù command.Just like when we create any table in Excel or Google Sheets, we‚Äôre going to define the names of each column, along with what type of data will be in that column.Our ‚Äústats‚Äù table will track the goals, assists, points, and number of shots for each soccer player:The above command did a few things for us:We can check what tables our database has like so:Going a step further, we can see some information about our newly created table:Now we‚Äôll starting populating our table with soccer stats data!Remember how I mentioned that SQL is very human-readable? Inserting data into our table can be done using a command called INSERT followed by the table name and a simple tuple of the data we would like to insert.A couple of things to keep in mind when inserting data:To display all of the data in your table, simply run:There‚Äôs all our soccer stats.Notice how ‚ÄúSELECT *‚Äù grabs everything from our table. If you only wanted the name and number of goals, you can instead specify which columns you wish to retrieve:To update a row in our table we can use‚Ä¶.. you guessed it, the UPDATE command!In the above query:Now that we‚Äôve populated our table with data, we‚Äôll learn how to actually retrieve it. This will be where the bulk of SQL work will be for those working in Data Science or Machine Learning ‚Äî retrieving data to prepare it for exploration and training.You‚Äôve already done a query in the last section using the SELECT command. This time we‚Äôll run a few more complicated queries.We can limit the number of rows we retrieve:Or order our output by the number of goals a player scored:We can combine our SELECT statement with the WHERE command to create a type of if-else query for retrieving data:MySQL even provides us with the ability to perform calculations. Check out how we can compute the shooting percentage of each player and sort the table by those numbers:That concludes our easy introduction to SQL!If you‚Äôd like to practice using SQL queries, I‚Äôd highly recommend playing around with the HackerRank challenges which already provide pre-built databases and tables for query practice.Follow me on twitter where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!

A Step-by-Step Implementation of Gradient Descent and Backpropagation,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-step-by-step-implementation-of-gradient-descent-and-backpropagation-d58bda486110,Yitong Ren,332,4,534,"The original intention behind this post was merely me brushing upon mathematics in neural network, as I like to be well versed in the inner workings of algorithms and get to the essence of things. I then think I might as well put together a story rather than just revisiting the formulas on my notepad over and over. Though you might find a number of tutorials for building a simple neural network from scratch. Different people have varied angles of seeing things as well as the emphasis of study. Another way of thinking might in some sense enhance understanding. So let‚Äôs dive in.Neural network in a nutshellThe core of neural network is a big function that maps some input to the desired target value, in the intermediate step does the operation to produce the network, which is by multiplying weights and add bias in a pipeline scenario that does this over and over again. The process of training a neural network is to determine a set of parameters that minimize the difference between expected value and model output. This is done using gradient descent (aka backpropagation), which by definition comprises two steps: calculating gradients of the loss/error function, then updating existing parameters in response to the gradients, which is how the descent is done. This cycle is repeated until reaching the minima of the loss function. This learning process can be described by the simple equation: W(t+1) = W(t) ‚Äî dJ(W)/dW(t).The mathematical intuitionFor my own practice purpose, I like to use a small network with a single hidden layer as in the diagram. In this layout, X represents input, subscripts i, j, k denote the number of units in the input, hidden and output layers respectively; w_ij represents the weights connecting input to hidden layer, and w_jk is the weights connecting hidden to output layer.The model output calculation, in this case, would be:Often the choice of the loss function is the sum of squared error. Here I use sigmoid activation function and assume bias b is 0 for simplicity, meaning weights are the only variables that affect model output. Let‚Äôs derive the formula for calculating gradients of hidden to output weights w_jk.The complexity of determining input to hidden weights is that it affects output error indirectly. Each hidden unit output affects model output, thus input to hidden weights w_ij depend on the errors at all of the units it is connected to. The derivation starts the same, just to expand the chain rule at z_k to the subfunction.More thoughts:Notice that the gradients of the two weights have a similar form. The error is backpropagated via the derivative of activation function, then weighted by the input (the activation output) from the previous layer. In the second formula, the backpropagated error from the output layer is further projected onto w_jk, then repeat the same way of backpropagation and weighted by the input. This backpropagating process is iterated all the way back to the very first layer in an arbitrary-layer neural network. ‚ÄúThe gradients with respect to each parameter are thus considered to be the contribution of the parameter to the error and should be negated during learning.‚ÄùPutting the above process into code:Below is the complete example:References:",30/05/2019,4,1,4,5,1050,592,6,1,0,3,474
Introduction to Latent Matrix Factorization Recommender Systems,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-latent-matrix-factorization-recommender-systems-8dfc63b94875,Tumas Rackaitis,37,5,860,"Latent Matrix Factorization is an incredibly powerful method to use when creating a Recommender System. Ever since Latent Matrix Factorization was shown to outperform other recommendation methods in the Netflix Recommendation contest, its been a cornerstone in building Recommender Systems. This article will aim to give you some intuition for when to use Latent Matrix Factorization for Recommendation, while also giving some intuition behind why it works. If you‚Äôd like to see a full implementation, you can go to my Kaggle kernel: Probabilistic Matrix Factorization.Before starting, let‚Äôs first review the problem we‚Äôre trying to solve. Latent Matrix Factorization is an algorithm tackling the Recommendation Problem: Given a set of m users and n items, and set of ratings from user for some items, try to recommend the top items for each user. There are many flavors and alternate deviations of this problem, most of which add more dimensions to the problem, like adding tags. What makes Latent Matrix Factorization powerful is that it yields really strong results from the core problem, and can be a good foundation to build from.When working with an User-Item matrix of ratings, and reading an article on matrix factorization, the first place to look is in linear algebra. That intuition is correct, but its not exactly what you‚Äôd expect.Traditional Linear Algebra is the bedrock of Machine Learning, and that is because most machine learning applications have something Recommender Systems do not: a data-set without NaNs(incomplete data entries). For example, whenever you‚Äôre constructing a model, NaNs, or missing data, are pruned in the data pre-processing step, as most functions cannot work with unfilled values. Functions like Principal Component Analysis are undefined if there are missing values. However, Recommender Systems cannot work if you get rid of NaNs. Those NaNs exist for a reason: not every user has rated every item, and its a bit nonsensical to expect them to. Working with Sparse data is something that can be very different ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what makes Recommendation an interesting problem.Sparsity complicates matters. Singular Value Decomposition, a factorization of a m x n Matrix into its singular and orthogonal values, is undefined if any of the entries in the Matrix are undefined. This means we cannot explicitly factorize the Matrix in such a way where we can find which we can find which diagonal(or latent) factors carry the most weight in the data set.Instead, we‚Äôre going to approximate the best factorization of the Matrix, using a technique called Probabilistic Matrix Factorization. This technique is accredited to Simon Funk who used this technique in his FunkSVD algorithm to get very successful in the Netflix contest. For more reading, check out Simon‚Äôs original post.I‚Äôll explain the algorithm, then explain the intuition.We‚Äôll first initialize two matrices from a Gaussian Distribution(alternatively, randomly initialize them). The first one will be a m x k matrix P while the second will be a k x n matrix Q. When these two matrices multiply with each other, they result in an m x n matrix, which is exactly the size of our Rating matrix in which we are trying to predict. The dimension k is one of our hyper-parameters, which represents the amount of latent factors we‚Äôre using to estimate the ratings matrix. Generally, k is between 10‚Äì250, but don‚Äôt take my word for it ‚Äî use a line search(or grid search) to find the optimal value for your application.With our Matrices P, Q, we‚Äôll optimize their values by using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Therefore, you‚Äôll have two more hyper-parameters to optimize, learning rate and epochs. For each Epoch, we‚Äôre going to iterate through every known rating in our original m x n matrix.Then, we‚Äôll get a error or residual value e by subtracting the original rating value by the dot product of the original ratings‚Äô user‚Äôs row in P and its item‚Äôs column in Q.In normal Stochastic Gradient Descent fashion, we‚Äôll update both of the matrices P and Q simultaneously by adding the current row for P and Q by the learning rate times the product of the error times the other Matrix‚Äôs values.Here it is in python. View it fully in my Kaggle Kernel.Now that we have the algorithm, why does it work and how do we interpret it‚Äôs results?Latent factors represent categories that are present in the data. For k=5 latent factors for a movie data-set, those could represent action, romance, sci-fi, comedy, and horror. With a higher k, you have more specific categories. Whats going is we are trying to predict a user u‚Äôs rating of item i. Therefore, we look at P to find a vector representing user u, and their preferences or ‚Äúaffinity‚Äù toward all of the latent factors. Then, we look at Q to find a vector representing item i and it‚Äôs ‚Äúaffinity‚Äù toward all the latent factors. We get the dot product of these two vectors, which will return us a sense of how much the user likes the item in context of the latent factors.A great deal of information and inspiration came from this paper on Probabilistic Matrix Factorization and from chapter 3 in Recommender Systems: The Textbook by Charu Aggarwal.You can find a python implementation here.",30/05/2019,2,1,11,12,813,470,3,0,0,9,214
Databricks: How to Save Data Frames as CSV Files on Your Local Computer,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/databricks-how-to-save-files-in-csv-on-your-local-computer-3d0c70e6a9ab,Deborah Kewon,129,4,633,"When I work on Python projects dealing with large datasets, I usually use Spyder. The environment of Spyder is very simple; I can browse through working directories, maintain large code bases and review data frames I create. However, if I don‚Äôt subset the large data, I constantly face memory issues and struggle with very long computational time. For this reason, I occasionally use Databricks. Databricks is a Microsoft Azure platform where you can easily parse large amounts of data into ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù and perform Apache Spark-based analytics.If you want to work with data frames and run models using pyspark, you can easily refer to Databricks‚Äô website for more information. However, while working on Databricks, I noticed that saving files in CSV, which is supposed to be quite easy, is not very straightforward. In the following section, I would like to share how you can save data frames from Databricks into CSV format on your local computer with no hassles.From Azure Databricks home, you can go to ‚ÄúUpload Data‚Äù (under Common Tasks)‚Üí ‚ÄúDBFS‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFileStore‚Äù.DBFS FileStore is where you create folders and save your data frames into CSV format. By default, FileStore has three folders: import-stage, plots, and tables.Using the above code on the notebook, I created a folder ‚Äúdf‚Äù and saved a data frame ‚ÄúSample‚Äù into CSV. It is important to use coalesce(1) since it saves the data frame as a whole. At the end of this article, I will also demonstrate what happens when you don‚Äôt include coalesce(1) in the code.Once you convert your data frame into CSV, go to your FileStore. You will see the folder and files you create. The ‚Äúpart-00000‚Äù is the CSV file I had to download on my local computer. I copied the path after /FileStore/ for step 3.In order to download the CSV file located in DBFS FileStore on your local computer, you will have to change the highlighted URL to the following:https://westeurope.azuredatabricks.net/files/df/Sample.csv/part-00000-tid-8365188928461432060‚Äì63d7293d-3b02‚Äì43ff-b461-edd732f9e06e-4704-c000.csv?o=3847738880082577As you noticed, the CSV path in bold (df/Sample.csv/part-00000-tid-8365188928461432060‚Äì63d7293d-3b02‚Äì43ff-b461-edd732f9e06e-4704-c000.csv) is from step 2. The number (3847738880082577) is from the original URL.When you change the URL as described above and press enter, the CSV file will be automatically downloaded on your local computer.If you want to delete files in the FileStore, you can simply use the above code. Once it is deleted, you will get the comment ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù.As promised earlier, here are the details when you don‚Äôt include coalesce(1) in the code.By default, Databricks saves data into many partitions. Coalesce(1) combines all the files into one and solves this partitioning problem. However, it is not a good idea to use coalesce (1) or repartition (1) when you deal with very big datasets (>1TB, low velocity) because it transfers all the data to a single worker, which causes out of memory issues and slow processing. In this case, parsing by column or distributing to more than one single worker is recommended.On a side note, there are also two other methods to save data frames as CSV files on your local computer:This method is the easiest. However, Databricks downloads only up to 1 million rows. Therefore, if you have a data frame that is more than 1 million rows, I recommend you to use the above method or Databricks CLI as below.2. Using Databricks CLIDatabricks CLI (Databricks command-line interface), which is built on top of the Databricks REST API, interacts with Databricks workspaces and filesystem APIs. Databricks CLI needs some set-ups, but you can also use this method to download your data frames on your local computer. For more details, refer to the Databricks CLI webpage.Thank you for reading!

How to Use ggplot2 in Python,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-ggplot2-in-python-74ab8adec129,Lukas Frei,1700,5,911,"Thanks to its strict implementation of the grammar of graphics, ggplot2 provides an extremely intuitive and consistent way of plotting your data. Not only does ggplot2‚Äôs approach to plotting ensure that each plot comprises certain basic elements but it also simplifies the readability of your code to a great extent.However, if you are a frequent user of Python, then implementing the grammar of graphics can be extremely challenging due to the lack of standardized syntax in popular plotting libraries, such as matplotlib or seaborn. Should you still want to make use of the grammar of graphics, then the Python package plotnine provides an alternative for you.In case you should be unfamiliar with the grammar of graphics, here is a quick overview:As you can see, there are several components that make up the grammar of graphics, starting with your data. After identifying the data you would like to visualize, you have to specify the variables you are interested in. For instance, you might want to display one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis. Third, you have to define what type of geometric object (geom for short) you would like to utilize. This could be anything from a bar plot to a scatter plot or any of the other existing plot types.These first three components are compulsory. Without data, there is nothing to plot. Without axis definitions, there is nothing to plot either. And finally, without defining a geometric object, you will only see an empty coordinate system. The remaining components making up the grammar of graphics are optional and can be implemented to improve visualizations. Facets refer to specifications of subplots, that is, plotting several variables within your data next to one another in separate plots. Statistical transformations mainly refer to the inclusion of summary statistics in your plot, such as the median or percentiles. Coordinates describe the different coordinate systems available to you. The most used and default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. Depending on the structure of the data you would like to plot, lesser used coordinate systems, such as the Polar coordinate system, might provide a better way of visualizing your data. Finally, themes provide a variety of options to design all non-data elements of your plot, such as the legend, background, or annotations.While there are many ways of visualizing the grammar of graphics, I particularly like the one I created above because it implies the additivity of these layers as well as the fact that they are building upon one another. If you have ever used ggplot2, you are familiar with the ‚Äò+‚Äô in its syntax that symbolizes the same idea described above.plotnine is a Python package allowing you to use ggplot2-like code that is implementing the grammar of graphics. By doing so, just as in ggplot2, you are able to specifically map data to visual objects that make up the visualization. This enables you to improve both the readability as well as the structure of your code. While you could set matplotlib‚Äôs style to ggplot, you cannot implement the grammar of graphics in matplotlib the same way you can in ggplot2.Before getting started, you have to install plotnine. As always, there are two main options for doing so: pip and conda.Having installed plotnine, you can get started plotting using the grammar of graphics. Let us begin by building a very simple plot only using the three requisite components: data, aesthetics, and geometric objects.As you can see, the syntax is very similar to ggplot2. First, we specify the data source. In our case, the data we are using is the classic mpg data set. Next, we define that the variable ‚Äòclass‚Äô is going to be displayed on the x-axis. Lastly, we say that we would like to use a bar plot with bars of size 20 to visualize our data. Let us look at the complete code and the resulting plot:The code above will yield the following output:While this is a good start, it is not very nice to look at yet. Let us use other components of the grammar of graphics to beautify our plot.For instance, we could flip the axes using coord_flip() and customize the plot and axes titles with labs() to improve our plot. Using the code chunk above, our plot would look like this:Besides basic plots, you can do almost everything you could otherwise do in ggplot2, such as plotting multidimensional data. If you would like to visualize the relationships between three variables you could add aesthetics to an otherwise two-dimensional plot:Adding color to the aesthetics will prompt plotnine to display a two-dimensional plot using displ (engine displacement, in liters) on its x- and hwy (highway miles per gallon) on its y-axis and color the data according to the variable class. We have also switched the geometric object to geom_point(), which will give us a scatter instead of a bar plot. Let us take a look at what that would look like:As you can see, plotnine provides you with the ability to utilize the grammar of graphics within Python.

A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Word Embedding with Gensim Word2Vec Model,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-word-embedding-with-gensim-word2vec-model-5970fa56cc92,Zhi Li,147,8,1045,"Word embedding is one of the most important techniques in natural language processing(NLP), where words are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Word embedding is capable of capturing the meaning of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words. It also has been widely used for recommender systems and text classification. This tutorial will show a brief introduction of genism word2vec model with an example of generating word embedding for the vehicle make model.Word2vec is one of the most popular technique to learn word embeddings using a two-layer neural network. Its input is a text corpus and its output is a set of vectors. Word embedding via word2vec can make natural language computer-readable, then further implementation of mathematical operations on words can be used to detect their similarities. A well-trained set of word vectors will place similar words close to each other in that space. For instance, the words women, men, and human might cluster in one corner, while yellow, red and blue cluster together in another.There are two main training algorithms for word2vec, one is the continuous bag of words(CBOW), another is called skip-gram. The major difference between these two methods is that CBOW is using context to predict a target word while skip-gram is using a word to predict a target context. Generally, the skip-gram method can have a better performance compared with CBOW method, for it can capture two semantics for a single word. For instance, it will have two vector representations for Apple, one for the company and another for the fruit. For more details about the word2vec algorithm, please check here.Gensim is an open source python library for natural language processing and it was developed and is maintained by the Czech natural language processing researcher Radim ≈òeh≈Ø≈ôek. Gensim library will enable us to develop word embeddings by training our own word2vec models on a custom corpus either with CBOW of skip-grams algorithms.At first, we need to install the genism package. Gensim runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, and should run on any other platform that supports Python 2.7+ and NumPy. Gensim depends on the following software:There are two ways for installation. We could run the following code in our terminal to install genism package.Or, alternatively for Conda environments:In this tutorial, I will show how to generate word embedding with genism using a concrete example. The dataset I used for this tutorial is from Kaggle Dataset.This vehicle dataset includes features such as make, model, year, engine, and other properties of the car. We will use these features to generate the word embeddings for each make model and then compare the similarities between different make model. The full python tutorial can be found here.Since the purpose of this tutorial is to learn how to generate word embeddings using genism library, we will not do the EDA and feature selection for the word2vec model for the sake of simplicity.Genism word2vec requires that a format of ‚Äòlist of lists‚Äô for training where every document is contained in a list and every list contains lists of tokens of that document. At first, we need to generate a format of ‚Äòlist of lists‚Äô for training the make model word embedding. To be more specific, each make model is contained in a list and every list contains lists of features of that make model.To achieve this, we need to do the following things :a. Create a new column for Make Modelb. Generate a format of ‚Äò list of lists‚Äô for each Make Model with the following features: Engine Fuel Type, Transmission Type, Driven_Wheels, Market Category, Vehicle Size, Vehicle Style.We can train the genism word2vec model with our own custom corpus as following:Let‚Äôs try to understand the hyperparameters of this model.size: The number of dimensions of the embeddings and the default is 100.window: The maximum distance between a target word and words around the target word. The default window is 5.min_count: The minimum count of words to consider when training the model; words with occurrence less than this count will be ignored. The default for min_count is 5.workers: The number of partitions during training and the default workers is 3.sg: The training algorithm, either CBOW(0) or skip gram(1). The default training algorithm is CBOW.After training the word2vec model, we can obtain the word embedding directly from the training model as following.Now we could even use Word2vec to compute the similarity between two Make Models in the vocabulary by invoking the model.similarity( ) and passing in the relevant words. For instance, model.similarity(‚ÄòPorsche 718 Cayman‚Äô, ‚ÄòNissan Van‚Äô) This will give us the Euclidian similarity between Porsche 718 Cayman and Nissan Van.From the above examples, we can tell that Porsche 718 Cayman is more similar to Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class than Nissan Van. We also can use the built-in function model.most_similar() to get a set of the most similar make models for a given make model based on the Euclidean distance.However, Euclidian similarity cannot work well for the high-dimensional word vectors. This is because Euclidian similarity will increase as the number of dimensions increases, even if the word embedding stands for different meanings. Alternatively, we can use cosine similarity to measure the similarity between two vectors. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity captures the angle of the word vectors and not the magnitude. Under cosine similarity, no similarity is expressed as a 90-degree angle while the total similarity of 1 is at a 0-degree angle.The following function shows how can we generate the most similar make model based on cosine similarity.It‚Äôs hard to visualize the word embedding directly, for they usually have more than 3 dimensions. T-SNE is a useful tool to visualize high-dimensional data by dimension reduction while keeping relative pairwise distance between points. It can be said that T-SNE looking for a new data representation where the neighborhood relations are preserved. The following code shows how to plot the word embedding with T-SNE plot.This T-SNE plot shows the top 10 similar vehicles to the Porsche 718 Cayman in two-dimensional space.I am a master student in Data Science at the University of San Francisco.

Hypothesis testing visualized,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/hypothesis-testing-visualized-6f30b18fc78f,Rohit Pandey,385,12,2288,"In this article, we‚Äôll get an intuitive, visual feel for hypothesis testing. While there are many articles online that explain it in words, there aren‚Äôt nearly enough that rely primarily on visuals; which is surprising since the subject lends itself quite well to exposition through pictures and movies.But before getting too far ahead of ourselves, let‚Äôs briefly describe what it even is.Best to start with an example of a hypothesis test before describing it generally. The first thing we need is a hypothesis. For example, we could hypothesize that the average height of men is greater than the average height of women. In the spirit of ‚Äòproof by contradiction‚Äô, we first assume that there is no difference between the average heights of the two genders. This becomes our default, or null hypothesis. If we collect data on the heights of the two groups and find that it is extremely unlikely to have observed this data if the null hypotheses were true (for example, ‚Äúif the null is true, why do I see such a big difference between the average male and female heights in my samples?‚Äù), we can reject it and conclude there is indeed a difference.For a general hypothesis testing problem, we need the following:We can then proceed to collect data for the two groups, estimate the metric of interest for them and see how compatible our data is with our null and alternate hypothesis. The last part is where the theory of hypothesis testing comes in. We‚Äôll literally see how it works in the proceeding sections.Now that we‚Äôve formed our hypothesis and collected our data, how do we use it to reject our null? The general framework is as follows:It is important to stress that the distribution of concern is the distribution of our estimate in the test statistic and not the distribution of the metric in the population. For instance, in our example of comparing the mean heights of males and females, there will be some variance in the heights of males. However, this is not the variance we‚Äôre interested in. If we take n males and average their heights, we get an estimate of the average height of the male population. There is a variance in this estimate unless we round up every last male member on the planet, measure their heights and average them. If we conducted the experiment again, we will probably get a different set of males with different heights. So, the average we get will be slightly different this time. This variance across repeat experiments (if we conducted them multiple times) is what we‚Äôre interested in estimating.As we increase our sample size for the any of the groups, the variance in our estimate for that group goes down. If you happen to be allergic or just not in the mood for Math and just want to jump to the pictures, you can skip the following section and skip to the next one, I won‚Äôt feel bad :)The variance of our test statistic (example, difference in estimates of average male and female heights) depends on the variance in estimates of the metrics for the two groups. To make this concrete, let‚Äôs say we sampled n1 males and calculated the variance in their heights, s1¬≤. The variance in the estimator of the average male height becomes: s1¬≤/n1. This is because the estimated average male height is:And so the variance in this estimate (how much the estimate, h_m would vary if we sampled n_1 males multiple times) becomes:In equation (2) the best estimate of V(h_i), which is the variance of a single sample is s_1¬≤, the variance calculated from our sample. You can see that as we collect more samples, the variance in this estimator goes down.Similarly, the estimate of the variance in female heights is: s_2¬≤/n2, if n_2 females are sampled.If we choose the difference in means to be our test statistic, it can be expressed as:And the variance in this statistic becomes (since there is no correlation between samples from the two groups):To make it small, both n_1 and n_2 must be made large. Here, we took the example of the difference in means. However, the general conclusion will hold for other test statistics we might have constructed (like ratio of means) as well.All right, I promised pictures and yet all you‚Äôve seen so far are words and symbols. Let‚Äôs visualize what hypothesis testing looks like. Figure 0 below shows the probability density function of t (the test statistic which is the difference in means).Let‚Äôs say we choose a false positive rate (FPR), Œ± of 15% (we don‚Äôt want more than a 15% chance that we incorrectly conclude there is a difference when there is none).The pink vertical line is the point at which the area to the right becomes 15%. So this becomes our threshold for rejecting the null. If the observed statistic is greater than the pink line, we reject the null (conclude there is a significant difference between the heights) and if its less, we don‚Äôt reject it (data couldn‚Äôt conclude there is a substantial difference in heights).Note that for our criterion to reject the null hypothesis, we construct the threshold not on the test statistic itself, but on a probability calculated from its distribution under the null. Why do it in this convoluted way? Because it ensures our test will be able to catch the tiniest of differences between the metrics of the two groups, given enough data, as the variance in the estimate of the statistic will go to zero.Let‚Äôs say the heights of males are always 5 cm more than those of the females. The green point in figure 1 above represents this 5 cm difference. However, since it lies to the left of the pink threshold, we fail to recognize it and conclude that no difference could be found.Let‚Äôs see what happens as we start increasing the amount of data in one of the groups (let‚Äôs say males ‚Äî the groups are labeled as treatment and control in the figure; let‚Äôs say treatment means males and control means females). Per equation (3), the variance of the test statistic starts to go down. And as a result, the pink line (where the area to the right is 15%) starts to move leftward towards the green point. Also per figure 1, we can see that increasing the sample size for the male group can reduce the variance only so much before the contribution from the other group starts to dominate. So, the pink line couldn‚Äôt quite reach the green point.However, as we increase the sample size for the second group (women) as well, the variance starts substantially reducing again and the pink line which is our threshold moves leftward once more until it finally reaches the green point. And with that much data, we will be able to capture differences in average heights as small as the green point from the blue line. The moral of this story is that even the smallest effect size can be caught given enough data (in both groups).Now, we just showed that if we have a tolerance of 15% for the false positive rate, we get the pink line in figures 1 and 2 above. But this is set by us. If false positive rate is the only thing we care about, why not set it as low as possible (0)? This would involve moving the pink line to infinity and we wouldn‚Äôt ever reject the null. There would be no false positives since there would be no positives at all. The obvious downside to this test is when the alternate hypothesis is in fact true (there is a difference between the heights). Now, since we never reject the null, we would incorrectly always fail to reject it even when a difference exists. This would make our false negative rate (probability test returns negative for significant difference even if there is one) the worst possible at 100%. In statistics lingo, the false positive rate is called the type-1 error and is denoted by Œ± while the false negative rate is called the type-2 error and is denoted by Œ≤. Now, Œ± comes from the null hypothesis where we know the mean value of the test statistic (for the test of equal means we‚Äôve been working with, the mean value of the difference of means is zero). To get Œ≤, we assume the alternate hypothesis is true (there is indeed a difference in the heights). So, we need to get the distribution of our statistic under it. The variance and other aspects of this alternate hypothesis should be the same as the null. But, what should we set the mean to? For the null, it was zero (for difference of means test statistic). For the alternate, we just wave our hands and pull a number out of a hat. It‚Äôs called the ‚Äúeffect size‚Äù we want our test to care about. Basically, we assume that the difference in means is exactly 5 cm (say) and see how good our test is at catching this difference (rejecting the null).In the two graphs are shown in the figure 3 below, the yellow curve is the null hypothesis and the purple one is the alternate hypothesis. The gap in their peaks is the effect size. Figure 3 shows clearly the trade-off between Œ± (denoted by the yellow area) and Œ≤ (denoted by purple area). As we reduce Œ±, we move the pink threshold to the right. But this results in increasing the purple area, Œ≤. Also note that when Œ±=0, we always predict negative. So, the false negative rate when the alternate hypothesis is true becomes Œ≤=1. Similarly, when Œ±=1, we‚Äôll have Œ≤=0. And since there is a clear trade-off between them, we‚Äôll get a decreasing function that connects these two extremes. This kind of Œ±-Œ≤ trade-off graph is shown in the bottom-left of figure 3 below. We move along the decreasing function as the pink threshold moves back-and-forth.Now we know that the false positive rate, Œ± is up to us to set but there is a trade-off between it and the false negative rate, Œ≤. For a given sample size (in both groups), any test based on some statistic we construct will have Œ±-Œ≤ profile like the one shown in the bottom left of figure 3. We want both Œ± and Œ≤ to be low, so if a given hypothesis test‚Äôs curve stays below that of another, we will prefer it. In statistics lingo, the preferable test is called a ‚Äúmore powerful test‚Äù because 1-Œ≤ is called the power of a test. Now that we have a way to call a test ‚Äúmore powerful‚Äù, a natural quest for the ‚Äúmost powerful‚Äù test is born, given our metric of interest and the distributions of this metric in the treatment and control groups. This is the concept of a uniformly most powerful test and there is considerable effort in statistics to find these tests. We however, will go in the opposite direction in this section, searching for the worst possible, least powerful test. For if we know what the worst possible deal is, we will never get duped in the worst possible way.Imagine Tom was tasked with determining weather or not there is a statistically significant difference between the heights of males and females. Instead of going out and collecting some data from some males and females, he stays at home and simply tosses a coin. The coin has a probability Œ± of coming up ‚Äúheads‚Äù. If he does get ‚Äúheads‚Äù, he simply concludes that the null hypothesis is true and there is no difference in average heights (in statistics lingo, he ‚Äúfails to reject the null‚Äù). If he gets tails (probability 1-Œ±), he concludes that the alternate hypothesis is true. Given that the null hypothesis is true, he will have a probability Œ± of incorrectly rejecting it (by definition). And if the alternate is true, he will have a probability Œ≤=1-Œ± of not rejecting the null. So the relationship between Œ± and Œ≤ in this case will simply be Œ≤=1-Œ±. This is shown in the red line of figure 4 below. For a more reasonable test that actually collects some sample data and constructs a sensible test statistic (like difference or ratio of means), the corresponding relationship might look something like the white curve below it.Another question of importance in hypothesis testing involves how much sample size we need for our experiment. To answer this, we need the target false positive rate (Œ±), false negative rate (Œ≤) and effect size we‚Äôre interested in measuring. Let‚Äôs say we wanted a 16% false positive rate and 10% false negative rate. This is represented by the green point in the graph on the bottom left of figure 5 below. You can see that initially, the Œ±-Œ≤ curve isn‚Äôt touching the green point (for the target Œ±, the Œ≤ is much higher than what we desire). However, as we start increasing the sample sizes of the control and treatment groups, the entire curve starts shifting downwards until eventually, the green point lies on it (notice that the yellow area, which is Œ± remains constant but the purple area, Œ≤ reduces significantly). This is due to the pink line moving to the left and also the purple curve getting thinner. And this is essentially how we can tell in advance the sample sizes we‚Äôll need for our two groups given the false positive and false negative rates, as well as the effect size we wish to capture.That covers most of the essential aspects of hypothesis testing. Let me know what you think, what I missed and if there are any other aspects of hypothesis testing conducive to such visualizations.",30/05/2019,1,0,2,7,354,263,11,2,0,5,276
Making a DotA2 Bot Using ML,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/making-a-dota2-bot-using-ml-c8cb2423a2be,Musashi Schroeder,7,18,4294,"In December of 2018, the creators of AI Sports gave a presentation and introduced the DotA2 AI Competition to the school. DotA (Defense of the Ancients) is a game played by two teams, each consisting of five players who can choose from over one hundred different heroes. The goal of the game is to destroy the opponents base, while defending your own. Each hero has access to at least four unique abilities, and are able to purchase items that also have different abilities. Items are purchased with gold earned from destroying opponent structures, or defeating players or creeps, NPC (non-player character) units that spawn to help defend and attack bases.The complexity of the game comes from not only the roster of characters, but the ever changing state of the map. Full information games such as chess or go leave no information withheld from players, allowing them to see every possible action on the board at any given time. The DotA map includes a ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù which hides any part of the map not seen by a player or their teammates. Each hero‚Äôs abilities also have ‚Äúcooldowns‚Äù ‚Äî after a player uses an ability, they cannot use it again for a set amount of time ‚Äî and use mana as a resource. While a player has access to this information about their allies, they do not have this information about the opponent, and must take it into consideration when engaging in fights.The rules for the competition were to program a full team of five bots to play in Captain‚Äôs Mode. Captain‚Äôs Mode sets one member of each team as a captain, giving them the ability to choose the heroes for the rest of the team, and also ‚Äúbanning‚Äù, or selecting heroes that the opponent‚Äôs team cannot use. In order to avoid having all of our characters banned, we needed to program at least sixteen of them. Our limitation set by Maurice,42 Silicon Valley staff, was that we could not use the built in ‚Äúdesires,‚Äù a system to provide default behaviors for the bot to execute, provided by Valve. Instead of using the default bot behaviors, we were tasked with writing the code from the bottom up. The API for DotA2 is written in Lua and allows players to create their own bots. The competition was originally designed to use a C++ API written bythe AI Sports creators, but due to ‚Äúcomplications,‚Äù our team used Lua instead.In order to create the bot, we first read through the API and looked for other examples that users had created. The DotA API was made available in early 2016, though hasn‚Äôt received any meaningful updates since approximately October of 2017. The first resource we used was a guide on getting started, written by RuoyuSon. RuoyuSon explained where to find other resources and how to start games, as well as useful console commands for the testing process. Valve also provides small examples of bot scripts in the games directory that can be used to potentially get started. With the API and other examples, we naively believed we could create a bot and have a crude, working version of the code within a week.The first challenge came in selecting the heroes we wanted to use and starting the game. What we didn‚Äôt know at the time was that if the code for hero selection has an error, the entire game will crash without displaying anything. The example provided by Valve can be used to quickly create hero selection code for All Pick Mode, but is unusable for Captain‚Äôs Mode. In order to select heroes, we read through other examples of the code. Although our current iteration of the bot allows for human players to play against and alongside it, the original version was only meant to play against another bot in Captain‚Äôs Mode. Finally getting a simple version of the hero selection working took a little over one week, but since then has been modified to support All Pick Mode and human players.After getting the game to start, we began experimenting with making heroes walk to locations on the map. We quickly learned not knowing the Lua language made writing and understanding other examples of code difficult. While we were able to make bots walk to certain locations or purchase items, we frequently made syntax errors and finding bugs in code took considerable time. After a frustrating two weeks, we took time to learn the language before engaging with the API again.While the tournament drew near, we were still figuring out Lua and fighting to understand the API. Our heroes moved to the correct locations and they were able to fight enemy minions and opponents, albeit poorly, but they would never retreat, resulting in death after death. Even against the easiest default bot difficulty, Passive, we were unable to win. We implemented a crude retreat function ‚Äî simply telling the bots to run back to their base if they took too much damage ‚Äî that helped, but left a lot to be desired. We were able to consistently win against the Passive bot, but usually ended the game with close to 100 deaths per game on our side, and we were lucky to see two deaths on the opponents.The next step, now that the groundwork had been laid for bot behaviors, was to begin to individualize each bot so that they could use their abilities. Each bot uses their skills based on conditions, allowing them to fight the enemy. At this point our lack of DotA experience began to show ‚Äî although the bots were able to use skills, they didn‚Äôt use them optimally simply because we didn‚Äôt know what optimal was. We frequently asked people with more experience for tips and slowly made the bot stronger. Finally, we were able to defeat the Passive bot with a positive score. We attempted to beat the Easy difficulty, but struggled. The difference between the two was significant and we needed to implement more behaviors in order to win.Up to this point, all code had been written as predefined actions for each bot to execute. The complexity of DotA gradually made it more and more difficult to separate what actions to take and when. Should we fight in this instance, or run away? When should we focus on hitting creeps? While we were able to defeat the Passive difficulty consistently, we realized that Easy would be a significant hurdle. We began to discuss possible options, and landed on the State Machine.When modifying bot behaviors, it became impossible to cleanly separate when it would perform actions. They were so closely intertwined that adjusting one would affect the performance of the other, and none of the behaviors worked particularly well. We were also unable to include more behaviors neatly without disrupting other parts of the code. By creating the State Machine, we were able to separate each behavior, using weighted averages to decide which would be the most optimal in any instance of the game. The code for each bot is run every frame, allowing for constant calculations and giving each behavior a value as a weight. Assuming we programmed the bot well, it could now decide for itself what it should do based on the game state.At this point we were able to separate each behavior into its own distinct code, broken down into components and conditions. Components are pieces of information that are always necessary to calculate a behavior, while conditions would add or subtract from the weight only under specific circumstances. Separating the code allowed us to make each behavior perform better ‚Äî previously, each behavior was reliant on another, but by using the State Machine, we would only execute the parts of the code we needed to and only when we needed to.While some of us set up the State Machine, we also continued to improve the non-State Machine version, to the point that we were able to defeat the Easy difficulty. We were once again seeing 100 deaths on the scoreboard, but would get more kills on our side and eke out wins. The code from the non-State Machine version easily slotted into our new bot, allowing us to continue working without any significant delays.One of the benefits of the State Machine was the modularity of the system. Prior to this, the bot‚Äôs generic behaviors were made up of two files that had necessary comments written throughout in order to understand which part of the code was being looked at ‚Äî the new version had separate files for each weight and the behaviors were separated so they did not interact with one another. The modularity allowed multiple people to work on different parts of the project without affecting what someone else might be working on, improving clarity, simplicity, and the team‚Äôs workflow.We were also preparing for our first bot vs bot match against another team in the competition, but the State Machine was untested and not ready to implement. This gave us one last chance to see how the previous version held up. Before we started our scrimmage, we decided to test and make sure both teams‚Äô code ran properly. When both bots had a random mix of the opponent‚Äôs heroes and their own, the teams realized we had made an error in the picking phase. Both teams were able to fix the issue, but it was another instance of fighting with the API, something that would persist throughout the entire process. At this time, we were also notified by Maurice that the tournament would postponed for a month, giving us a chance to continue to improve our bots.During testing against Valve‚Äôs proprietary bots, we would frequently have to restart games because of the compatibility issues with their bot and Captain‚Äôs Mode. We decided to make our own picking mode for two teams in order to speed up the process, and cut down on the unnecessary restarts. We gave our opponent‚Äôs bots a random team of five and used this team for much of our testing. What we didn‚Äôt know at the time was that this would come back to bite us later.Our team continued to work with the State Machine, adding more behaviors that we were unable to implement before. As the behaviors increased, we also started to see improvements in our matches against Valve‚Äôs bot. After defeating Easy, within 24 hours we were able to beat Medium, and the next day we beat Hard and Unfair back to back. We were ecstatic, not expecting to beat Unfair much later down the line, but as we decided to watch the opponent‚Äôs bots closer, our jaws dropped. Two of our opponent‚Äôs bots didn‚Äôt buy items, and one didn‚Äôt use any abilities. Although we were able to win, still a feat in and of itself, it wasn‚Äôt a real victory against the Unfair bot.What we didn‚Äôt know was that Valve only implemented specific skill usage and item purchasing on 46 of the bots. We changed the opponent‚Äôs lineup to five of those bots, and while we could put up a good fight against Hard and win about forty percent of the time, we rarely won against Unfair. We began to have more discussions about what we could do to increase our win rate, resulting in our first roster change. After looking at the heroes we had implemented, at the time only five, we decided to switch out heroes that would hopefully fit our overall game plan better. Immediately we saw an increase and, while we had become attached to the heroes we chose to use, we began to consider swapping heroes as an option as we continued to program.We continued to implement more behaviors into the State Machine, and added more features and, as we did, saw a slow but steady increase in performance in our matches. In order to see how well we did when including something new, we had to watch a full game to observe the specific behavior and to see whether or not we won the match. All of the bot‚Äôs weights were hand-tuned, and any tweaks we made might not be visible within a single game. Even sped up, a game would take between ten and fifteen minutes. In order to gather any meaningful data, we could spend over hours just watching. To speed up this process and make sure that any change we added was meaningful, using Python, the Go programming language , and Docker, we began to create a way of gathering data over hundreds of games.Maurice gave us access to fifteen computers which we could use to run games on and gather data. At this point, we had researched a ‚Äúheadless‚Äù mode for DotA; we were able to run games graphicless which would speed up the games themselves, and allow us to run multiple instances of the game without using the GPU. Using Docker, we set up a client to server connection that allowed us to use virtual machines on fourteen of those computers. We calculated that we could run up to four games per computer optimally, so ran four virtual machines at six times speed. Altogether, we were able to run games approximately 300 times faster than with originally.Each game could range between fifteen and eighty minutes. Docker Swarm distributed the total number of games requested evenly to all of our worker computers. If we were running less than 56 games this solution would be fine, but anything more would be suboptimal. We initially attempted to deploy using Docker Swarm, but it made more sense for us to create our own solution. It would need to be customizable, work well on a distributed network, and have support for simple concurrency. We decided to use Go because it filled our criteria and was easy to build and deploy. Finally, Python was used to graph and illustrate our data results as histograms and line graphs.Using this setup, we were able to run 500 games over an hour, giving us meaningful data. While it was still necessary for us to watch games to observe and confirm behaviors worked properly, we could now test them and gather data in order to confirm whether or not a change was beneficial or detrimental to the bot.As we went into the final weeks, we played with the idea of incorporating a genetic algorithm. The State Machine weights were all hand tuned and based on our observations. Specifically our Farm, Hunt, and Retreat weight were so closely tied together that by changing the values of one, we would see dramatic differences in the way they played and their win rates would generally decrease. We knew they were at a good point, but were sure they weren‚Äôt optimal, especially considering different characters played differently and using the same weights made them all play more or less the same. Using a genetic algorithm would use machine learning to tune each weight, giving us the most ideal numbers to defeat the default bots, and hopefully our opponents in the tournament. An ambitious goal was to create different genes for each character, thereby giving them each their own unique play style, but we knew that without more time or more computing power, we would have to make do with the hand-tuned weights we had.A week before the competition, we strayed away from adding major features, only including small changes that our data decisively proved would increase the win rate. By the end, with the State Machine we were able to achieve a consistent win rate above 98% against the Valve bots. Ready for the competition, Maurice messaged us, informing us that once again the competition had been extended for another month.With the month long extension to the tournament, we began to discuss how we could create a genetic algorithm. In the end, we decided to use Go once again because our data gathering programs had already been written in it, therefore making it easier to tie the programs together.In order to get the genetic algorithm to work, we needed to run multiple iterations of our bot. From those iterations, we would grab the top five heroes genes and ‚Äúbreed‚Äù them by shuffling, averaging, and splicing them together. The next generation would be made up of slightly modified versions (using a 10% mutation probability to choose which genes to change, and 10% mutation rate to change each gene by the respective amount) which we would then gather data on, repeating the process until the beginning of the competition. Our plan was to replace the current hand-tuned genes with our new machine learned ones.Our first step was making sure we could run the genetic algorithm using Go and Docker, and modify the Lua script at the same time. Each bot‚Äôs gene was a Lua file containing the values we wanted to mutate using the genetic algorithm. We used Go to read in the gene file, mutated the values, and output the new gene using a gene template. The new genes were then used for the subsequent iterations.Having successfully created a way to read and write to our new gene files, instead of making one generic genetic algorithm as we had originally planned, we created genes for each hero we were using. In order to make it work, each file had to include the name of the hero we were writing to. Unfortunately we could only train five heroes at a time, so we opted to train our starting lineup and use our hand tuned genes for the rest of the heroes we had implemented.Finishing the genetic algorithm ended up taking longer than planned. We hoped to have it running and training within a week, but needed a few more days to iron out bugs. We had each made separate parts of the genetic algorithm, and piecing each together took some time.Finally, the genetic algorithm worked, but as we began to run the first generations, we ran into multiple issues. At this point, we had continued to have some issues with our Docker containers not running games, but had chosen to ignore it for the time being because while it had been slower in collecting data, it wasn‚Äôt a significant time difference. If one computer malfunctioned and dropped off the network the server would hang, waiting for data to come in from the downed machine. When we decided to use the genetic algorithm, we needed it to run non-stop and continue working through each generation. If a worker failed to respond, the server could never move onto the next generation because it was waiting for the remaining games to come in. It made little sense for us to monitor the computers in shifts all day, so we added in a way of timing out if we did not get a response from the container after a period of time.In the end, after about four days of starting and stopping the genetic algorithm, we finally had it working. While running the genetic algorithm and confirming that it worked, we decided to change our team lineup in favor of one we thought could raise our win rate. When we began running the genetic algorithm and set up the genes we wanted to manipulate, as a team, we went through them and adjusted them to numbers we believed made sense for the genetic algorithm to start on. At that time, we decided to manipulate approximately 25 components and conditions, the ‚Äúgenes,‚Äù from our Farm, Hunt, and Retreat weights. This change combined with a new hero selection we used for the opposing team dropped our win rate from 98% to 80%. While the genetic algorithm was slowly raising the win rate, we spoke as a team and decided that if we could boost it by switching or adding heroes early on, it could be worth testing. After the switch, the initial 80% rose closer to 90%.While we observed the bot, we knew that time was beginning to run out and it wasn‚Äôt growing fast enough. Although it was a risky decision that could result in a potentially drastic decrease in win rate, we decided to adjust the rate of change from 10% mutation probability and 10% mutation rate to 15% and 25% respectively. We calculated that in the most ideal situation, in order to get rid of a gene that was not useful, it would take at least thirty generations, or at least one week. We wanted to reduce that number and figured if we doubled it, we would see a higher rate of change, for better or for worse. After days of observing the results, our risk paid off and the bot saw a faster and more consistent increase in win rate.Once we were sure of the outcome, we began to add in more genes to manipulate from other State Machine weights. Another problem we ran into throughout the project that we had been unable to solve was how to play early on in the game, and how to play near the end. In DotA, the play styles between the two are drastically different. The behaviors that are important early on are less important as the game goes on for longer, and vice versa. Our strategy up to this point had been to trade a slightly weaker start to the game for a more powerful finish. We had tried to tweak the weights multiple times, but even if they played better at the beginning, the manipulated weights would fail in the end dropping the overall win rate. Now that we had our working genetic algorithm, we added in various multipliers to health for it to adjust, but also decided to add in multipliers based on how powerful the hero is. Heroes go from level 1 to 25 and get stronger as they gain levels. By hand we were never able to manipulate the weights in an effective way that would allow for early and late game adjustments. With the genetic algorithm, we could now leave it up to the computer to decide when to play differently.After one more hero change, we settled on our final roster and continued to let the genetic algorithm work. A few days before the beginning of the tournament, we saw that the bot had finally reached a 99% win rate for one generation, but this dropped the next generation to 96%. While our rapid manipulation of genes had created a powerful bot, once it got closer and closer to it‚Äôs theoretical peak, the 25% mutation rate would change to much at once and dropped the win rate. We decided that in order to preserve our win rate, we would need to slow down the mutation. The mutation probability was dropped to 7% and the mutation rate was dropped to 15%.As we changed our genetic algorithm once again, we decided to take another risk. Up to this point we had been taking the top five genes from each hero as parents, breeding them and using the offspring for the next generation. While this had worked for us, classically it was not how we should have been using a genetic algorithm. In a genetic algorithm, all genes should have a chance of being picked, but we were actively selecting which to use. The importance of using the lower win rate bots is diversity. While in the generation it may not have performed as well, in a future generation its genes may be an important part towards increasing the win rate. In order to make sure those lower win rate genes had a chance at being selected, we mapped all of the genes, allowing a higher probability of being picked to the higher win rates, while still giving the lower win rates a chance, albeit smaller.We also discussed a change in strategy. Taking the genes from each individual bot was necessary, but we considered the importance of taking all of the genes from one ‚Äúteam‚Äù of bots. A bot at first glance may have looked like it had less potential, but as part of a team it‚Äôs genes could have been an important key to victory. We thought about the benefits of switching from the individual bots to only breeding teams, but couldn‚Äôt justify losing out on more powerful heroes genes. As we came to the conclusion that we should continue using the same strategy of selecting the individual bots, a thought popped into our heads. What if we do both? Taking the individual genes was undeniably important, but by breeding bots from the same team with the stronger individual bots, we believed we could unlock the potential of both worlds.The genetic algorithm seems to have improved the bot, although its play style is considerably different from the original non-genetic version. While we were much more aggressive earlier, we now play more conservatively and aim to win mostly by destroying structures and winning the occasional team fights. The older bot would group together more often as a team, forcing opponent bots to react and resulting in more fights. If we continued to work on the project, I believe the next step would be having the bot begin to fight itself and the older, non-genetic version of the bot.Through this project, I‚Äôve been able to learn multiple programming languages, as well as familiarize myself with Docker, and the importance of documentation when working as a team. The reason I decided to work on this project was less an interest in DotA2, but more trying to understand machine learning. I‚Äôd heard the term multiple times, had read about it, but didn‚Äôt have a real understanding of what it entailed and how to actually program it. Participating on this project gave me a unique opportunity to work with machine learning, and has increased my understanding of programming as a whole.",31/05/2019,1,0,2,0,859,547,6,0,0,3,117
Building A ‚ÄòServerless‚Äô Chrome Extension,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-serverless-chrome-extension-f684740e1ffc,Bilal Tahir,195,6,907,"This is a tutorial on building a Chrome Extension that leverages Serverless architecture. Specifically ‚Äî we will use Google Cloud Functions in the Back-End of our Chrome Extension to do some fancy Python magic for us.The Extension we will build is the SummarLight Chrome Extension:medium.comThe SummarLight Extension takes the text of he current web page you are on (presumably a cool blog on medium such as mine) and highlights the most important parts of that page/article.In order to do this, we will setup a UI (a button in this case) which will send the text on our current web page to our Back-End. The ‚ÄòBack-End‚Äô in this case will be a Google Cloud Function which will analyze that text and return its Extractive Summary (the most important sentences of that text).As we can see, the architecture is very straightforward and flexible. You can setup a simple UI like an App or, in this case, a Chrome Extension, and pass any complex work to your serverless functions. You can easily change your logic in the function and re-deploy it to try alternative methods. And finally, you can scale it for as many API calls as needed.This is not an article on the benefits of serverless so I will not go into details about the advantages of using it over traditional servers. But usually, a serverless solution can be much cheaper and scalable (but not always‚Ä¶depends on your use case).Here is a good guide on the setup of a Chrome Extension:www.freecodecamp.orgAnd all the code for the SummarLight Extension can be found here:github.comThe main.py file in the root directory is where we define our Google Cloud Function. The extension_bundle folder has all the files that go into creating the Chrome Extension.Google Cloud FunctionI chose Google instead of AWS Lamba because I had some free credits (thanks Google!) but you can easily do it with AWS as well. It was a huge plus for me that they had just released Google Cloud Functions for Python as I do most of my data crunching in that beautiful language.You can learn more about deploying Google Cloud Functions here:cloud.google.comI highly recommend using the gcloud sdk and starting with there hello_world example. You can edit the function in the main.py file they provide for your needs. Here is my function:Pretty straight forward. I receive some text via the read_article() function and then, using the awesome Gensim library, I return a Summary of that text. The Gensim Summary function works by ranking all the sentences in order of importance. In this case, I have chosen to return the top 30% of the most important sentences. This will highlight the top one third of the article/blog.Alternative Approaches: I tried different methods for summarization including using Glove Word Embeddings but the results were not that much better compared to Gensim (especially considering the increased processing compute/time because of loading in those massive embeddings). There is still a lot of room for improvement here though. This is an active area of research and better text summarization approaches are being developed:nlpprogress.comOnce we are good with the function we can deploy it and it will be available at an HTTP endpoint which we can call from our App/Extension.Extension BundleNow for the Front-End. To start, we need a popup.html file. This will deal with the UI part. It will create a menu with a button.As we can see, the ‚ÄòHighlight Summary‚Äô button has an onClick event that triggers the popup.js file. This in turn will call the summarize function:The summarize function calls the content.js script (yeah yeah I know we could have avoided this extra step‚Ä¶).Here is where we parse the html of the page we are currently on (document.body.innerText) and, after some pre-processing with the unicodeToChar function, we send it to our Google Cloud Function via the Fetch API. You can add your own HTTP endpoint url in the api_url variable for this.Again, leveraging Fetch, we return a Promise, which is the summary generated from our serverless function. Once we resolve this, we can parse the loop through the html content of our page and highlight the sentences from our summary.Since ‚Äî it can take a little while for all this processing to be done, we add an alert at the top of the page which will indicate this (‚ÄúGenerating summary highlights. This may take up to 30 seconds depending on length of article."").Finally ‚Äî we need to create a manifest.json file that is needed to publish the Extension:Notice the permissions tab. We have to add our Google Cloud Function URL here to make sure we do not get a CORS error when we call our function via the Fetch API. We also fill out details like the name/description and icons to be displayed for our Chrome Extension on the Google Store.And that‚Äôs it! We have created a Chrome Extension that leverages a serverless backbone aka Google Cloud Function. The end effect is something like this:It‚Äôs a simple but effective way to build really cool Apps/Extensions. Think of some of the stuff you have done in Python. Now you can just hook up your scripts to a button in an Extension/App and make a nice product out of it. All without worrying about any servers or configurations.Here is the Github Repo: https://github.com/btahir/summarlightAnd you can use the Extension yourself. It is live on the Google Store here:chrome.google.comPlease share your ideas for Extensions (or Apps) leveraging Google Cloud Functions in the comments. :)Cheers.",30/05/2019,3,5,3,0,1050,576,2,0,0,7,151
What I Learned from (Two-time) Kaggle Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-i-learned-from-abhishek-thakur-4b905ac0fd55,Dean Sublett,226,5,998,"Before his many data scientist stints in companies scattered throughout Germany, Abhishek Thakur earned his bachelor‚Äôs in electrical engineering at NIT Surat and his master‚Äôs in computer science at the University of Bonn. Currently, he holds the title of Chief Data Scientist at Norway‚Äôs boost.ai, a ‚Äúsoftware company that specializes in conversational artificial intelligence (AI).‚Äù But I‚Äôm most impressed by Abhishek‚Äôs Kaggle clout.You can visit his Kaggle profile here. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of his accolades:I want to take a look at Abhishek‚Äôs tutorial, Approaching (Almost) Any NLP Problem on Kaggle. I‚Äôve selected this kernel of Abhishek‚Äôs because I myself have been trying to learn more about natural language processing, and how could I resist learning with Kaggle‚Äôs Halloween-themed Spooky Authors dataset?I would highly encourage you to read this article alongside the kernel. And if you really want a firmer grasp of NLP or data science in general, be sure that you understand every line of Abhishek‚Äôs code by writing it yourself as you go through his kernel.Just so we don‚Äôt forget ‚Äî our task is to identify the author (EAP ‚Äî Edgar Allen Poe; HPL ‚Äî H.P. Lovecraft; MWS ‚Äî Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley) of each sentence in the test set.1. Exploring the Data and Understanding the ProblemAfter importing the necessary Python modules and the data, Abhishek calls the head() method on the data to see what the first five rows look like. Since Abhishek is a pro and this is an NLP problem, the exploratory data analysis (you‚Äôll most often see this referred to as EDA) is shallow compared to problems involving numerical data. Data science newcomers might benefit from more thorough EDA. A solid exploration of the data can expose any missing values, let you know how much data cleaning you‚Äôll have to do, and help inform your model-building decisions later in the problem.Abhishek also reminds us that we‚Äôre tackling a multiclass text classification problem. It‚Äôs always a good idea not to lose sight of what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish! He notes what evaluation metric Kaggle will use to score submissions. For this competition, Kaggle used multiclass log loss to measure the performance of submitted models. Ideally, our multiclass classification model would have a log loss of 0. Here‚Äôs more on log loss, if you‚Äôre interested.2. PreprocessingNext, Abhishek uses the LabelEncoder() method from scikit-learn to assign an integer value to each author. By encoding the text labels of values in the author column with integer values (0, 1, 2), Abhishek is making the data easier for his classification model to understand.After encoding the author labels, Abhishek splits the data into training and validation sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. He opts for a 90:10 train/validation split (the most frequently utilized splits in Python data science typically range from 70:30 to 80:20). So he intends to train the models on 90% of the sentences in the dataset, and then he‚Äôll evaluate the accuracy of his models on the remaining 10% of the data.3. Building a ModelBefore creating his first model, Abhishek uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency ‚Äî Inverse Document Frequency) on the data. TF-IDF will give weights to the words that appear in the sentences in the text column. So TF-IDF will helps us understand what words are important when we are trying to determine which author wrote a particular sentence ‚Äî words such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù won‚Äôt be important for classifying any author because ‚Äúthe‚Äù appears frequently and doesn‚Äôt reveal much information, but a word like ‚ÄúCthulhu,‚Äù for example, would be very important when classifying sentences written by H.P. Lovecraft. More about TF-IDF can be found here and here.Running this TF-IDF on the data is a form of feature extraction. Here, we needed to derive some sort of significant predictor or feature of the data that would help us figure out which author wrote a particular sentence. With TF-IDF, we have a statistical measure of a word‚Äôs importance that can help us predict the author of the sentence.After fitting the TF-IDF on both the training and validation sets, Abhishek prepares a logistic regression model. If this type of classification model is new to you, read this before continuing. After fitting the logistic regression model, Abhishek calculates the log loss of his logistic regression model (recall that he wrote the multiclass log loss function near the beginning of the kernel). The multiclass log loss function returns a log loss value of 0.626 for the logistic regression model. Although fitting TF-IDF and a logistic regression model gave us a good start, we can improve on this log loss score.4. Model TweakingSo we‚Äôre not satisfied with a log loss score of 0.626 and want to optimize this evaluation metric. From here, we could take a number of routes, and that‚Äôs exactly what Abhishek does. After we‚Äôve explored and preprocessed our data, we‚Äôre left with many different combinations of feature extraction and model fitting. For example, Abhishek uses word counts for feature extraction instead of TF-IDF. With this feature extraction technique, his logistic regression model‚Äôs log loss score improves from 0.626 to 0.528 ‚Äî a whopping 0.098 improvement!Since Abhishek‚Äôs kernel grows increasingly more detailed from this point, I‚Äôll let him do the heavy lifting with explaining the other classification models.Here‚Äôs what we discussed:From here, it‚Äôs up to us to extract features with high predictive power and to pick models that match the problem and optimize the metric we‚Äôre concerned with. Don‚Äôt be afraid to get your hands dirty and experiment with several models ‚Äî you‚Äôre likely to fit a model that optimizes your evaluation metric through more experimentation. I hope after reading this that you better understand how to approach an NLP problem and that you, too, appreciate Abhishek‚Äôs work.Abhishek‚Äôs Kaggle profileAbhishek‚Äôs NLP kernelSpooky Authors datasetWhat is log loss?What is TF-IDF?TF-IDF in layman‚Äôs termsWhat is logistic regression?Here is all of Abhishek‚Äôs code that is referred to in this article.

How to Automate Hyperparameter Optimization,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-automate-hyperparameter-optimization-73950c9fdb5,Suleka Helmini,69,14,2726,"In the machine learning and deep learning paradigm, model ‚Äúparameters‚Äù and ‚Äúhyperparameters‚Äù are two frequently used terms where ‚Äúparameters‚Äù define configuration variables that are internal to the model and whose values can be estimated from the training data and ‚Äúhyperparameters‚Äù define configuration variables that are external to the model and whose values cannot be estimated from the training data ( What is the Difference Between a Parameter and a Hyperparameter? ). Thus, the hyperparameter values need to be manually assigned by the practitioner.Every machine learning and deep learning model that we make has a different set of hyperparameter values that need to be fine-tuned to be able to obtain a satisfactory result. Compared to machine learning models, deep learning models tend to have a larger number of hyperparameters that need optimizing in order to get the desired predictions due to its architectural complexity over typical machine learning models.Repeatedly experimenting with different value combinations manually to derive the optimal hyperparameter values for each of these hyperparameters can be a very time consuming and tedious task that requires good intuition, a lot of experience, and a deep understanding of the model. Moreover, some hyperparameter values may require continuous values, which will have an undefined number of possibilities, and even if the hyperparameters require a discrete value, the number of possibilities is enormous, thus manually performing this task is rather difficult. Having said all that, hyperparameter optimization might seem like a daunting task but thanks to several libraries that are readily available in the cyberspace, this task has become more straightforward. These libraries aid in implementing different hyperparameter optimization algorithms with less effort. A few such libraries are Scikit-Optimize, Scikit-Learn, and Hyperopt.There are several hyperparameter optimization algorithms that have been employed frequently throughout the years, they are Grid Search, Random Search, and automated hyperparameter optimization methods. Grid Search and Random Search both set up a grid of hyperparameters but in Grid Search every single value combination will be exhaustively explored to find the hyperparameter value combination that gives the best accuracy values making this method very inefficient. On the other hand, Random Search will repeatedly select random combinations from the grid until the specified number of iterations is met and is proven to yield better results compared to the Grid Search. However, even though it manages to give a good hyperparameter combination we cannot be certain that it is, in fact, the best combination. Automated hyperparameter optimization uses different techniques like Bayesian Optimization that carries out a guided search for the best hyperparameters ( Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid and Random Search). Research has shown that Bayesian optimization can yield better hyperparameter combinations than Random Search ( Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning).In this article, we will be providing a step-by-step guide into performing a hyperparameter optimization task on a deep learning model by employing Bayesian Optimization that uses the Gaussian Process. We used the gp_minimize package provided by the Scikit-Optimize (skopt) library to perform this task. We will be performing the hyperparameter optimization on a simple stock closing price forecasting model developed using TensorFlow.Scikit-Optimize is a library that is relatively easy to use than other hyperparameter optimization libraries and also has better community support and documentation. This library implements several methods for sequential model-based optimization by reducing expensive and noisy black-box functions. For more information you can refer neptune.ai‚Äôs article where they have done a comprehensive analysis on the capabilities and usage of skopt.Bayesian optimization is one of the many functions that skopt offers. Bayesian optimization finds a posterior distribution as the function to be optimized during the parameter optimization, then uses an acquisition function (eg. Expected Improvement-EI, another function etc) to sample from that posterior to find the next set of parameters to be explored. Since Bayesian optimization decides the next point based on more systematic approach considering the available data it is expected to yield achieve better configurations faster compared to the exhaustive parameter optimization techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search. You can read more about the Bayesian Optimizer in skopt from here.So, enough with the theory, let‚Äôs get down to business!This example code is done using python and TensorFlow. Furthermore, the goal of this hyperparameter optimization task is to obtain the set of hyperparameter values that can give the lowest possible Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for our deep learning model. We hope this will be very straight forward for any first-timer.First, let us install Scikit-Optimize. You can install it using pip by executing this command.Please note that you will have to make some adjustments to your existing deep learning model code in order to make it work with the optimization.First, let‚Äôs do some necessary imports.We will now set the TensorFlow and Numpy seed as we want to get reproducible results.Shown below are some essential python global variables that we have declared. Among the variables, we have also declared the hyperparameters that we are hoping to optimize (the 2nd set of variables).The ‚Äúinput_size‚Äù depicts a part of the shape of the prediction. The ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù depict the number of features in the data set and the ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù list has the header names of the two features. The ‚Äúcolumn_min_max‚Äù variable contains the upper and lower scaling bounds of both the features (this was taken by examining validation and training splits).After declaring all these variables it‚Äôs finally time to declare the search space for each of the hyperparameters we are hoping to optimize.If you look closely you will be able to see that we have declared the ‚Äòlstm_init_learning_rate‚Äô prior to log-uniform without just putting uniform. What this does is that, if you had put prior as uniform, the optimizer will have to search from 1e-4 (0.0001 ) to 1e-1 (0.1) in a uniform distribution. But when declared as log-uniform, the optimizer will search between -4 and -1, thus making the process much more efficient. This has been advised when assigning the search space for learning rate by the skopt library.There are several data types using which you can define the search space. Those are Categorical, Real and Integer. When defining a search space that involves floating point values you should go for ‚ÄúReal‚Äù and if it involves integers, go for ‚ÄúInteger‚Äù. If your search space involves categorical values like different activation functions, then you should go for the ‚ÄúCategorical‚Äù type.We are now going to put down the parameters that we are going to optimize in the ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô list. This list will be passed to the ‚Äògp_minimize‚Äô function later on. You can see that we have also declared the ‚Äòdefault_parameters‚Äô. These are the default parameter values we have given to each hyperparameter. Remember to type in the default values in the same order as you listed the hyperparameters in the ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô list.The most important thing to remember is that the hyperparameters in the ‚Äúdefault_parameters‚Äù list will be the starting point of your optimization task. The Bayesian Optimizer will use the default parameters that you have declared in the first iteration and depending on the result, the acquisition function will determine which point it wants to explore next.It can be said that if you have run the model several times previously and found a decent set of hyperparameter values, you can put them as the default hyperparameter values and start your exploration from there. What this may do is that it will help the algorithm find the lowest RMSE value faster (fewer iterations). However, do keep in mind that this might not always be true. Also, remember to assign a value that is within the search space that you have defined when assigning the default values.What we have done up to now is setting up all the initial work for the hyperparameter optimization task. We will now focus on the implementation of our deep learning model. We will not be discussing the data pre-processing of the model development process as this article only focuses on the hyperparameter optimization task. We will include the GitHub link of the complete implementation at the end of this article.However, to give you a little bit more context, we divided our data set into three splits for training, validation, and testing. The training set was used to train the model and the validation set was used to do the hyperparameter optimization task. As mentioned before, we are using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model and perform the optimization (minimize RMSE).The accuracy assessed using the validation split cannot be used to evaluate the model since the selected hyperparameters minimizing the RMSE with validation split can be overfitted to the validation set during the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, it is standard procedure to use a test split that has not used at any point in the pipeline to measure the accuracy of the final model.Shown below is the implementation of our deep learning model:The ‚ÄúsetupRNN‚Äù function contains our deep learning model. Still, you may not want to understand those details, as Bayesian optimization considers that function as a black-box that takes certain hyperparameters as the inputs and then outputs the prediction. So if you are not interested in understanding what we have inside that function, you may skip the next paragraph.Our deep learning model contains an LSTM layer, a dropout layer and an output layer. The necessary information required for the model to work needs to be sent to this function (in our case, it was the input and the dropout rate). You can then proceed with implementing your deep learning model inside this function. In our case, we used an LSTM layer to identify the temporal dependencies of our stock data-set.We then fed the last output of the LSTM to the dropout layer for regularization purposes and obtained the prediction through the output layer. Finally, remember to return this prediction (in a classification task this can be your logit) to the function that will be passed to the Bayesian Optimization ( ‚ÄúsetupRNN‚Äù will be called by this function).If you are performing a hyperparameter optimization for a machine learning algorithm (using a library like Scikit-Learn) you will not need a separate function to implement your model as the model itself is already given by the library and you will only be writing code to train and obtain predictions. Therefore, this code can go inside the function that will be returned to the Bayesian Optimization.We have now come to the most important section of the hyperparameter optimization task, the ‚Äòfitness‚Äô function.As shown above, we are passing the hyperparameter values to a function named ‚Äúfitness.‚Äù The ‚Äúfitness‚Äù function will be passed to the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization process ( gp_minimize). Note that in the first iteration, the values passed to this function will be the default values that you defined and from there onward Bayesian Optimization will choose the hyperparameter values on its own. We then assign the chosen values to the python global variables we declared at the beginning so that we will be able to use the latest chosen hyperparameter values outside the fitness function.We then come to a rather critical point in our optimization task. If you have used TensorFlow prior to this article, you would know that TensorFlow operates by creating a computational graph for any kind of deep learning model that you make.During the hyperparameter optimization process, in each iteration, we will be resetting the existing graph and constructing a new one. This process is done to minimize the memory taken for the graph and prevent the graphs from stacking on top of each other. Immediately after resetting the graph you will have to set the TensorFlow random seed in order to obtain reproducible results. After the above process, we can finally declare the TensorFlow session.After this point, you can start adding code responsible for training and validating your deep learning model as you normally would. This section is not really related to the optimization process but the code after this point will start utilizing the hyperparameter values chosen by the Bayesian Optimization.The main point to remember here is to return the final metric value (in this case the RMSE value) obtained for the validation split. This value will be returned to the Bayesian Optimization process and will be used when deciding the next set of hyperparameters that it wants to explore.Note: if you are dealing with a classification problem you would want to put your accuracy as a negative value (eg. -96) because, even though the higher the accuracy the better the model, the Bayesian function will keep trying to reduce the value as it is designed to find the hyperparameter values for the lowest value that is returned to it.Let us now put down the execution point for this whole process, the ‚Äúmain‚Äù function. Inside the main function, we have declared the ‚Äúgp_minimize‚Äù function. We are then passing several essential parameters to this function.The ‚Äúfunc‚Äù parameter is the function you would want to finally model using the Bayesian Optimizer. The ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù parameter is the set of hyperparameters that you are hoping to optimize and the ‚Äúacq_func‚Äù stands for the acquisition function and is the function that helps to decide the next set of hyperparameter values that should be used. There are 4 types of acquisition functions supported by gp_minimize. They are:The above information was extracted from the documentation. Each of these has its own advantages but if you are a beginner to Bayesian Optimization, try using ‚ÄúEI‚Äù or ‚Äúgp_hedge‚Äù as ‚ÄúEI‚Äù is the most widely used acquisition function and ‚Äúgp_hedge‚Äù will choose one of the above-stated acquisition functions probabilistically thus, you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry too much about that.Keep in mind that when using different acquisition functions there might be other parameters that you might want to change that affects your chosen acquisition function. Please refer the parameter list in the documentation for this.Back to explaining the rest of the parameters, the ‚Äún_calls‚Äù parameter is the number of times you would want to run the fitness function. The optimization task will start by using the hyperparameter values defined by ‚Äúx0‚Äù, the default hyperparameter values. Finally, we are setting the random state of the hyperparameter optimizer as we need reproducible results.Now when you run the gp_optimize function the flow of events will be:The fitness function will use with the parameters passed to x0. The LSTM will be trained with the specified epochs and the validation input will be run to get the RMSE value for its predictions. Then depending on that value, the Bayesian optimizer will decide what the next set of hyperparameter values it wants to explore with the help of the acquisition function.In the 2nd iteration, the fitness function will run with the hyperparameter values that the Bayesian optimization has derived and the same process will repeat until it has iterated ‚Äún_call‚Äù times. When the complete process comes to an end, the Scikit-Optimize object will get assigned to the ‚Äúsearch _result‚Äù variable.We can use this object to retrieve useful information as stated in the documentation.The ‚Äúsearch_result.x‚Äù gives us optimal hyperparameter values and using ‚Äúsearch_result.fun‚Äù we can obtain the RMSE value of the validation set corresponding to the obtained hyperparameter values (The lowest RMSE value obtained for the validation set).Shown below are the optimal hyperparameter values that we obtained for our model and the lowest RMSE value of the validation set. If you are finding it hard to figure out the order in which the hyperparameter values are being listed when using ‚Äúsearch_result.x‚Äù, it is in the same order as you specified your hyperparameters in the ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù list.Hyperparameter Values:Lowest RMSE: 2.73755355221523The hyperparameters that produced the lowest point of the Bayesian Optimization in this graph is what we get as the optimal set of hyperparameter values.The graph shows a comparison of the lowest RMSE values recorded for each iteration (50 iterations) in Bayesian Optimization and Random Search. We can see that the Bayesian Optimization has been able to converge rather better than the Random Search. However, in the beginning, we can see that Random search has found a better minimum faster than the Bayesian Optimizer. This can be due to random sampling being the nature of Random Search.We have finally come to the end of this article, so to conclude, we hope this article made your deep learning model building task easier by showing you a better way of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters. Here‚Äôs to no more stressing over hyperparameter optimization. Happy coding, fellow geeks!Originally published at https://dzone.com.",30/05/2019,1,9,6,6,1050,699,2,4,0,19,168
What if AI model understanding were easy?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-if-ai-model-understanding-were-easy-57ba21163d0e,Cassie Kozyrkov,111000,8,1456,"Let‚Äôs talk about the What-If Tool, as in ‚ÄúWhat if getting a look at your model performance and data during ML/AI development weren‚Äôt such a royal pain in the butt?‚Äù (Or ignore my chatter and scroll straight to the walkthrough screenshots below!)Being able to get a grip on your progress is the key to speedy iteration towards an awesome ML/AI solution, so good tools designed for analysts working in the machine learning space help them help you meet ambitious targets and catch problems like AI bias before it hurts your users.The What-If Tool is for speedy machine learning analytics, built to accelerate iterative model development and training.Analytics is not about proving anything, so this tool won‚Äôt help with that. Instead, it‚Äôll help you discover the unknown unknowns in your data faster. Learn more about explainable AI (XAI) and its limitations here.The What-If Tool is for speedy machine learning analytics, built to accelerate iterative model development and training. The first version (released in late 2018) was pretty, but you couldn‚Äôt use it unless you were all-in on TensorFlow. As someone who appreciates the expediency of tools like Scikit Learn, I‚Äôm delighted that What-If Tool is now geared at all analysts working with models in Python.No more TensorFlow exclusivity!We‚Äôve been incorporating feedback from internal and external users to make the tool awesome for data scientists, researchers, and corporate megateams alike. Learn more about our UX journey here. Without further ado, let me make myself a hexpresso and play with the most current version to give you my take on what‚Äôs awesome and what‚Äôs awful.In the current version of What-If Tool, we expanded access to the magic beyond TensorFlow afficionados. Yes, that‚Äôs right ‚Äî no more TF-exclusivity! This is model understanding and quick data exploration for feature selection/preprocessing insights even if you‚Äôre allergic to TensorFlow. Want to compare models made in Scikit Learn or PyTorch? Step right up! Does it work with standard Jupyter notebooks? You bet! It also works with Colaboratory because we know you prefer to choose your weapon. The tool is designed to reduce the amount of code you need to write to get your eyes on your data, so it‚Äôs built for ease of use.The What-If Tool is not going to give you every slice of every view of every way that you might want to explore your data. But it‚Äôs great at what it‚Äôs designed for: a first start with low effort. It also works on a subsample, which means you get a quick look quickly without having to pay the memory cost to ingest and process all your data if you don‚Äôt want to. Huzzah for speed!It‚Äôs great at what it‚Äôs designed for: a first look with low effort.The What-If Tool is also your secret weapon for fighting AI bias. To understand why, check out my discussion of AI bias here. Its bias-catching features are not an accident ‚Äî a large fraction of the project‚Äôs core team hails from Google Brain‚Äôs PAIR initiative aimed at human-centered research and design to make AI partnerships productive, enjoyable, and fair.The What-If Tool incorporates the Facets tool, which tackles the data analytics piece without the model understanding component.What-If puts both together to help you iterate smartly. Think of it like this: to figure out what to do next in the kitchen, you want a handy way to compare the tastiness of several potential recipes (with model understanding) and also getting a handle on what‚Äôs in your grocery bags (with data analytics) so you don‚Äôt accidentally use rotten tomatoes. Facets gave you eyes on your ingredients, while the What-If Tool goes a step further to deliver that plus the recipe comparison. If you‚Äôve been cooking blindly, you‚Äôll love this tool for iterative model development and training.Never underestimate the power of being able to ask your own what-if questions, like ‚ÄúWhat if we raise this person‚Äôs work hours and change their gender? How does the model react?‚Äù The What-If Tool is purpose-built to give you more of a grip on guided what-if/counterfactual questions. The tool makes it easy to see how the prediction changes if you vary a variable (finally!) over its domain and shows you whether there‚Äôs some value where the prediction behaves in a suspicious way and letting you see exactly where the classification flips from, say, NO to YES. Try playing with the counterfactual options to find a datapoint‚Äôs most similar counterpart in a different predicted class. It‚Äôs a great way to see the effects of subtle differences on your model‚Äôs output.The tool isn‚Äôt perfect yet. For example, you‚Äôll occasionally stumble onto something guaranteed to earn a scowl from Tufte fans ‚Äî for example, the screenshot below had me ranting in a meeting recently. (If you can‚Äôt see why, it‚Äôs a good opportunity for a little data viz lesson: Why are the text labels ‚ÄúYoung‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Young‚Äù the only visual cues? Why not shape? Because we‚Äôre working on making it better in this way and in others too, but perfection takes time. As part of the collaboration, I rant on your behalf to help these issues should dissipate rapidly.)Also‚Ä¶ how about them axis labels?The tool will go where your curiosity takes it, but what do you do if you‚Äôre not feeling creative? Perhaps you wish the tool were more prescriptive, guiding your eye towards what‚Äôs important? Your feedback is on our radar and we‚Äôre working on it, but for those who think something beautiful might be lost if your exploration gets hemmed in, never fear! We believe in options and understand that not everyone wants the prescriptive side of things, just as not everyone wants to play video games with a fixed storyline as opposed to an open world.You want every customization under the sun, which is such a data-sciency thing to say. I‚Äôve said things like that too ‚Äî I remember the first question I asked in a mandatory SAS training for stats PhD students: ‚ÄúHow do I write these functions myself so they do exactly what I want?‚Äù.So when you ask the same thing about the What-If Tool, I‚Äôll tell you what my profs told me that day: that‚Äôs what raw Python and R are for! (Or, heaven help us, C/C++ if you‚Äôre going that far down into the weeds.) Visualization tools like the What-If Tool aren‚Äôt replacements, they‚Äôre accelerators. They give you a first look with minimal effort so you know where to dig, but once you‚Äôve picked your spot, you‚Äôre probably going to want to write your own code to dig exactly the way you like to. If you‚Äôre an expert analyst with your own awesome way of doing things, our goal is to help you narrow your search so there‚Äôs less code to write later, not to replace your entire approach.Another thing that irritates me (and the rest of statistician-kind, I‚Äôm sure) is the terminology compromises we had to make for the sake of our TensorFlow user group, keeping some of the TensorFlow legacy lingo that makes traditional data scientists want to punch something. Yeah, that ‚Äúinference‚Äù isn‚Äôt inference. TensorFlow is a hilarious bucket of words appropriated and promptly misused ‚Äî fellow nerds, don‚Äôt even get me started on its use of ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù, ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù, ‚Äúestimator‚Äù, or the batch vs minibatch thing‚Ä¶ Just let this be a lesson about thinking carefully about what you‚Äôre calling things when it‚Äôs just you and your buddies bouncing some ideas around in a garage. What if the project is a success and everyone will have to live with your choices? Sigh.All in all, these grumbles are on the petty side. Overall, I really like the What-If Tool and I hope you will too.While the What-If Tool is not designed for novices (you need to know your way around the basics and it‚Äôs best if this isn‚Äôt your first rodeo with Python or notebooks), it‚Äôs an awesome accelerant for the practicing analyst and ML engineer.If you‚Äôre eager to see the What-If Tool in action, you don‚Äôt have to install anything ‚Äî just go here. We‚Äôve got dazzling demos and docs aplenty. If you want to start using it for realsies, you don‚Äôt even need to install TensorFlow. Simply pip install witwidget.If you‚Äôre a fan of Google Cloud Platform, you might be excited by a new integration that just got announced. Now you can connect your AI Platform model to the What-If Tool with just one method call! Check out how here.If you had fun here and you‚Äôre looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here‚Äôs one I made for your amusement:Let‚Äôs be friends!

How to Teach Code,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-code-a4d8ee29e14e,Sam Harris,558,21,4575,"Learning to code is really hard and teaching code is even harder. There is no bootcamp in ‚ÄòHow to Teach Code‚Äô. Most teachers do not have any formal training in education and come from a software background.I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working with several bootcamps in different ways (as a student, teacher or experience partner). I‚Äôve also:It‚Äôs amazing how little regulation there is in teaching code. The result is students can receive wildly different experiences. I‚Äôve seen some of the best education on the planet being given away for free. Yet I‚Äôve also seen other bootcamps delivering their students 3 months of confusion and charged ¬£9,000 for the pleasure.I‚Äôve seen bootcamps struggle along until they inevitably fail whilst others just continue to grow and grow. Taking students money to deliver them a poor education is wrong but I also don‚Äôt think it was anyone‚Äôs intention to just steal from people.With potential huge swathes of current jobs being taken over by software, there are more students than ever looking to transfer into a technical role.Stories like the Mined Minds fiasco are just the surface of a very big problem. Rather than just talking about how big the problem is it makes sense to do something to fix it.Below is what I‚Äôve learnt myself about the difficulties in teaching code. How to teach code it in a way that gives the best experience for students. And how to grow a sustainable business by delivering a great experience.(Note ‚Äî as a student on a bootcamp it is worth reading this. If your course if making some of these mistakes you might be able to help save your education by encouraging some better practices.)Learning to speak computer is hard. Due to general variance in the way we think, perceive and learn things; some people find it frustratingly easy and other people find it impossible. For the average person, it‚Äôs just really hard. However, it is totally doable‚Ä¶Learning your second and third computer language is comparatively easier and only gets easier the more you know.The problem with teaching it is that you have to know a lot about talking computer before you are qualified to teach others to speak computer. Yet for you learning a new computer language is now quite easy. It‚Äôs hard to understand the difficulties you faced 10 years ago. For you, it‚Äôs just assigning a new bunch of syntax into ready-made concepts.The first human spoken language is the hardest to learn as you‚Äôve never learnt a language before. Privileged students get taught Latin to understand the roots of how languages are built. They can quickly understand new modern languages that are used around the world with this core knowledge. Similarly, computer scientists commonly learn C so they can understand the root of most languages they encounter, even though they don‚Äôt expect to really ever use it.Learning a language in school is good. You slowly build up a bunch of syntax over many years and eventually get you to be able to understand and speak most things, but it takes immersion to really get the context and master it.Alternatively, you can go to a foreign country and with lessons and constant immersion you will learn a lot more in 3 months. But this is still a bewildering and challenging experience and you wouldn‚Äôt be qualified to take on a high-level job in a complex business environment, but you could work in a coffee shop just fine.Compared to speaking computer though, you already know your mother tongue, this is your language zero and it gives you have a bunch of template concepts to reference from.People don‚Äôt speak computer, there is no language zero for any frame of reference the first time they learn.You can practice speaking computer a few hours every week to learn syntax, but it will take you years to become proficient. If you study a lot of hours a week it might take you a year to feel comfortable. Or you could even do a 3 month bootcamp with full immersion.However, you still aren‚Äôt a master and a lot of what you say (write) will come out a bit retarded and a lot of what other people say to you may go over your head, but in your own time, you can look it up and build from there.You won‚Äôt be qualified to demand a high-level job but entry-level junior work is perfect.In summary, learning a completely new thing is not easy and teaching something you know deeply to a beginner has a lot of challenges you need to be mindful of.This is the broad-line concept of the difficulties to teach someone their first programming language. The rest of this blog answers the original question of ‚ÄòHow To Teach Code‚ÄôA teacher will commonly like to show students everything they need to ever know about a concept so they can kick off and be a pro. This could be an hour lecture. Computer scientists (after learning C) can handle that. Code newbies can‚Äôt.After the first 5 minutes of lecturing anything else you say is pointless and goes over their heads. Stop talking and go through some exercises they can follow along.(If you‚Äôre learning via video stop after 5 minutes and do the exercises).Exercises need to be pitched at the right level at the right time. With a group of studnets who learn at different paces and in different styles, this is no easy task. It can take mastery to understand what is appropriate when and I cover this later on.Lets pause for another analogy.Lecture 1. You go deep into the physics of how balancing on a bike works and the shifting of body weight to apply correct force on the pedal to provide momentum. This is core stuff and super important.Pause for a coffee break, your structuring the day well.Lecture 2. You talk about steering and how to lean into the corners. It doesn‚Äôt take as long as expected. Your on a roll and a bit excited so you explain how riding no hands isn‚Äôt even that hard when you understand the above processes correctly. One student, Jimmy, say‚Äôs he rode a bike once before and say‚Äôs no hands is really hard. You cleverly correct him that it just takes proper understanding of the physics and he clearly wasn‚Äôt taught very well by his last teacher.Wow that was fun. Lunch break ‚Äî yea, munchtime whooop!. You tell some students about times you were cycling in the alps and how beautiful it was, but also remind them how you cycle to work every day even in the rain, being a cyclist isn‚Äôt all fun and it‚Äôs good you‚Äôve told them the high‚Äôs and lows. (You make sure Jimmy was listening. what a dick.)Afternoon ‚Äî lets put it all together!You jump on a bike and cycle around the class for a bit so students can see just how it works in the real world. You over-emphasise you‚Äôre movements and almost fall off yourself showing them how to lean into corners as your going slowly so they can see it properly. It all must be coming together in their minds in glorious perfection. Shit they must know everything about biking by now.You are such a good teacher these are going to be the best bikers ever.Delay other plansYou already have plans of how you are going to explain changing gears, navigating the road safely, fixing punctures but it‚Äôs really time to give them a go. You check you metal list of biking and yep, you‚Äôve really taught them the core fundamentals that covers everything you need to practically ride a bike.That other stuff is extra fluff and you had time to throw in the no hands concept for anyone that gets it quickly. (that was smart, go you!)The big eventYou the hand each of the students a bike.The first student falls flat on the floor like some retard. Two others try to help him but now another student tries to get on their bike and she falls into them causing a mess. Blimey they are so stupid. These are going to be the slow group, you make a note to spend extra time with this group an walk over to help.You untangle their bikes and try to hide you‚Äôre bafflement at how stupid they are as you ask them what the problem is. You‚Äôre distracted by a loud yelp and look up to see there is chaos everywhere. What‚Äôs going on? Why don‚Äôt they get it. Next thing you know your rushing round madly trying to help each student get on a bloody bicycle but none of them seem to understand the first concept of how to even maintain equal balance. This was the start of the first lecture, they must have understood that they were all listening!Soon one student is crying, two have injuries and another is walking out the door claiming they are never going to be able to ride a bike. Smart arse Jimmy smart trousers, smart ideas, clever twat walks up to you. He asks why you didn‚Äôt just give them fucking stabilisers.This is really awkward.Death by TheoryAt its simple level coding is just knowing a bunch of syntax and the context around when to use it. That is literally it. in fact you don‚Äôt even need to know the syntax all that well if your able to look it up at the right time.But like learning to bike the theory is largely pointless without doing any coding. After 5 minutes of talking anything else is wasted. The student has no real concept of what you are actually saying and however, much context and syntax you throw at them it still doesn‚Äôt help.People learn by doing.Students might look like they‚Äôre following along but if they aren‚Äôt doing something their minds regularly wander away from any abstract theory, even when they are trying to concentrate and even when its 6 minutes in.Don‚Äôt even bother showing them the super simple version of a use case, just do it with them.Together make the simplest core example of this concept/method/function without anything else clouding it. Just the syntax of what it is. Then have them build it again but with a different variable.Depending on the concept give a slightly more complicated version or go into some of the context of where to use it. Then do let provide some exercises for them to do on it.Carry on building the layers of complexion along with them with bigger pauses for longer unassisted exercises as you go further.By the afternoon they are ready to use the set of idea‚Äôs all together in a project situation or in solving harder algorithms. Don‚Äôt teach them more shit. Just be there to guide them as different things go wrong and let them self learn and really explore what they can do with what you taught them in the morning.Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it‚Äôs worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.Steve JobsIn terms of a recipe for building exercises, start with SYNTAXComplete newbieGive them a small amount of syntax. Have them use it.If this is day one of learning a language then you‚Äôre probably going to have to teach some more syntax and have them use that.After they‚Äôve learnt a few things they can put these different syntax‚Äôs together to have them interact and start understanding the context of what they‚Äôve learnt.Deep diveIf this is a few weeks into learning a framework then they might need some context first. But keep it short.Code used to cover a concept may be in various places across multiple files and there may not be an intuitive first place to teach syntax from. Try and start with the first logical user action. Don‚Äôt show them the whole path followed by the user action just show them the syntax of the first piece of code you write to deal with it.Then add in the context of what that does and which other files or functions it might be interacting with. Go through the syntax of the interaction with the second file/function from the first one.Build the full context of all interactions with this first function. Then follow the paths of the second function, third etc‚Ä¶ until you have closed the loop.Make sure you have made the loop of logic as small and clean as possible for this first demo and ideally have something happen at the end of it. If it is a really long loop then break for some exercises before completing the whole thing.CommentsAs you‚Äôre going along it is also handy to put comments on each function / method so the students have a well commented demo file they have built themselves to refer back to. Of course, it also gets them into good practice blah blah‚Ä¶ConsolePrint out a lot of what you're doing along the way to show what each thing is doing and what the student should expect to along the path of logic. this can help provide context and help them master debugging so you don‚Äôt spend as much time helping them in debugging.Separate Projects and examplesWhen teaching a framework you‚Äôll usually have a project that everyone is working on to provide the overall context and get them building something themselves. Something like a Facebook for Cats etc.. Whilst giving lesson examples its tempting to just show them using the same project analogy. It is really important that you use a different project analogy.It could just be a Facebook for Dogs so the student just changes the word dog to cat.but ideally you want it to be a slightly different concept so all the further back end things will have different names such as database collections etc‚Ä¶It‚Äôs important to provide a list of useful resources but you must also expect that not a single resource will be used unless you give them a specific reason to use it in their exercises.So the most important resources you should blend into their exercises.So an exercise asking for a super simple API reference look up of a specific term they are using will get them using API docs. You want to end up with them navigating these themselves without ever having to ask but to start with you need to do it for them.ExampleYou are teaching callbacks and you want them to use the loupe tool. Don‚Äôt just leave it hidden in a list of useful stuff to explore. Literally, give them a few exercises where they have to interpret a callback function you‚Äôve given them by using the tool. Then perhaps they can try making the callback function work differently still using the tool.Now, whenever they are stuck on callbacks they will instantly think to go and use the tool and probably have it saved in their favourites. See how useful this is compared to it being hidden in a slide deck they won‚Äôt have open next week when they get stuck.As with the resources. it's tempting to just give a list of extra work which students must do. But just assume that it largely won‚Äôt be done. Everything that must be learnt to get to the next level must be explained and done inside the classroom.Students need to get closure on an idea and way to cement it going forwards. Allow time and space in your working day or at the end of each week for students to step back and assess which things they have learnt well and which things challenge them. They need to identify the key parts they need to practice more.This is especially important over weekends. It‚Äôs so tempting to provide big projects as they love building stuff. Students aren‚Äôt stupid. If they have the correct tools they can make projects themselves that add complexity and this should be self-lead. Sure students are keen to learn as quickly as possible but some will always have a reason to not be working on the weekend, be it a job or a birthday or just life‚Ä¶.What should be enforced is reviewing any content they haven‚Äôt understood and making sure they have caught up with that. By next week you need everyone at the same level ready to move onto the next set of concepts on an even footing.Example Bad Homework ‚Äî Add google maps journey for each cat user in their Catbook project.Some students will get really into it and learn lots. Whilst other students might be working all weekend to pay for their course and still lost on stuff from the week before. It isn‚Äôt fair to assume all students have mastered the GoogleMaps API by Monday morning as this simply isn‚Äôt the case.You shouldn‚Äôt require Maps API knowledge for the next lessons and should teach the new things yourself first.Example Good Homework ‚Äî Take a test of the things covered in the week. Any identified weak points complete suggested extra exercisesThis homework helps students get closure on what they have been learning during the week so that as a teacher you know that what the course directly covers is being learnt.As an extra, you could suggest the maps project idea for those with time to learn cool stuff. You don‚Äôt want to hold people back that can learn faster than others. But you also don‚Äôt want them to be learning lots of new material that you will cover later as they will get further ahead than the others.It is generally better to try and get them to a higher state of proficiency in the same topic rather than them just learning the topic for next week which will give you a completely divided class.Having a good feedback loop for students to anonymously give their opinions is essential. I‚Äôve explained the fundamental layout and speed of teaching a concept, but in the real world, your students should be setting the speed.Having data on what your students do and don‚Äôt understand is essential. It allows you to dynamically deliver the best content at the right time and to continuously improve it for later students.As part of feedback simply asking questions during any lecture can be your speedometer on the fly. This seems obvious but is actually an art in itself.You must AVOID LOADED QUESTIONSWhen you finish explaining something difficult, don‚Äôt simply ask if that is okay. If you don‚Äôt get any real answer this is not a sign to simply move on.Instead try asking if someone can explain the concept back to the class. Now if you don‚Äôt get an answer is that a sign to move on? Of course not.When your starting off people will be shy and won‚Äôt really say anything. If you pick a student to explain a concept and they look at you with eyes of terror, don‚Äôt just move on! It may save them embarrassment but it doesn‚Äôt solve their problem. Go back through the concept in a more simple way or ask a more simple question.As you get to know the class and they get to know each other this will be easier. You should cultivate them getting comfortable talking in front of others. They should be confident to try and explain things they don‚Äôt really understand. Then you can see exactly the parts they do and don‚Äôt get. Ideally, you can have an active group discussion which is a great dynamic to hear different people‚Äôs understanding.A good exercise can be pausing the whole class and getting pairs of students to explain a concept to each other. When two students who are clueless get a chance to find out the other person has no idea what is going on, they don‚Äôt feel embarrassed to ask a question or admit they don‚Äôt understand.After the 60-second break, people will be psychologically ready to talk and when you ask for feedback on which groups got it you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs going on. Even if only one person in the whole room got it you‚Äôll know and they can explain it to everyone. You‚Äôre quickly breaking down the barriers to an open discussion and cultivating peer-learning instead of isolated drifting.Trying to teach students of varying degrees of proficiency is a nightmare and a recipe for complete disaster.If your course accepts absolute beginners then it is an absolute beginners course. Having more advanced people on the course will course a nightmare as you try and teach different levels to different people.Even with just a group of absolute beginners, most will be very slow. You risk some students finding out they hate it whilst others finding out they are geniuses and going at a million miles an hour.Most courses are aimed at people who have a basic understanding of JS, CSS and HTML. I personally think it is wrong to take money of any student for a one month or longer course if they have never coded before. They have no idea if they would like it or would be good at it and need to at least have some form of test experience first.The best strategy is to have some none-arbitrary pre-requisites that all students have to pass to be eligible to take the course. This will cut out the people that aren‚Äôt right for coding and will mean you have a group of people who are able and interested to learn. You could offer a small pre-course for those to learn the basics with you or facilitate the odd meetup each week for newbies to work on the pre-course stuff and learn what‚Äôs right for them.I appreciate that a Bootcamp is a business and teachers need to earn money, classrooms need to be paid for. But it is very important that you turn away people who should not on the course.It is better to deliver a good education to a few people than to sell an education you can‚Äôt deliver to many people. The ones who could have learnt will have reduced learning and the ones that shouldn‚Äôt be there will fail and demand their money back. You will have chaos on your hands and a bunch of bad reviews and your business will go nowhere.If you only give your education to those capable of receiving it you will supply a great experience and deliver a cohort of students that will represent and grow your brand. This will lead to a sustainable long-term business.Considering I run the Growth Mindset Podcast which teaches how you can do anything and to never tie yourself into negative beliefs. I don‚Äôt believe everyone should learn to code.I agree that hypothetically any human capable of learning a language should be able to learn a set of definitions and behaviours for a group of new words and thus eventually be able to learn to programme. But, how many people:Not everyone would enjoy it at all and accepting someone onto a course who has suddenly developed an aspiration to learn tech who has never typed a line of code in their life is dangerous.In much the same way, any human who can sit still for 5 minutes without their phone or a book or TV is completely physically able to take a 10-day meditation retreat. On the retreat, they need to sit still for ten days in silence and not read, write or watch anything but their own mind. I‚Äôm pretty sure it wouldn‚Äôt be most peoples cup of tea.Ultimately, some people will have a much happier life without ever learning to code and it isn‚Äôt anyones duty to try and force and bunch of information into someone‚Äôs brain that doesn‚Äôt need it. And you certainly shouldn‚Äôt convince someone to pay for something that isn‚Äôt right for them.I‚Äôll repeat, learning to code is really hard and mastering it is a long road. But learning to teach coding is just as hard and there is a much less documented set of resources.It is really exciting to empower people with such an awesome skill. You want the class to learn as much as possible from their time with you but teaching newbies is depressingly slow if you‚Äôve never done it before.Instead of trying to teach them as much as possible you need to focus on teaching them as well as possible. If they have no depth in their knowledge your teaching has been completely pointless.There is no point rushing to complete everything they need to know to build a full-stack application when they haven‚Äôt understood all the parts you‚Äôve taught so far. If you find yourself doing parts for them and they don‚Äôt understand everything they can‚Äôt do it without you. When they leave the course they won‚Äôt be able to do it again and you won‚Äôt have a bunch of students going out to the world showcasing how good your course was.Some of the best bootcamps just focus on getting really good at the core concepts so that students have the power to teach themselves things like React and other frameworks afterwards. If they tried to stuff it all into a zero-to-hero course they end up with a lot of people who don‚Äôt quite make it and just fall back to zero afterwards.It‚Äôs better to teach them half as much material and have them master it. They must feel really confident to go out and carry on using what they know and build on it. If they finish with confusion about the stuff you‚Äôve taught them they won‚Äôt be able to get jobs or make cool shit => the course and your efforts will all be for nothing.Just like building software, it‚Äôs done when it‚Äôs done. You can‚Äôt release an app that‚Äôs 90% done as it just doesn‚Äôt work. When teaching important concepts if students 90% get it but can‚Äôt practically explain how to use it then they can‚Äôt use it.Don‚Äôt teach them more stuff in the hope it will just happen to make sense. Complete what you‚Äôve started or empower them to get the final 10% as their homework.Like learning anything, learning to teach needs baby steps and learning by doing is key. It‚Äôs better to practice teaching in a smaller environment before launching into a full course.Try running a meetup event or a weekend course. Find some students to mentor. I love it but you might hate it and you can‚Äôt tell unless you‚Äôve tried.This may sound obvious but some people literally start a bootcamp and day 1 is the first time they have ever tried to teach someone coding. DO NOT DO THIS!Teaching is the best thing in the world. It‚Äôs not easy but soon all your students will be talking computer and you‚Äôll be so proud of getting them to talk properly. Even smart arses like Jimmy (see bike analogy) if you haven‚Äôt killed them in the process. Watching them master the skills and go out in the world and build cool things is just awesome.So please try out these principles, add your own personal flavour on top, and provide any comments to help others teach better.If you enjoyed this post you might like some of my other writing about Coding and learning:I run the Growth Mindset Podcast where I break down the leading ideas in psychology, business, and life. You can find out more about me on my site SamWebsterHarris.com.If you enjoyed this then that makes me very happy. If you didn‚Äôt enjoy this I‚Äôm not sure why you are still reading, life is rather short, go and read something else.",30/05/2019,4,0,32,11,682,451,24,3,0,8,146
Reinventing Personalization For Customer Experience,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/reinventing-personalization-for-customer-experience-235d8c75aa38,Atif M.,254,6,1363,"‚ÄúRemember that a person‚Äôs name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.‚Äù ‚Äî Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence PeopleWhen it comes to building good relationships with customers, learning their names is an essential step for businesses at any level. Consumers expect to be treated as individuals when it comes to the brands they do business with. Remembering a person‚Äôs name and using it whenever appropriate is key to winning that person over to your way of thinking. This fact is backed by science which says that hearing one‚Äôs own name has a powerful impact on the listener‚Äôs brain. Hence, it is only logical to remember and use not only the customers‚Äô names, but also their likes and dislikes to make them feel valued ‚Äî in other words, providing consumers with a personalized customer experience can change them into brand loyalists in no time.The age of the customer marked the end of the one-size-fits-all messaging era. Today, a single message can‚Äôt get the job done unless it‚Äôs perfectly tailored to relate with every customer. This is the age where consumers are more empowered than ever before and in control of their relationship with a brand. These consumers continually demand personalization throughout the buying journey.Living in a noisy world of instant gratification, how can a business make an impression in an already overcrowded field? It‚Äôs simple actually ‚Äî by making use of something known as the ‚Äúcocktail party‚Äù effect. Here‚Äôs how cocktail party effect works: when you‚Äôre at a cocktail party with dozens of people chattering around you, you‚Äôll find that you can easily blur out those conversations. To you, they‚Äôre just background noise. But, as soon as someone says your name or something that is of particular interest to you, your ears perk up and tune into that specific conversation. This information will rise above the noise because it is important to you.Similarly, adding a personal touch to the customer experience, for instance, using dynamic recipient name tags in emails can enable businesses to get their voice heard, allowing them to stand out in an overcrowded market.Companies can no longer rely on their products and services as their primary competitive differentiator; today, they can only compete based on delivering an outstanding experience.According to Janrain 48% of consumers spend more when their experience is personalized while 74% of people hate being shown irrelevant content. So what does this say about personalization? In customer experience, personalization is a winning strategy that can help companies advance their relationship with the customers. 88% of marketers claim that they‚Äôve seen a measurable improvement in their businesses after implementing customer experience personalization tactics.However, only 33% of businesses feel confident about the tools they possess to personalize customer experience appropriately. So instead of getting discouraged by this fact, how can companies leverage digital transformation to win the customer experience race?This guide here can help businesses create a more personalized experience for their customers regardless of their current situation stands.One of the essential ingredients for creating the perfect personalization formula is accurate and complete information. To get access to this information, it is crucial for a business to encourage their customers to create user profiles on their platform. Customers are perfectly happy to allow companies to track their behavior as long as it is only used to enhance their experience. Customers now expect companies to monitor their behavior through their profiles as more than half of them have admitted that they expect brands to anticipate their needs so they can receive relevant suggestions. So, customers of this age want companies to:It is estimated that up to 35% of Amazon purchases come from recommendations according to consulting firm McKinsey. The Netflix mantra on personalization nicely sums up the importance from the customer perspective: Personalization = Maximize enjoyment + Minimize search time.Remember, the best way to motivate a customer to make a profile is to make the process super easy ‚Äî no need to have hundreds of irrelevant fields in a sign-up form.2. Segmentation is the key to successWhether a business is collecting emails or creating ads on social media, segmentation is the key. For emails, it is crucial to segment email subscribers, so only relevant content is sent to each subscriber. Although everyone who signed up for a company‚Äôs newsletter might be interested in the brand, it does not necessarily mean that they have the same needs. For instance, a 50% flat off on women‚Äôs wear would have nothing to do with a male email recipient; for him, it is plain spam to him, and nobody likes to be spammed. So grouping or segmenting the subscribers into separate lists can help ensure that nobody is ‚Äòspammed.‚ÄôSimilarly, segmenting the audience can help a business target potential customers through ads.3. Save information for future ‚Äî using cloud-based technology for personalizationAgain, user profiles are of utmost importance here. Companies need to make sure that they ask for relevant information to complete a purchase only once. After that, the information can be stored to accelerate the future purchasing process via any channel, on any device, at any time.4. Implementing geotargeting practicesA customer‚Äôs location can be useful in several ways to enhance the customer experience for all potential customers from the same region. For example, a company can offer a tailored CX to their website visitors by allowing them to choose their country. So if it‚Äôs a retail e-store, people in Pakistan will see measurements in the metric system, while people in the United States will see them in USCS. The location information can also be used in other ways like sending offers associated with weather or special occasions to the email subscribers.5. Listen to customer feedbackAll great companies put their customers first. According to research, 68% of consumers abandon a business because they feel the brand does not care about them.Asking customers for feedback is right, listening to it is better, but implementing changes just for the sake of it is not such a great idea when that won‚Äôt deliver an ROI. However, if a large percentage of customers give similar feedback, it is wise to implement changes to improve not only a process but also the customer-brand relationship.6. Allow customers to be a part of the personalization processA blend of an interactive process with a personalization strategy can help create an unforgettable experience for customers. Even if some customers don‚Äôt have a profile, a business can still provide them with superior personalized experience using interactive tools. An excellent example of such a feature is a virtual ‚ÄòTry It On‚Äô feature by Maybelline which allows people to virtually try on makeup products before making a purchase.7. Don‚Äôt be formal all the timeIt‚Äôs always good to keep things formal but being formal often makes it difficult for brands to connect with people. To establish a personal relationship with customers, it‚Äôs extremely important to use the first-word perspective when writing content. By doing this, a brand enables its customers to feel more comfortable as if they‚Äôre talking to a friend.8. Personalize emailsPersonalizing the email content is just as important as segmenting email lists. Crafting the perfect subject line is the first step to a successful email marketing strategy. After all, if no one opens up that email, it‚Äôs probably spam. Here at Inqline, we use email as a channel to deliver our personalized and thoughtful responses to customers, which helps improve the customer experience. We encourage our team to use the customer‚Äôs name, as well as empathetic words and writing styles so that we create a sense of camaraderie while remaining professional. One good example of this could be of the time when one of our customers sent their concern to us as a song, and so we replied with a song, creating a memorable customer experience for him.We know that customers are quickly transforming into smart buyers, which makes the customer experience the only competitive differentiator among brands. Faced with fierce competition, brands are continually looking into different strategies to keep customers loyal and engaged. When executed correctly, personalization of the customer experience can be one of the most sure-shot ways of gaining higher returns while making customers happy.",30/05/2019,2,0,8,3,,,2,2,0,4,569
Which 2020 Candidate is the Best at Twitter?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/which-2020-candidate-is-the-best-at-twitter-fd083d13fb4e,Michael Tauberg,1100,8,1291,"The contest for the 2020 Democratic party nomination will be fought in many arenas. Before the first debates in a month, before the campaign rallies in key states, and even before prime time TV interviews, the fight for the nomination has begun on Twitter. Each of the major Democratic candidates has a signifiant social media following. With these accounts, the candidates have the means to directly communicate to voters, the media, and the world. After all, we‚Äôve seen that carefully crafted tweets can change narratives in the real world.Knowing this, I decided to collect all of the tweets from 11 of the top Democratic candidates for president. Three of these contenders have separate work accounts, so in total 14 profiles were analyzed. With this data, it‚Äôs possible to see which candidates make the best use of this new and powerful platform.The candidate with the most Twitter followers is definely Bernie Sanders. Between his senate (@SenSanders) and personal (@BernieSanders) accounts, Sanders has over 17 million followers. No doubt some of these overlap, but it goes to show that his 2016 campaign created a massive social media following. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs senate account is a distant third, while Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris are also followed by multiple millions of people.The follower count can best be seen as measure of the potential influence of a candidate online. The actual effectiveness of a large following depends on how good the candidate is at communicating.If a follower count is like potential energy, then the number of tweets issued is analogous to kinetic energy. In this respect, Andrew Yang is the most energetic and also the most prolific of the 2020 candidates. With almost 3000 tweets in 2019, Yang uses social media far more than his peers. He is the one contender who probably leverages this medium fully.Behind Yang, Elizabeth Warren and then Kamala Harris are the politicians who tweet the most. Far behind these is the leader in the polls, Joe Biden. Biden only has 147 tweets in 2019. In Twitter as in real life, his campaign strategy seems to be to avoid getting too much attention.If we add up all of the likes that each candidate got on Twitter in 2019, Kamala Harris comes out on top with Elizabeth Warren a distant second.However, if we plot these likes over time, we see that most of Harris‚Äô support came in February when she first announced her campaign. In contrast, Elizabeth‚Äôs Warren‚Äôs like count has been steadily increasing. This is one reason that I think Warren might have the best shot at the nomination. Her momentum is still growing.If we were to divide all those likes by the number of twitter followers that each candidate had (thus normalizing them), then we‚Äôd see that Andrew Yang and Pete Buttigieg come out on top. Among all the candidates, their followers seem to be the most engaged.Another useful measure of Twitter engagement is the ‚Äòretweet‚Äô. Retweets are what spread messages across the network and are the best indicator of a tweet‚Äôs success.The retweet plot looks almost identical to the one for likes. As with likes, we see spikes of engagement in May, and I submit that this is due to the passage of the bills limiting abortion in Alabama and Georgia. Especially among the woman candidates, these laws have provided constant Twitter fodder. Bernie Sanders has also done a good job of getting in front of this issue, while Joe Biden has not. Below is a plot of the number of tweets that contian the word ‚Äòabortion‚Äô, per candidate. Most of these tweets are from the past month.Interestingly, top candidates Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O‚Äôrourke have been largely silent on this issue. I think this is proof that men will have a hard time in the primaries this year.Beyond looking at the statistics associated with a candidate‚Äôs Tweets, we can also look at their content. Below I focus on tweet text itself, and examine the different themes that emerge.Joe Biden‚Äôs is selling himself as the anti-Trump. As such, it‚Äôs not surprising that his most popular tweet ‚Äî the most liked tweet of any candidate ‚Äî is an attack on the President.Specifically Biden‚Äôs tweets argue that he can return America to its ‚Äúcore values‚Äù. In one, he says ‚ÄúWe choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division.‚Äù In another he contrasts these values with the current President.Creating a word cloud of the most common terms in Biden‚Äôs tweets, we see common references to ‚Äúcountry‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù, and the ‚Äúnation‚Äù. His campaign seems fueled by vague promises to return things to a better past.Bernie Sanders is a firebrand both on and off social media. His most popular tweets tend to pick fights with Republicans, whether over abortion or Ilhan Omar.Bernie also talks about the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù, but through the lens of its ‚Äòpeople‚Äô rather than its values. In fact, ‚Äòpeople‚Äô is the most common word used in his tweets. The other key word he uses is ‚Äòhealth‚Äô and healthcare seems to be the main issue in his campaign.Elizabeth Warren is among the more in-depth storytellers on Twitter. Her top 3 missives in 2019 are all long and detailed. They tackle issues ranging from violence against women (Ilhan Omar) and inequality (wealth tax) to abortion. In the latter case, she is particularly compelling, explaining why the laws in Georgie and Alabama are so harmful.Like Bernie Sanders, she focusses on the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô, but with a greater emphasis on the ‚Äòfight‚Äô for them. She also focusses more on ‚Äòfamilies‚Äô than Sanders does.Like Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris has also made abortion and attacks on Trump key planks of her campaign. Her most popular tweets reflect this.For me though, Harris doesn't seem at ease online. Although she hits the important themes of ‚Äòhealth‚Äô, ‚Äòpeople‚Äô, and ‚Äòfamilies‚Äô, Harris‚Äô tweets tend to be simple and somewhat lacking in emotion. I suspect her background as an attorney makes her too careful with her words. Her most commonly used words are classic calls to action‚Äî ‚Äúmust‚Äù and ‚Äúwill‚Äù.Pete Buttigieg tweets less often than his opponents, but when he does, he is very effective. His most popular tweets are a mix of outrage and fun stories ‚Äî a dynamite combination on social media.More than anything, Buttigieg‚Äôs Twitter persona reflects that of a nice guy. For instance, he seems to use the word ‚Äòthanks‚Äô a lot. Buttigieg is also a sort of anti-Trump, but one with less baggage than Biden and less ideology than Bernie (see his emphasis on ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô instead of ‚Äòworkers‚Äô). His word cloud is below.One of the easiest ways to measure the content of candidate‚Äôs tweets is to calculate how positive they are. Using the sentimentR library, I was able to compare the average sentiment of the candidates tweets.As I‚Äôve noted before, Andrew Yang is the most positive of all the 2020 candidates. Beto O‚ÄôRourke and Pete Buttigieg also tend to use a positive tone when communicating on social media. In contrast, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders are more likely to use negative language. Finally, Joe Biden strikes a mostly positive tone, but one which is less optimistic that Buttigieg. This seems about right to me. Twitter sentiment seems to reflects the general mood associated with each campaign.I personally think that in the age of social media, winning elections also means communicating well on the internet. In this respect, we see that the candidates all have different strengths. Bernie Sanders has the most followers and thus the most grassroots support. Kamala Harris has the most likes and maybe the most institutional backing. Elizabeth Warren has the most momentum, and Joe Biden has the greatest ability to draw attention with his name recognition. Come 2020, we‚Äôll see which candidate presses these advantages most effectively.",30/05/2019,2,0,6,1,,,25,0,0,7,188
How data management practice enables the successful implementation of a single customer view?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-data-management-practice-enables-a-successful-implementation-of-single-customer-view-part-1-f9f508bddc85,Ben Chan,15,4,710,"A single customer view is a centralized location that consolidates all the knowable data and information of your customers within your organization and enables you to view, find, and understand every aspect of your customers. Having a single view of customers within your environment helps you understand what and how your customers purchase. These intelligence servers as fuel to your sales and marketing team‚Äôs formulation and development of strategy.Extraction, consolidation, and integration are what you need on the face of it. The implementation and the solution of it are not straightforward at all, though. Customer interaction with your services or/and products can be long, stretching across multiple online and offline channels and touchpoints. Managing, governing, consolidating, and transforming valuable data and information with a tremendous variety across different channels and touchpoints is very much challenging.Reviewing the end-to-end process and mechanics of building a single customer view reveals what elements of data management practice help solve the challenges.Step 1 Extraction: extraction of all the knowable data of your customers from different systems by similar column names, by documentation from business analysts, and by knowledge from system analysts. ButA. what knowable customer data do you have in your organization?B. how do you know which system(s) to extract the customer data that you search for?Elements: Data Dictionary, Enterprise Data Flow, Data LineageStep 2 Data Cleansing: removal of all the noises of your customer data by rules provided by IT. ButA. when encountering 2 similar customer names in 2 systems, how do you know they are different or identical?B. what are the rules that most of the stakeholders are comfortable with, if not all, can be applied to clean your data, rather than you coming up with your own rules?Elements: Business Rules and Data Quality ManagementStep 3 & 4 Integration and Loading: integration of the customer data from different sources and loading it into a centralized place by using some soiled documentation and data models across different departments and I.T. ButA. what is the keys (first and last name? ID? Birthday?) you should use to merge join records from different tables or even from different systems?B. how do you structure integrated data into a centralized location so that other applications can consume it conveniently and efficiently?Element: Data Modelling, Data ArchitectureIt will be too long to cover the details of each of the elements in this post. I will try to explain it as much as I can here.Data Dictionary, or Data LineageWe don‚Äôt want to get into the academic details of each of the elements. If you are interested, Data Management Association (DAMA) has a rigorous set of definitions for it. Data dictionaries or Data Lineage are basically documents of your current state of data, systems, and their interrelated relation. If your organization has it well-managed, updated, and trusted, opening this document up, you know where to look for, for what you are looking for.Business Rules and Data Quality ManagementBusiness Rules and Data Quality are one of the most intriguing topics in Data Management. It basically a set of rules and processes to resolve data-related issues. It could be any issues. Some forks think IT (data analysts, data scientists, in-house developers, or external consultants) should develop the rules for solving data conflicts. In fact, IT is not the entity that creates data and uses data, at least on an operational level. Rather, they are the entity that develops systems for users to create and use data. They might be able to guess the rules but they cannot solve most of the data-related problems by themselves because they are not the one who creates and uses it. That‚Äôs why logically, businesses (people who create data and use data on an operational level) should be involved and consulted at least.Data Modeling and Data ArchitectureIt is more like a blueprint of your data. To build a house and buy and take some furniture and then put them into your house, you have to have a blueprint (how you design and structure your place). Data Architecture servers this purpose.I will have separate articles explaining each of the elements in isolation. But until this point, we should have grasped the idea of the difficulty of implementing a single customer view and of how data management helps solve the challenges.",30/05/2019,0,0,20,6,1050,1155,2,0,0,0,52
"Buyers beware, fake product reviews are plaguing the internet. How Machine Learning can help to spot them.",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/buyers-beware-fake-product-reviews-are-plaguing-the-internet-cfc599c42b6b,Jorge Lopez,46,5,714,"Opinion spamming is a situation that is aggravating, for instance, CBS News reports that 52% of product reviews posted in Walmart.com are ‚Äúinauthentic or unreliable‚Äù, while at least 30% of reviews posted at Amazon are fake. The problem of identifying opinion spamming remains an open topic, despite the fact that several researchers have addressed it already.What makes businesses to incur in product deceptive reviews? The main driver is getting ahead of the competition for positioning their product or service to influence the public and organizations to make a purchase, therefore increasing their sales. The fraud takes place by posting fake negative reviews and giving unjust ratings to products from the competition.It is known that ‚ÄúAmazon Mechanical Turk‚Äù, an internet crowdsourcing marketplace that allows requesters (businesses or individuals) to coordinate human labor to carry out a task, was employed to crowdsource fake reviews for a hotel chain. Given that this problem has grown to alarming rates, Yelp.com, a business directory service that publishes crowd-sourced reviews about businesses, launched a sting operation in order to unmask those businesses who buy fake reviews.I will discuss the method that Mukherjee et al. present in their paper for detecting spam in product reviews. They called their model ‚ÄúAuthor Spamicity Model‚Äù (ASM). It is based on unsupervised learning which models spamicity as latent, shortly meaning that the model variables are ‚Äúhidden‚Äù. It is also a Bayesian inference framework. The aim of the model is to cluster the categorization of this latent population distributions into spammers and not spammers.Please note that when I refer to products, I will be including also services.How can we identify that a review may be fake? In order to develop their model, the authors define nine variables as observed features, the first five they categorize them as author features that have values in the interval [0, 1] (denoting a Beta distribution), where a value close to 0 or 1 denotes non-spamming or spamming, respectively. In the other hand, variables 5 to 9, represent review features, and they assume a binary value, 0 for non-spamming, and 1 for spamming (denoting a Bernoulli distribution):How does ASM work? In order to illustrate the model, I have simplified its functioning in the following schema (See Figures 1-A and 1-B), for a mathematical representation please refer to the paper.ASM commences by taking in all the reviews by all the authors, where these reviews are organized by the features that we have discussed. Each sphere represents an observable variable (i.e. feature). Once the features are collected (See Figure 1-A node A) they are processed by the model and learn the ‚Äúlatent behavior distributions for spam and not spam‚Äù (Murkherjee et al.). Therefore, ASM solves a clustering problem (K = 2).The spamicity is modeled as latent as ASM functions in the Bayesian context. It is a generative process because it emits the nine features with their probability of spamming.In order to perform an inference, the model uses ‚ÄúCollapsed Gibbs Sampling‚Äù (CGS) that represents a technique for approximating the posterior probability distribution. CGS belongs to the family of algorithms of Markov Chain Montecarlo.Once the ranking functions have been inferred, they are processed using the Learning to Rank supervised technique, that basically takes the rankings obtained by ASM and generates a single aggregated ranking function (see Figure 1-A node C).In my opinion, this paper presents a technique that can improve significantly the detection of opinion spammers in product reviews. It is innovative because presents an unsupervised method for detecting fake reviews. The authors claim having achieved a superior level of accuracy compared to strong competitors. I believe that opinion spamming will start to decrease as more businesses providing this type of information start to implement ML techniques like ASM, meanwhile consumers must be skeptical and get informed using sites that filter fake reviews.A Mukherjee, A Kumar, B Liu, J Wang, M Hsu‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Proceedings of the 19th ‚Ä¶, 2013 ‚Äî dl.acm.orgP Resnik, E Hardisty ‚Äî 2010GEP Box, GC Tiao ‚Äî 2011 ‚Äî books.google.comby JA L√≥pez ‚Äî ‚Äé2017www.cbsnews.com‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî -Dear reader, I am interested to know from you:Thanks for participating, you can leave a comment to respond.",30/05/2019,3,0,13,10,877,548,2,2,0,18,335
Ideas: Design Methodologies for Data Sprints,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/ideas-design-methodologies-for-data-sprints-9d10a32090e4,Anne Gibbon,323,8,1705,"I recently spent four days at a research lab with a group of data scientists and a few behavior scientists diving into a large, messy data set to see if we might find insights related to group dynamics. It was framed as an initial dive to look around, get an initial assessment of potential for useful research insights, and then build a proposal for two to three months of work based on what was found that week.I attended theoretically in the role of a behavioral scientist, but since I‚Äôm also obsessed with creative problem solving processes, or design thinking (and I‚Äôm opinionated as hell), the following are some reflections on the process we used and ideas for what‚Äôs next.A lot of process methodologies occupy the space in the overlap between software development, data analytics, and creative problem solving disciplines: UX, design thinking, Think Wrong, Google Design Sprint, Agile, Kanban, emerging data analysis methods for group sprints, etc. It‚Äôs great, because if you‚Äôre curious you can acquire a pretty big toolset to bring together groups of people to crash and get creative on all different kinds of problems for widely varying lengths in time ‚Äî a two hour meeting to an 18 month project. The challenge, or mastery of practice as a facilitator, is to learn not just the buzz words of the methodologies or the exercises themselves, but the underlying science behind group dynamics, creativity, psychology, and neuroscience.During this workshop, we had a two distinct types of professionals in the room ‚Äî social science and data science, each with complementary skillsets within those groupings. They were all brand new to the data set, and it was pretty messy when we first looked at it. The direction from the sprint‚Äôs sponsor was extremely broad ‚Äî what general insights about the group dynamics of these co-workers can be identified in a three day sprint.Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt clearly identify the direction for what kind of insights would be most useful until the afternoon of the second day. At that point, the social science group separated to brainstorm a range of different questions that could be asked about group dynamics, and which theories and research questions were emerging as especially intriguing for the field. Besides ensuring the whole team had a clear idea of the direction for the workshop and what question themes regarding group dynamics would be most useful (ie. performance of small work teams, changes in group composition over time, looking for patterns in the kinds of people who grouped together, etc) we also needed design constraints, but didn‚Äôt identify them. Intro design thinking uses a generic Venn diagram to illustrate the criteria a design must successfully meet in order to be green lit for funding/ effort to develop a high-fidelity solution. Companies develop their own specific criteria that usually fall somewhere into these buckets. Without identifying our own, the team relied on the expertise and gut instinct of the people gathered in the room. Not bad ‚Äî everyone was incredibly smart and knew their field well; but not great if you want to maximize resources toward understanding the most important/ impactful questions.Our facilitator took the route of using UX and design thinking exercises ‚Äî personas and needs statements ‚Äî over the first two days. They were meant to get the group to identify specific questions that could then be voted on by the whole team. On the third day, small groups broke off, each taking one or two questions that might be asked of the data. Normally personas and needs statements are an incredibly reliable method; they work in all kinds of situations. But during this sprint many people found them to be frustrating when they had been told to look for insights about group dynamics, not individual personas.The first challenge with persona methods is that they are designed to be used with deliberative modes of thinking, or System 2 (from Thinking Fast and Slow) that take a diverse, seemingly disconnected array of information ‚Äî most often qualitative ethnography ‚Äî and synthesize it to come to some detailed statement of need. With no prior set of information about the people in the data set, we were left looking at spreadsheets of raw data and making up cartoon characters as personas. The whole team went along gamely and tried to make use of it, but the time could have been better spent.The second challenge regarding the selection of persona methods is that they are meant to be used during design processes where the outcome is some product or service serving archetypal individuals. There is a relationship between problem for the persona, and solution ‚Äî solving a need of the persona. For this workshop, our team was not meant to produce a product or service, the insights were the deliverables. Rather than personas, we should have been exploring and mapping the space of the complex concept of group dynamics.The somewhat awkward use of some design thinking/ UX methods and rejection of others for this workshop was totally understandable. As design sprints have become a popular, justifiably so, tool for businesses to bring multi-disciplinary teams together and develop novel concepts and products, the broad space of design and software development methodologies have edged into unfamiliar territory ‚Äî data analytics. While I feel experienced to comment on design methodologies, data science is new territory for me. From the literature review I‚Äôve done, and the limited commercial experience with analytics teams, it seems that they are themselves wrestling with what methodologies serve group data sprints best. Analysis has traditionally been done solo, or sitting side by side, not requiring a more formal group process. Three forces are pushing data scientists to develop group analytics methodologies: the data science field has bifurcated with an ever increasing number of specializations and tools, the sheer amount of data has exponentially increased, and data science is spreading to disciplines that had previously done their analysis with almost ubiquitous qualitative methods and tools ‚Äî so multi-disciplinary teams were becoming the norm. In the last five to seven years, there have been several academic articles and blogs describing group data analysis processes.My PhD research involves developing a co-design process to analyze a complex concept ‚Äî wellbeing, using 3D data visualization software. I‚Äôve been thinking about how we bring groups together to investigate and communicate about complex concepts, the very early work of group and individual need finding in order to eventually do policy, service, and product design. Trying to grasp complex systems and complex concepts is a totally different beast than even synthesizing nuanced psychological and social needs from personas. Oral cultures have very different approaches to thinking about and discussing complexity, and I believe our western dominated, literate, tech cultures have a lot to learn from them about how to analyze complexity.I would like to offer these ideas for multi-disciplinary groups working to identify insights in large, messy data sets. I‚Äôm curious what others are doing, and would love some feedback.First, here is the framework I use to organize design sprints organized around addressing particular needs of particular archetypal personas. Four quadrants correspond to the four phases usually associated with design thinking: interviewing and observing users, synthesis of needs, ideation, and prototyping and testing. I find that it helps me as a facilitator to understand the modes of thinking I‚Äôm trying to induce my participants to exercise for different methods. It‚Äôs also helpful to pair the mode of thinking with a clear delineation between problem and solution. Trying to brainstorm about both the problem and solution at the same time is a recipe for a chaotic descent of the group way, way off track. This 2x2 framework is most useful when designing exercises for workshops that revolve around understanding a user‚Äôs need and developing some thing to solve it ‚Äî a software product interface, a household object, a social service.Complexity, ie group dynamics, requires a different framework for thinking about which methods to select and which modes of thinking to use during a sprint. In our sprint, the work revolved around getting to an insight, refining a raw data set and teasing apart a complex topic. Using a 2x2 matrix again, complex concept and raw data set replace problem and solution on one of the axes. For the second axis, we might use different flare and focus modes than ones that serve thinking about defined needs of individual archetypes, two examples would be inductive/ deductive and declarative/ modal. Dr. Mihnea Moldoveanu of Rottman Business School, led a decade long research effort to understand the modes of thinking, or adaptive intelligence, that transcends discipline boundaries. His admonishment is essentially to consciously select the mode of thinking, or pattern of thinking modes, best fit for the problem and group of people at hand.A hypothetical set of methods for another data sprint might go: 1) map the scales, layers, and theories related to the complex concept in question, 2) down select to the most important set of themes or meta-questions to ask of the data set, 3) exploratory analysis of the raw data set, 4) develop a schema and begin cleaning the data and organizing it into an easy to access data frame, 5) break up into small groups to each tackle a theme or meta-question and use alternating flare and focus modes of thinking like inductive/ deductive and declarative/ modal to iteratively analyze the data, develop hypothetical insights, and refine them with more data analysis.This space of methodologies ‚Äî especially sprint methodologies ‚Äî to ask complex questions of big data sets using multidisciplinary teams is really exciting. So many of the most interesting questions facing our policy-makers, scientists, and researchers sit on huge piles of data at the intersection of fields that traditionally haven‚Äôt had to find a common language to work together. Facilitators, data scientists, and design practitioners might develop new theories on how best best to organize teams to more quickly and efficiently divine insights from large, chaotic data sets. Inevitably, someone will try to come along and commoditize it with pretty graphic icons and simplified descriptions. But right now it‚Äôs a fun, collaborative space of community exploration as we figure out how to bring more disciplines and professions together with data scientists and raw data.",30/05/2019,1,0,0,1,1020,893,5,1,0,9,75

Wine Embeddings and a Wine Recommender,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/robosomm-chapter-3-wine-embeddings-and-a-wine-recommender-9fc678f1041e,Roald Schuring,78,10,1943,"One of the cornerstones of previous chapters of the RoboSomm series has been to extract descriptors from professional wine reviews, and to convert these into quantitative features. In this article, we will explore a way of extracting features from wine reviews that combines the best of the existing RoboSomm series and academic literature on this topic. We will then use these features to produce a simple wine recommendation engine.The Jupyter Notebook with all relevant code can be found in this Github repository. Our dataset consists of roughly 180,000 professional wine reviews, scraped from www.winemag.com. These reviews span roughly 20 years, dozens of countries and hundreds of grape varieties.In the following section, we walk through the five steps required to create our ‚Äòwine embeddings‚Äô: a 300-dimensional vector for each wine, summarizing its sensory profile. On the way, we will explain successful approaches others have taken in similar projects. Before we proceed, let‚Äôs pick a wine to join us on this journey:Review: Dried red flowers and sagebrush combine for an elegant aromatic entry to this bottling by two business partners who have worked in Santa Barbara‚Äôs restaurant scene for many years. Tarragon and intriguing peppercorn flavors decorate the tangy cranberry palate, which is lightly bodied but very well structured.Excellent! Time to get stuck in.Step 1: Normalize words in wine review (remove stopwords, punctuation, stemming)The first step is to normalize our text. We want to remove stopwords and any punctuation from our raw text. In addition, we will use a stemmer (Snowball Stemmer in Sci-Kit Learn) to reduce inflected words to their stem. The Pinot review becomes the following:dri red flower sagebrush combin eleg aromat entri bottl two bus partner work santa barbara restaur scene mani year tarragon intrigu peppercorn flavor decor tangi cranberri palat light_bodi veri well structurStep 2: Enhance the set of normalized words with phrases (bi-grams and tri-grams)Next, we want to account for the possibility that some of the terms we want to extract from the wine descriptions are actually combinations of words or phrases. Here, we can use the gensim package Phrases to produce a set of bi- and tri-grams for the full corpus. Running our normalized wine review through the phraser consolidates terms such as ‚Äòlight‚Äô and ‚Äòbodi‚Äô which are frequently found next to each other to ‚Äòlight_bodi‚Äô:dri red flower sagebrush combin eleg aromat entri bottl two bus partner work santa_barbara restaur scene mani_year tarragon intrigu peppercorn flavor decor tangi cranberri palat light_bodi veri well structurStep 3: Use the RoboSomm wine wheels to standardize the wine descriptors in each reviewWine reviewers are often creative in their use of language, and sometimes use different words to describe things that are seemingly the same. After all, are ‚Äòwet slate‚Äô, ‚Äòwet stone‚Äô and ‚Äòwet cement‚Äô aromas not really manifestations of the same sensory experience? In addition, wine tasting has specific jargon. Terms such as ‚Äòbaked‚Äô, ‚Äòhot‚Äô or ‚Äòpolished‚Äô have a specific meaning in the world of wine tasting.To standardize wine jargon and creative descriptors, researchers such as Bernard Chen have developed the Computational Wine Wheel. The Computational Wine Wheel categorizes and maps various wine terms that appear in wine reviews to create a consolidated set of descriptors. This great work, together with the contributions of others (e.g. Wine Folly and UC Davis) has been used to generate the RoboSomm wine wheels. These wine wheels were created by looking at a list of the most frequently occurring descriptors in the corpus after going through steps 1 and 2 outlined above. This list was then reviewed manually, and mapped onto a set of standardized descriptors. In total, this resulted in a mapping for over 1,000 ‚Äòraw‚Äô descriptors.The first of the RoboSomm wine wheels is an aroma wheel, that categorizes a variety of aromatic descriptors:The second wine wheel is a non-aroma wheel, that accounts for other characteristics, such as body, sweetness and acid levels. These descriptors are not typically included in tasting wheels, but are prominent parts of a tasting experience:We can choose to standardize wine terms at any of the three levels of the wheel, or use the raw descriptor itself (no standardization). For now, we will map the descriptors to the outside layer of the wheel. For the Pinot Noir review we started processing, we obtain the following:dry red flower sagebrush combin elegant aromat entri bottl two bus partner work santa_barbara restaur scene mani_year tarragon intrigu pepper flavor decor tangy cranberry palat light_bodied veri well structurNote that all the descriptors that have been mapped are highlighted in bold. The other terms are either non-informative or ambiguous in the context of this analysis.Step 4: Retrieve the Word2Vec word embedding for each mapped term in the reviewNext, we need to consider how we will quantify our set of mapped descriptors. A common approach to doing this (and one that was used in previous chapters of the RoboSomm series!) is to represent the absence/presence of each descriptor in the corpus with a 0 or a 1. However, this approach does not take into account semantic (dis)similarities between terms. Tarragon, for instance, is more similar to sagebrush than it is to cranberry. To account for this, we can create word embeddings: vector representations of words and phrases. Researchers such as Els Lefever and her co-authors have taken a similar approach to quantifying wine reviews in their work.For the purpose of this project, we will use a technique called Word2Vec to generate a 300-dimensional embedding for every mapped term. Since wine jargon is so specific, we have to train our Word2Vec model on a representative corpus. Fortunately, our set of 180,000 wine reviews is exactly that! Having previously mapped our descriptors using our wine wheels, we have already somewhat standardized the wine terms in our corpus. This was done to eliminate unnecessary semantic nuance (e.g. consolidate ‚Äòwet stone‚Äô, ‚Äòwet slate‚Äô and ‚Äòwet cement‚Äô to ‚Äòwet rock‚Äô), hopefully enhancing the quality of our Word2Vec model.Our trained Word2Vec model consists of a 300-dimensional embedding for every term in our corpus. However, we can recall from the previous step in this analysis that we only really care about the terms that are relevant descriptors of a wine‚Äôs sensory experience.For our Pinot Noir, these were:dry, flower, sagebrush, elegant, tarragon, pepper, tangy, cranberry, light_bodiedIn the adjacent image, we can see the word embedding for each of these mapped descriptors.Step 5: Weight each word embedding in the wine review with a TF-IDF weighting, and sum the word embeddings togetherNow that we have a word embedding for each mapped descriptor, we need to think about how we can combine these into a single vector. Looking at our Pinot Noir example, ‚Äòdry‚Äô is a fairly common descriptor across all wine reviews. We want to weight that less than a rarer, more distinctive descriptor such as ‚Äòsagebrush‚Äô. In addition, we want to take into consideration the total number of descriptors per review. If there are 20 descriptors in one review and five in another, each individual descriptor in the former review probably contributes less to the overall profile of the wine than in the latter. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) takes both of these factors into consideration. TF-IDF looks at how many mapped descriptors are contained within a single review (TF), as well as at how often each mapped descriptor appears in the 180,000 wine reviews (IDF).Multiplying each mapped descriptor vector by its TF-IDF weighting gives us our set of weighted mapped descriptor vectors. We can then sum these to obtain a single wine embedding for each wine review. For our Pinot Noir, this looks something like:Now that we have our wine embeddings, it‚Äôs time to have some fun. One of the things we can do is produce a wine recommender system. We can do this by using a nearest neighbors model, which calculates the cosine distance between various wine review vectors. The wine embeddings that lie closest to one another are returned as suggestions.Let‚Äôs take a look at what we get as suggestions when we insert our Point & Line Pinot Noir from earlier. Which of the 180,000 possible wines in our dataset are returned as suggestions?The top three wines returned are all Pinot Noirs from California. Looking at the descriptors for these wines, we can see that they are indeed very similar to our original wine. Cranberry features in every one of the suggestions. Because of the way the wine embeddings have been constructed, the semantic similarity of non-identical terms is also taken into consideration. For example, the word ‚Äòflower‚Äô in the original wine review is similar to ‚Äòhibiscus‚Äô and ‚Äòrose‚Äô in the first suggestion.If we look at the top ten wine suggestions for our Point & Line Pinot Noir (see this Jupyter Notebook for the full list), we can see that the recommendations are remarkably consistent. All ten wines come come from California, and nine out the ten are Pinot Noirs. Five are even produced within a 60-mile radius of our original wine. The only wine that is not a Pinot Noir is a Cabernet Franc from the Santa Ynez Valley, a mere 25-minute drive from where our Point & Line Pinot is produced. The geographical origin of our Pinot Noir wine appears to have a very strong effect on its sensory profile, allowing for it to be matched with other similar wines in its direct vicinity. The adjacent map illustrates just how geographically concentrated our wine recommendations are.The remarkable performance of this recommender model does beg the question: how is it possible that the suggestions returned are so specific to a single geographical area?At its core, this analysis is entirely dependent on the wine reviews used to construct the wine embeddings. In this post, a taster for the Wine Enthusiast explains how wines are rated on the www.winemag.com website. Although ratings are given through a process of blind tasting, it is not entirely clear whether the text description in the review is also a product of an unbiased evaluation process. It is possible that reviewers, having seen the bottle, consciously or unconsciously attribute certain terms to specific types of wine (e.g. ‚Äòsagebrush‚Äô for Pinot Noirs from Southern California).On the other hand, it is also entirely possible that these wines truly exhibit sensory profiles that can be attributed to specific grape varieties, terroirs and wine-making styles. The professional reviewers from the Wine Enthusiast may well have such finely-tuned palates that they can pick out these nuances in each wine, without having seen the bottle.Using Descriptors to Suggest WinesAs a final exercise, we can take a slightly different approach to leveraging our wine recommender. Let‚Äôs say that we are looking for a wine with specific characteristics. On a hot summer‚Äôs day, we might feel like a wine that is fresh, high in acid, and has aromas of grapefruit, grass and lime. Taking the RoboSomm wine wheels for a spin, we can pick the descriptors that match these characteristics: ‚Äòfresh‚Äô, ‚Äòhigh_acid‚Äô, ‚Äògrapefruit‚Äô, ‚Äògrass‚Äô and ‚Äòlime‚Äô.Feeding these descriptors into the wine recommender, we get the following suggestions:All three of the wine recommendations are Chilean Sauvignon Blancs, with two coming from the Leyda Valley. Once again, it is noteworthy how geographically concentrated the suggestions are. Especially considering that the wine recommender has 180,000 different wines to choose from!There is no shortage of ways in which we can use our wine embeddings. Our simple wine recommender model suggests that it may be worth further investigating wine styles through the lens of geography. What is the influence of terroir vs. wine-making style? Do geographical differences establish themselves in the same ways for different grape varieties? Perhaps we can also learn more about the process by which wine reviews are written and the extent to which biases drive the use of certain descriptors.",30/05/2019,0,2,25,20,690,553,6,0,0,10,45
Faster Training for Efficient CNNs,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-training-of-efficient-cnns-657953aa080,Sachin Mehta,33,3,289,"Recently, it has been shown that depth-wise convolutions are very effective in designing efficient networks, such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet. However, such efficient networks take longer to train, usually 300 ‚Äì 400 epochs, to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.In this article, we describe an effective learning rate scheduler introduced in the ESPNetv2 paper (CVPR‚Äô19) that allows training efficient networks in about 100 epochs without having any significant impact on the accuracy. To demonstrate the superior performance of the learning rate scheduler in ESPNetv2, we use ShuffleNetv2's architecture in this post. We note that our findings are consistent with other efficient networks, including MobileNetv2.ESPNetv2 introduces a variant of the cosine learning rate, wherein the learning rate is decayed linearly until cycle length and then restarted. At each epoch t, the learning rate Œ∑‚Çú is computed as:With the learning rate scheduler described above, we train ShuffleNetv2 for a total of 120 epochs with a batch size of 512 across four TitanX GPUs using SGD with momentum at two different FLOP settings: (1) 41 MFLOPs and (2) 146 MFLOPs. For the first 60 epochs, we set Œ∑‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô, Œ∑‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì, and T to 0.1, 0.5, and 5, respectively. For the remaining 60 epochs, we set Œ∑‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì=0.1, T=60, and Œ∑‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô=Œ∑‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì/T. The figure below visualizes the learning policy for 120 epochs.Results are given in Figure 3 and Table 1. We can clearly see that the learning rate scheduler (discussed above) enables faster training while delivering similar performance as the linear learning rate scheduler in ShuffleNet paper.Yes, the scheduler is generic and can be used across different tasks. In the ESPNetv2 paper, we used it for all three standard vision tasks: (1) image classification, (2) object detection, and (3) semantic segmentation.

Objects of Desire: A conversation with Edgar Yau,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/objects-of-desire-a-talk-on-40-gigabytes-of-4chan-pol-r-braincels-and-r-theredpill-a4f4e36a4fad,Andrew Thompson,125,19,4625,"Links to datasets are available on Components, where this story was originally published.Edgar Yau is a linguistics undergraduate student at the University of Rochester. He spent his adolescence as a member of online right-wing communities, and is now researching and writing about the language and behaviour of men in these spaces.For the uninitiated, a brief bestiary:4chan is an anarchic (not to be confused with anarchist) message board whose subforums range in topic from gaming to the outdoors to hentai. 4chan/pol, the ‚ÄúPolitically Incorrect‚Äù subforum, is 4chan‚Äôs politics board and one of the most active alt-right spaces online.‚ÄúRed pill‚Äù is a term of various usage that functions as the alt-right counterpart to wokeness, referring to everything from the acceptance of the inevitable collapse of democracy and the welfare state (as in Nick Land‚Äôs ‚ÄúDark Enlightenment‚Äù), ‚Äúrace realism‚Äù, and-in its most popularly understood usage due to its association with the subreddit r/TheRedPill-a belief in the manipulability of female psychology that unlocks sexual bonanza.‚ÄúBlack pill‚Äù is a more recent coinage used in similar revelatory contexts, but in discourse about sex, it specifically refers to a more nihilistic worldview than the red pill. Whereas sexual red pillers believe that women are effectively hackable, black pillers maintain a genetic reductionism, arguing that any and all limits on one‚Äôs satisfaction in life is an absolute function of physical attractiveness, only slightly mutable via plastic surgery. Members on r/Braincels, the popular incel (involuntary celibate) subreddit, commonly refer to the black pill.Edgar Yau: It‚Äôs been about three, four years since I‚Äôve actually been a part of these communities. Now I‚Äôm more of an observer, but I‚Äôve stayed really up-to-date with the controversies and the outrage that goes on in them. In middle school I played video games and it‚Äôs the way I connected with my friends. It‚Äôs an interesting subculture for a boy to get all caught up in. The gamerspeak is very distinctive, games are very irreverent, they just kind of say whatever and if you get offended, you‚Äôre offended and everyone makes fun of you for it.It‚Äôs not a first person shooter thing, it‚Äôs just a gamer thing. I wasn‚Äôt primarily playing first person shooters at that time, I was playing a lot of Minecraft with my friends and going on all these random servers. Even then it was like, who can build the biggest swastika? It was this whole idea of, I‚Äôm not getting offended, so if other people get offended they‚Äôre stupid, they‚Äôre vulnerable, they‚Äôre idiotic. What right do they have to control the way that I speak? The concept of freedom of speech is huge in these communities.I started researching this because I was playing Call of Duty with my friend one day online, and within two minutes I heard a prepubescent voice say the n-word. I was catapulted into my adolescent years.Andrew Thompson: Angela Nagle talked about this in Kill All Normies where she discusses the idea of extending cultural capital into subcultural capital. The distinction between groups in this case is based on one‚Äôs knowledge of these very esoteric references and memes and language, like gamerspeak, and I would say also on your ability to withstand insults. If you bristle, you‚Äôre sort of being filtered out of the subculture.EY: The instant some feminist critique of games comes out, it feels like the enemy outside is coming into my space and telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt like something. There are only two options: you either double down on your opinions, or you kind of acknowledge that maybe they‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt want to say that I was too young-I was around 16-but I was probably just too certain of what I thought and how I felt that I didn‚Äôt consider just for a second that those criticisms might not be totally baseless. The interesting thing is that I‚Äôm not from here, I grew up in Hong Kong and I only came to the States for college, but I was still extremely involved in this stuff.AT: I really think of people in these subcultures expressing this fear about threats against ‚Äúthe West‚Äù. To hear that you are actually having these experiences in Hong Kong I wouldn‚Äôt have expected.EY: I went to an international school so their first language was English. It was a very Western atmosphere. Out of all my friends, I was the deepest into this stuff. I was bringing a lot of these ideas to them, especially my guy friends, and they would latch onto it. Then as I‚Äôd talk about it around my female friends they‚Äôd freak out and I‚Äôd feel vindicated. Because like, Oh, I triggered someone. I have the power to deliver this uncomfortable truth them and make them emotionally react.I can‚Äôt speak to how similar or different it was from an American high school experience, but it was certainly a very Western experience. It‚Äôs embarrassing to admit, but a lot of the guys would just say the n-word and we would get reprimanded for it. All of these moral norms in the US are the same over there. Obviously we‚Äôre consuming American pop culture, we‚Äôre watching American TV shows, we‚Äôre listening to American music. There was no connection of that word for me to race, it was just the idea that I get to use it and I can just kind of say that and trigger a reaction in people. And that‚Äôs kind of a global feeling.AT: I was talking to somebody recently who told me he was really into this stuff for a time during his adolescence. This is somebody who if you met him you would not guess in a million years that any of this materiel ever appealed to any part of him, and it did. I‚Äôm almost 33 now-this subculture as I witnessed it in my own adolescence was more or less the same. The platforms were different, I don‚Äôt think 4chan existed when I was in high school, but the texture of it was all pretty much identical in the sense of using racial slurs, maximizing offense, and being jarring in the worst possible way. I didn‚Äôt really participate in that, but my teenage rebellion certainly had a digital form. This was when we had AOL Instant Messenger. I would just find people and troll them. I was just like a little shitposter. The line dividing my own form of trolling and more outwardly hateful activity is razor thin. Between you and talking to this other person and thinking about me, and thinking about other people I know from high school, I‚Äôve realized that this transgressive online behavior is not this fringe practice that a few troubled youth drift into, this is pretty pervasive among males of a certain age to the extent that I would almost say you can assume that if you see a young male who isn‚Äôt exceedingly attractive, he is probably involved in this in some way, or is adjacent to it. It‚Äôs just the culture they default to. What the media has done is framed it as this marginal subculture when in fact, it‚Äôs actually this mainstream culture that just hasn‚Äôt been identified as such until very recently.EY: I think that‚Äôs spot on and that‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been looking into a lot, how it‚Äôs actually the norm. Often the media doesn‚Äôt treat the internet with the respect that it needs to. There‚Äôs no discussion of it with an actual understanding that these are real people and this is a serious phenomenon. I remember on CNN they were like, ‚ÄúWho is this hacker 4chan?‚Äù It reminds me of the kinds of things that I was thinking, because a lot of this is kind of a rejection of the mainstream media, mainstream ideals, partially to be edgy, but also partially because you don‚Äôt feel like it reflects or represents you.AT: There‚Äôs just more people engaging on /pol today than there were just a few years ago. So now it‚Äôs even more mainstreamed than it was and has developed a critical mass.EY: There‚Äôs almost like no meaningful, actual alternative to these monolithic places of discussion. If you go on Reddit, for example, there is still a voting system where the most popular ideas go to the top and the most controversial ideas [within a given subreddit] go away. And so if you want to express controversial ideas that don‚Äôt necessarily line up exactly with the way everyone around you is supposed to think, there‚Äôs no way to do that.The way that 4chan is laid out, it feels like you‚Äôre forced to engage with as many ideas as are thrown at you. There are conservative Reddits, but then those don‚Äôt really get as far as 4chan. And you don‚Äôt really get exposed to as many ideas that have the potential for that thrill of revelation. When you‚Äôre first starting out engaging in political ideas, you get those feelings of revelation over and over again. And it‚Äôs an interesting feeling, it feels like you‚Äôre learning. And so once you find something like Reddit, once you get a good grasp on say, if you go on r/gaming, like if you‚Äôre on the default gaming subreddit, it‚Äôs like okay, I get what these people are saying now. This is boring to me. What‚Äôs next? Oh, let‚Äôs find more and more specific, niche things. A platform like Reddit, is, I think, eventually not enough for someone who‚Äôs looking for that kind of discussion. There‚Äôs almost no alternative but 4chan to go to consistently have those provocative feelings. You don‚Äôt really see that on Reddit once you go through it.I think that that is what that‚Äôs indicative of. Not that I‚Äôm saying that people are using 4chan as a substitute for Reddit. I just think that that is a general trend, where 4chan is interesting because it‚Äôs constantly presenting you with new ideas.AT: You bring up a good point which is that it‚Äôs popular because it‚Äôs not one of these big platforms. It isn‚Äôt owned. I don‚Äôt even know who runs it. Who maintains the 4chan servers? I don‚Äôt know who the people are behind it. I think that there‚Äôs an appeal to that.I‚Äôve also been considering what Reddit is. Is it good, is it bad, what‚Äôs good, what‚Äôs bad, and so on. Reddit has basically subsumed all message boards at this point. You don‚Äôt go to message boards anymore. You go on different kinds of social media, and Reddit is the closest form of social media we have to a message board. But it doesn‚Äôt mimic message boards a lot. 4chan feels more like an old forum to me, it‚Äôs more Web 1.0 than something like Reddit is. I think that there‚Äôs no other places off these platforms to go, really. What are the other non-alt-right message boards that aren‚Äôt owned by venture capitalists?Wherever you spend your time, the more time you spend there, the more you just absorb the ideas you‚Äôre surrounded by. I find myself absorbing ideas even when I‚Äôm approaching them from a distance. Even when researching things, I can feel them trying to work on me in someway.EY: I use the word ‚ÄúChad‚Äù in conversation sometimes. The language seeps into your brain, and you start to think of things in that same framework. It‚Äôs really ridiculous.AT: The YouTuber ContraPoints did that incels video, and she actually said that just in the course of researching her video, she started using the words like Chad and Stacy. I think the reason she did that, and the reason you do that, and the reason I do it, is because the word Chad is funny and is a great word for a man of bulletproof fuckability.It‚Äôs also indicative of more pernicious and more destructive ideas that can seep in just by sheer proximity. The way that there‚Äôs research indicating that if you force yourself to smile, you feel happier. Who knows, it‚Äôs pop psychology bullshit, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs real or not. But I do think it‚Äôs real in the sort of digital-political realm, where just by touching these ideas, you are susceptible to them in some way.This is data from r/Braincels and r/TheRedPill. These are the most popular subreddits for both people. The one that really stuck out to me in the r/Braincels results was the subreddit NEET, which stands for ‚ÄúNot in Employment, Education or Training‚Äù, and I have kind of a long thought I want to launch into for a minute.This overlap between the sexual and economic outcasts is I think brought up really well in Nagle‚Äôs book. She‚Äôs talking about this guy Roger Devlin in this passage:His essay ‚ÄúSexual Utopia and Power‚Äù argues against ‚Äútoday‚Äôs sexual dystopia with its loose morals and confused sexual roles. It explores ‚Äú female hypergamy‚Äù, mating up, narcissism, infidelity, deceptiveness, and masochism.‚Äù It also argues that ‚Äúthe breakdown of monogamy results in promiscuity for the few, loneliness for the majority.‚ÄùOn this last point, I think he‚Äôs getting to the central issue driving this kind of reactionary sexual politics, perhaps even the central personal motivation behind the entire turn to the far right among young men. The sexual revolution that started the decline of lifelong marriage has produced great freedom from the shackles of loveless marriage and selfless duty to the family for both men and women, but this ever-extended adolescence has also brought with it the rise of adult childlessness and a steep sexual hierarchy. Sexual patterns that have emerged as a result of the decline of monogamy have seen a greater level of sexual toys for an elite of men and a growing celibacy among the large male population at the bottom of the pecking order. Their own anxiety and anger about their lower ranking status in this hierarchy is precisely what it‚Äôs produced that are hard line rhetoric about asserting hierarchy in the world politically when it comes to women and non-whites. The pain of relentless rejection has festered in these forums and allowed them to be the masters of the cruel natural hierarchies that bring them so much humiliation.I thought of two things when I read this passage. The first was a graph from this book Dataclysm by Christian Rudder, who founded OkCupid. Rudder ultimately published this book that drew on a lot of different datasets but also used the OkCupid dataset. This is one of the analyses that was published in Dataclysm. OkCupid doesn‚Äôt work like this anymore as I understand, but for a long time when you came across another user, you would rate them from one to five stars. It‚Äôs probably good we don‚Äôt do that anymore. But that was how the platform operated. And I remember that if you were in a certain echelon of people, if you were in the top 10 percent or whatever-and I wasn‚Äôt-you would get this email that congratulated you on being the creme de la creme of attractiveness.According to the data on OkCupid, women find men less attractive than men find women. And I think you can synthesize what Nagle is saying with this graph and just see this swelling discontent on incels.co and Braincels and TheRedPill as essentially the casualties of this new sexual system we‚Äôve been developing since the 1970s where relations are reduced to this sexual marketplace.The second thing I thought of was basically the entire worldview of Michel Houellebecq, whose ideas I see throughout Kill All Normies. His first big book has written a lot about how the sexual revolution, despite being associated with the left, was really the beginning of a cultural neoliberalism. Just as institutions under neoliberalism have dissolved and been taken over by market forces, our social relations are unmediated by anything other than sheer desire and you end up with nothing but a bazaar of flesh. One result of that is that you end up with a sexual underclass, the sexual counterpart to the NEET subreddit. Just as people are cast away from the job market through automation and are no longer able to adapt to the world necessary to survive economically, it‚Äôs more difficult for people to survive in this new sexual reality, especially one that provides a method of meeting people on digital platforms that optimize for quick, weak interactions that give little opportunity for anything other than physicality to dominate the selection process.I think the bearing that reality has on people differs on geography. I don‚Äôt know how much Tinder is used in Laramie, Wyoming, where I used to live, but I can tell you that it is the dominant method by which people meet each other in places like New York City. And I have watched people move here and thrive or die in that system. I have seen people go in completely opposite directions. I can think of two people off the top of my head where this happened. One of them was a very attractive girl who moved to Brooklyn from Philadelphia, and I think Philadelphia is less dictated by this ruthless superficiality than New York, which makes a lot of sense when you think about New York as a neoliberal center, both economically and in this cultural sense we‚Äôre talking about. She moved here and became this #bestself member of this culture‚Äôs sexual elite who saw her own sexual activity as basically the extent of her politics.The other friend also moved here from Philadelphia and I guess he split with his girlfriend or something, and I found these Red Pill leanings creeping into his personality. He believed women‚Äôs brains were hackable. He would call women ugly to me. It was really weird. And I would tell him not to do it and he would laugh and find it funny. To him, that was his own brand of 4chan offensiveness, he was upsetting these feminist sensibilities of the left. And what was so fucking bizarre was that he was kind of a leftist. He worked as an environmental organizer for years and lived in Brooklyn and had a bookshelf of Chuck Klosterman and whatever you would find on a Brooklyn bookshelf. But I think the longer he went without sex, the more hateful he became. He actually referred to himself as celibate. He would say, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm celibate now.‚Äù He never said incel. I had never heard that term actually until 2018, but he was the first person I ever knew who referred to himself as celibate.My friendships with both these people reached their conclusions for these very reasons, which sucks because in New York City friendships don‚Äôt abound. But it was bizarre to see both of them sort of convert to this worldview.EY: It seems like that worldview is being forced upon her, not her reinforcing the assumptions of that ideology.AT: Absolutely, and that that‚Äôs my whole point. Even if incels engage in toxic behavior, they exist in a macro historical moment in which that behavior is cultivated. That absolutely goes for her, and it goes from my other friend as well. It goes for all of us, not to completely dismiss any kind of agency. And I think that this is an environment that I‚Äôm always relieved when people acknowledge, whether it be Houellebecq or Nagle.EY: But then I think that things like the Amazon documentary The Red Pill and places like Rolling Stone and all of them almost never investigate this, the moment that we find ourselves in that is creating this kind of hyper-sexual frustration.AT: And I will say as well, so not only have things been replaced by this sexual marketplace but we are daily inundated with images establishing what sort of conventional existence looks like. There‚Äôs a fascinating paper written by Jonah Peretti, who founded Buzzfeed, wrote when he was at MIT. It‚Äôs one of the most interesting papers I think I‚Äôve ever read. His whole idea was that in this current stage of capitalism, we cycle through identities more quickly.Lacan had this idea in his psychoanalysis of the Mirror Stage where the child develops a sense of itself when it looks at the mirror and it recognizes itself. But this phenomenon is extended past the mirror and into images. So we don‚Äôt just identify with the reflection of ourselves in the mirror. We then identify with the image on the movie screen or the TV screen or phone screen or whatever sort of picture is looking back at us. And that sort of becomes our sense of self as well.Because we are so inundated with these images and these narratives, we find ways to reconcile our own sense of identity with this identity that is projected back at us from the screen. You can think of a child after they watch The Avengers, they go and they play Avengers with their friends and they think of themselves as Captain America and Black Widow and whatever. That‚Äôs kind of a very rudimentary, basic example of this idea of the child taking on the identify of the screen.But we do this all the time as adults. So extrapolate that behavior to an adult looking at an image in a Chanel advertisement or watching The Social Network, and they see in the mirror a model or a machinating startup CEO. The adult takes on the identity of what is projected at them by the image and then reconciles their own sense of self with what they see projected at them.With people like incels you have something of an identity crisis. Because of this new sexual marketplace, they are no longer able to close the gap between their own identities and the identities projected back at them in the image. And because of the endless white noise of media, they are drowning in reminders of their very inability to close that gap.Something the activist-turned-red-piller/black-piller I mentioned observed that I think is very true is that we don‚Äôt really have an outlet for men who don‚Äôt have sex or can‚Äôt have sex for whatever reason. There‚Äôs no monastery for them to join. We have created this system where you are either getting laid or you‚Äôre not. Those are your two options. And if you can‚Äôt reconcile your identity with that of the image, which is almost universally an image of someone having lots of sex, we don‚Äôt really give you any other options. There‚Äôs no image of, like, a monk.I sent you that Oneohtrix Point Never video, I don‚Äôt know if you watched it or not.EY: Yes, I watched it. I watched the shit out of it.AT: To me it captures everything about what we‚Äôre saying in the span of four minutes, for the most part. Mostly what it captures is that alienation and ostracization and totally unfulfillable desire among these people. That there‚Äôs just no way to satiate these urges, and the urges become ever more extreme the more time you spend feeding them and dwelling within them. Nagle‚Äôs quote about the unsatiated desire being the fundament of everything is captured in that OPN video better than anything I‚Äôve seen.EY: Yeah, I think so. And something interesting that stood out to me about that video is that there are no ‚Äúreal women‚Äù in that video, it‚Äôs all furries or hentai. It makes me wonder whether the phenomenon of incels loving hentai is almost self-fulfilling-they pine after these girls and they have these waifus and they love these things just because part of them knows that this isn‚Äôt an obtainable, real thing. It‚Äôs another form of comfort and safety for them. Like, ‚ÄúI can fall in love with a fictional character, and some part of me knows that will never happen, so committing to that is safe.‚ÄùAT: I also think that it‚Äôs a sign of just how alien an actual woman is to this culture. It is so distant and abstract that it becomes unreal. In a way, the furries and the hentai girls are both literal depictions of what these people end up desiring, but also these non literal representations of what women are to them.I looked up ‚Äúred pill‚Äù and I looked up ‚Äúblack pill‚Äù on /pol. People say ‚Äúred pill‚Äù more, but it‚Äôs interesting to see the climb of ‚Äúblack pill‚Äù relative to ‚Äúred pill‚Äù and I‚Äôm wondering in your research if you‚Äôve gotten the sense that the use of term is becoming more pervasive. Do you think that it indicates a deeping nihilism among these people, or is this just kind of a coincidence?EY: To me it just feels like ‚Äúred pill‚Äù is becoming a normie concept now. It‚Äôs mainstream. So they‚Äôre kind of getting backed into a corner and I don‚Äôt know where you can go past the black pill. There‚Äôs no darker black pill.AT: The jet black pill.EY: Seeing this makes me feel like, Okay there is this kind of ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú I‚Äôm trying to reconcile this rejection of the mainstream with all the other things you‚Äôre talking to me about. Like because it is ‚Ä¶ because the mainstream idea is the sexual marketplace, right? And then there‚Äôs the belief that the sexual marketplace can‚Äôt benefit you. And so I feel like those ideas kind of intertwined like the wires get crossed or something. Where once an idea starts to become part of a more mainstream cultural consciousness it becomes almost, yuck, you‚Äôre deterred from it.It reminds that I was talking to this guy who went viral talking about his alt-right journey and one word that he kept using I actually had never used before was ‚Äúboomer‚Äù. He was saying like, ‚ÄúOh they‚Äôre just a bunch of Boomers.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just Boomer talk.‚Äù And so that really had me thinking about the way all of this stuff is situated in their minds. It all can come back to that enemy outside thing. And so once the Red Pill ideas are hitting mainstream and if ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say Chads start building in TheRedPill, which they can do, the Red Pill isn‚Äôt an exclusively incel thing, then where do you go. You have to start moving into this space where it‚Äôs like, Okay this ideology is now not somewhere that I feel safe. I have to take it further. And that just gets encouraged by everyone else who feels the same way and feels like you have to be edgy. You have to be on the edge, you have to be on the fringe.AT: I feel like that pertains to this other result here. I looked at all three-word combinations used in any /pol post with the words ‚Äúred pill‚Äù and the one that stuck out to me was any terms that include the word ‚Äúultimate‚Äù. This idea of the ultimate red pill, and how commonly that factors into these discussions, this idea of like taking the final red pill. Nick Land‚Äôs decision to title his manifesto the ‚ÄúDark Enlightenment‚Äù bears on this as well, I think, which implies a forbidden knowledge.It makes me think of something Mark Fisher said in this essay he wrote about Joy Division. ‚ÄúThe depressive is always confident of one thing: that he is without illusions.‚Äù There‚Äôs this idea that the more nihilistic the idea is, the truer is must be. And I wonder if that becomes its own reinforcement to people who traffic in the language of the red pill and the black pill and the dark enlightenment. That because it‚Äôs so nihilistic, it is this form of realism.EY: It reminds me of how incels will go and they‚Äôll post pictures of themselves to be rated on, fully expecting and knowing for a fact that all they‚Äôre going to get is criticism and reaffirmation that their worldview, that they‚Äôre never going to be able to fuck, is true. It‚Äôs almost comforting in the most depressing sense: Everything I‚Äôm thinking is right, I am worthless, I am terrible, any hope is illusion.",31/05/2019,0,0,25,18,806,648,5,0,0,4,8
White on black or black on white? The pros and cons of Dark Mode,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/white-on-black-or-black-on-white-the-pros-and-cons-of-dark-mode-3439e37d6c6c,Takuma Kakehi,159,8,1277,"There has been a lot of talk and leaks about Dark Mode for the upcoming WWDC 2019 (Exclusive: Screenshots reveal iOS 13 Dark Mode, new Reminders app, more | 9to5Mac). In the new iOS 13, you can turn on enable Dark Mode in the Settings app or from the option in the control center. According to the image shared in the article, their Music app seems to be using the true black background.I personally use the Pixel phone from Google. I currently have Pixel 3, my third Pixel device, and I must say that its relatively shorter battery life in comparison to other smartphones has been my headache. Because I wanted to get the most out of my recent trip to LA, I mainly used Lyft rides for transportation, and I was forced to have my laptop open very frequently to charge my phone on each ride to simply keep it stay alive.During the recent Google I/O, Google thankfully announced that they would include Dark Theme in their new android Q. In fact, I had been using Dark Theme even on my current Android version, but the one with Q seems to take it even further. For example, the dark background color is or is at least closer to pure black than the current dark gray; more elements, such as notification bubbles, are also in the dark background, unlike the current version. Google is influencing more Android apps to adopt dark themes.Old computer screens were in dark mode; this is due to what the early cathode-ray tube, which is what powered those old, boxy-style televisions, could do. As graphical interface was adopted and the display technology advanced, people who were not programmers were also introduced to computers. Then, as a skeuomorphic approach, having black text on a white background, just like regular paper, was adopted, (The entry about skeuomorphic design: The power of familiarity in Design: skeuomorphic triggers and personified machines). The approach gained attractions as word processing became the significant tool for every corporation.Smartphones increased the number of hours people faced screens in general, but also in dark bedrooms. With the impact of glaring white screens in dark bedrooms, many people associate dark mode with being better for our eyes. Although sudden introduction of glares could cause eye strains in the short-term when reading, the long-term health effects resulting from regular use of either dark or light screens are not conclusive; it hasn‚Äôt been very long since people have started spending quite a bit of on screens everyday, and we don‚Äôt have a large enough sample size to determine this. However, there are many studies that support the notion that reading on lighter screens give one a better long-time reading experience.In the study by Richard H. Hall and Patrick Hanna, The Effect Of Web Page Text-background Color Combinations On Retention And Perceived Readability, Aesthetics And Behavioral Intention, subjects responded that they could engage better with dark on light text than its counterpart, for example.When the background is light and more light is lit, one‚Äôs pupils contract. Smaller pupils create a wide depth-of-field. On the other hand, less light causes one‚Äôs pupils to widen, which makes the focal point shallower; this means that it‚Äôs more effort to focus in dark mode. Also, light text scatters light around and causes a halo effect easily on a dark background; it‚Äôs harder for eyes to focus and could tire easily. On the other hand, dark text on a light background allows the text to appear with crisp edges.Additionally, in previously conducted surveys, a lot of people responded that dark mode could cause them to lose interest in the content their engaging with more quickly than without dark mode. This, in fact, could be useful for preventing them from spending too much time on social media. Although dark mode is far superior for one‚Äôs health when bedside browsing, studies show that dark mode may not be helpful for a long term comfortable reading experience.As I mentioned in the beginning, tech companies are pushing to have dark mode as an option. Thanks to the wide adaptation of OLED screens to smartphones, dark mode drastically helps the battery life of mobile devices. To begin with, OLED screens improve the battery life by 30% compared to LCD screen with the same screen spec.This is because OLED can illuminate each pixel only if it is needed. On the other hand, LCD renders content by blocking the light with liquid crystal, hence the backlight has to always be on.Google presented how the battery use of Google Map navigation in its night mode drops by 63% on Pixel devices with AMOLED (active matrix OLED, a type of OLED that supports various display sizes)compared to the normal mode. In contrast, the iPhone 7 that carried LCD did not show any difference between LCD and AMOLED.The chart below shows how the white screen, when fully lit, consumes so much more power than the black screen. The graph also shows how blue light consumes a lot more power compared to red or green.Below, I‚Äôm archiving how dark mode was implemented in different applications and use cases. I will continue adding more use cases to the list as I encounter different applications with dark mode.Pocket introduced the dark theme back in 2012. The theme helps with the late night reading experience, and it especially makes sense for Pocket, with its core proposition to save curious online content for later, or the user‚Äôs best time to read.Twitter and Social MediaTwitter was one of the early dark-mode adopters amongst social media. The initial Night Mode was introduced in 2016.Mac OS MojaveApple announced their first full-functioning dark mode to Mac OS at WWDC 2018. The dark mode on their operating system was wished by their users for long time. Some users have said that it helps them focus on content, and that it reduces screen glares that had previously caused eyestrain.Dark Theme on Android OS since PieSaaS program, Data visualization, and Program editorsMany professional tools incorporate dark mode to minimize eye strain. Although a lengthy text reading experience in dark mode may not be the best for concentration, some data visualization tools utilize dark screen nonetheless. Colors also pop in a darker background better, and it is easy to construct a visual hierarchy to highlight an element that needs some extra attention.Programmers who spend long hours in front of screens are also widely known to favor dark mode to help their eyes. It also helps reading different programming language types with clearer colors on a dark background. It also helps identifying programming language taxonomy well, through by nicely well prepared color themes by different programming editing programs.YouTubeOriginal post: http://www.ta-kuma.com/product-design/white-on-black-or-black-on-white-the-pros-and-cons-of-dark-mode/Android Q‚Äôs dark mode is darker than the Battle of Winterfell | The VergeThe Impact of Web Page Text-Background Color Combinations on Readability,Retention, Aesthetics, and Behavioral IntentionDark mode has taken over: the latest on this battery-saving feature | The VergeBack in black: how to turn on dark mode and save your battery | mobilesyrupHere‚Äôs every Google app with a dark mode, and how to enable it | 9to5GoogleGoogle confirms dark mode is a huge help for battery life on Android | The VergeEvery Gadget and App Should Have a Dark Mode | The Wall Street JournalTwitter Goes Dark.

Starting in UX after 40,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/starting-in-ux-after-40-4871b89d2c2b,Ernesto Pe√±a (he/him),150,5,960,"After more than 20 years of being at the margins of every single design trend, I found myself face to face with UX. Surprisingly, all the inadequacy that I thought I would experience soon faded away as I realized that precisely because of my age and my personal history, and for the first time in a long time, I had an unexpected advantage.I sat in front of a computer for the first time approximately two years into my bachelor in graphic design, pretty much the same day my school inaugurated the computer lab, and I loved the experience. The first design software that I learned was CorelDraw and Photoshop. I didn‚Äôt care about the very limited number of undos or being able to store only 1.44 Mb at a time. To be honest, I was so bad with manual techniques (Illustration, Letraset transfers, etc.) that I really had no choice. My cohort and I did have a couple of courses on HTML, but I never really cared that much about ‚Äúweb design‚Äù, and I thought I didn‚Äôt need it anyway, I had what I deemed to be very solid design theory foundations (my favourite topics were semiotics and rhetoric) and I wanted to be an editorial designer and typographer. I was wrong, of course.Over the next few years, with the development of the web 1.0, many designers turned their attention to web development, some of my former peers among them. My generation had so much advantage over me already that I thought I would never be able to catch up, so I turned all my attention (very reluctantly) to branding, finding solace in the occasional editorial project. I had a couple of gigs working as a print designer for web companies until I decided to go back to school to get a master degree in information design, a discipline that I considered (and still consider) to be more challenging and interesting. My time in the master programme reminded me of how much I loved the theoretical part of design. I was suddenly back into semiotics and rhetoric as I applied many of their principles to visualization methods while delving deeper into typography. I was really enjoying it, but I was also keenly aware that my new found interest in Infodesign was pushing me even further away from the design trend of the time (web 2.0).After a short term in Berlin working for an information design studio, I became convinced that my absolute lack of knowledge (and frankly, interest) on digital tools had rendered me completely irrelevant as a designer. I started doing independent research on design methods and teaching (activities that I still enjoy quite a lot) while trying to maintain a design studio. I partnered with a talented designer, who tackled most of the responsibilities of production, while I spent most of the time researching, conceptualizing and writing white papers. I took my reluctance to engage in hands-on design and my interest in teaching as signs:‚ÄúI am not that kind of designer anymore, maybe I never was‚Äù, I thought. I had finally pushed myself completely out of practical design.Looking for the next logical step (to become a design educator) I enrolled in a Ph.D. program, not in design, but education.I started my Ph.D. in my mid-30s. I was over 40 when I graduated. During my Ph.D. programme, I got involved in digital humanities, which led to data visualization, semiotics and rhetoric. I was convinced that I was going to become a professor, mostly because that seems to be the natural path for most Ph.D., but academic jobs in North America are remarkably scarce and I couldn‚Äôt afford to wait for an opening. Through my extended network, I learned about an opportunity to do ethnographic research for a startup and, without being completely clear about what the job would entail, I took it. ‚ÄúI can do this‚Äù, I thought, ‚Äúafter all, I am a fairly good interviewer, I have a lot of practice analyzing qualitative data, and because I am an information designer, I know how to present research insights in a clear way‚Äù.It was in this job that I heard the term ‚ÄúUX‚Äù for the first time and I quickly realized that the core principles were remarkably familiar. Design thinking was an abbreviated version of Munari‚Äôs design research methodology, most UX formats are data visualizations (which I knew how to deal with) and my Ph.D. gave me a well-rounded understanding of research methods and analytic rigour.Fairly quickly, I started designing, developing and assessing complex research projects. I got familiar with the UX methods and practices in a short period of time and started adapting academic research methods to my UX practice and developing my own, depending on the circumstances. I integrated quantitative and mixed methods to my research toolkit, and consequently, I became more confident as a researcher. However, this confidence did not come from knowing more stuff. I learned that UX, as opposed to graphic or even information design is less about the details and more about exactly the opposite. It is about taking distance and connecting the dots. It is about tackling issues in a holistic way, it‚Äôs about embracing design as a research-based, problem-solving methodology. The kind of things that you cannot replace (yet) with technology.Surprisingly, I ended up getting into UX research (a relatively recent trend, at the time of writing these lines) before my college peers and many of my further students. For the first time in a long time, the pieces seem to be in place. True, it took me more than 20 years, but it was 20 years of learning, leading to a realization:Apparently, I was a UX researcher all along, I just didn‚Äôt know it. Could this be your case too?",30/05/2019,3,0,2,1,1050,775,2,0,0,5,309
"Reflection point: usability, accessibility, and ethics in UX",UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/reflection-point-usability-accessibility-and-ethics-in-user-experience-design-7f95e27b8273,Nicole Tanoue,63,4,781,"There‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than a website or app that is confusing and difficult to navigate. You start to question your own competency and think, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I figure this out?‚ÄùThe opportunity to create experiences that are satisfying to the everyday user and also accessible to people with disabilities was one of the main factors that contributed to my decision to pursue a career in UX Design. Usability, accessibility, and ethics is so important since we use digital products every day, and these experiences shape our overall happiness and wellbeing.Information Architecture heuristics are a set of principles that help designers determine how good IA is: Findable, Accessible, Clear, Communicative, Usable, Credible, Controllable, Valuable, Learnable, Delightful.When assessing a digital product‚Äôs usability, designers might consider the following:The usefulness of a product is at the core of UX Design since it affects everything about the overall experience. Thus, in-house design teams assess the usability of a product using their own set of heuristics: Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, and Satisfaction (LEMErS).A product must be easy to learn upon initially using it, as well as when using it after a long period break. The functions should mimic how people interact with the real world so there is not a learning curve in developing new ways of working. The design of a product should be consistent in labeling, actions, and layout, so the user knows what to expect. While it‚Äôs best to not need a ‚Äúhelp‚Äù section at all, it‚Äôs best to provide it in case a user runs into issues using the product.An example of an app with great usability is the myQ app, which allows you to open and close your garage door directly from the app, utilizes mapping to mimic the feel of clicking on a physical garage door opener. To open or close the garage door, you click on the circular button with the icon in the center.It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to use a slider here since that‚Äôs not how you open and close a garage door. The design they implemented allowed me to understand exactly how to use the product upon first opening the app. I didn‚Äôt have to read a manual or think twice about how to use it.I don‚Äôt know how someone of an older generation who isn‚Äôt a digital native would understand the functions of the app, but for an everyday person it is very intuitive. A person in an older generation may just stick to a physical garage door opener in the first place.Accessibility is extremely important in design since it lowers the barrier to entry and gives equal opportunity to people of all abilities. Accessibility should not be an afterthought, but rather a priority and a necessity.When assessing a product‚Äôs accessibility, everyone on the ‚Äî from the User Researcher, Content Strategist, Information Architect, to the Interaction Designer ‚Äî should consider:Many people rely on voice recognition software, screen magnifiers, screen readers or hardware assistive devices to complete actions on the computer. When designing your digital product, it‚Äôs important to consider all of these groups.As a designer, it is important to manage the flow of the product you are designing. Any interaction should be able to be completed by a keyboard only, and the order of items on the page should be listed in order for the blind, visually impaired, or for keyboard users. Designers who consider accessibility map out and show developers exactly what order they would like.Designs should have visual redundancy or multiple methods to complete a certain action or get the same information. Making it as seamless as possible for users of all abilities makes great design, not just designing for what looks good.The issue of ethics in design goes hand-in-hand with usability and accessibility. When a digital product has the specific goal of deceiving users to perform an act they didn‚Äôt intend to, it‚Äôs called a Dark Pattern. Examples include adding order processing fees without informing the user or creating confusing opt-in labels with double-negatives that trick the user into opting-in to receiving notifications or emails. Darkpatterns.org works to spread awareness of this ethical issue and to stop websites from using them.As someone who has been tricked by forced continuity, or rolling over from free to paid plans without warning, I know first hand how Dark Patterns strip away trust. There should always be an opt-in or warning before a free service becomes a paid one.There is so much more to a great digital product than simply looking good and working for an able-bodied user. A truly great product is easy to use for people of all abilities and inspires trust through well-thought-out user experience and prioritization of transparency with their pricing and billing structure.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,0,725,705,2,2,0,3,136
Experiences that delight: how we emotionally engage with design,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/experiences-that-delight-how-we-emotionally-engage-with-design-fc0f92292231,Ian Batterbee,1500,6,1171,"I remember the time when my wife told me a story about a little boy who had a quirk for only eating a banana out of its skin; he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. If the banana was chopped into pieces and served in a bowl, he would refuse it. But what‚Äôs wrong with it chopped up? It‚Äôs still going to taste the same.The point of the story is that the little boy wanted the experience of eating the banana in his way. Being able to hold and peel the fruit gave him a sense of independence. The tangible aspect somehow made the banana taste and feel so much better. Whilst it may seem like a strange quirk, it was the little boy‚Äôs experience that mattered.We can relate this quirk to our idiosyncrasies that may seem odd or out of the norm, but they reflect our preferences, likes and dislikes. We all want to experience something unique and personal.The following examples demonstrate how people emotionally engage (in their own weird and wonderful ways) with products and services:Some people prefer the classic glass tomato ketchup bottle to its squeezable plastic counterpart. Whilst the plastic alternative is more efficient and effective, the traditional glass version holds nostalgic and premium value.People draw sensation from tapping the end of the glass bottle, and even from the way how the red sauce spurt out. And, they prefer to spend more money on a glass condiment because of its perceived premium value (even though the sauce inside tastes the same).The tomato ketchup bottle preference demonstrates how some people will choose the experience over the product ‚Äî no matter how convenient the alternative is and the likelihood that the ketchup tastes the same.Music is now easily accessible in many contemporary mediums such as streaming services. However, some music enthusiasts prefer to invest good money in vintage vinyl records. They want to enjoy the nostalgic aspects such as loading the record onto the player, moving the needle onto the disc, and listening to the grainy sounds.People choose vinyl records because they want to enjoy the tangible and nostalgic aspects, which simply cannot be experienced in the same way through contemporary mediums.I know someone who‚Äôll drive 40 minutes out of town for a haircut; he claims it comes with a beer and a good service! Whilst you can easily get an affordable haircut from somewhere local, some people are willing to travel further or pay twice the price for a better experience.Whether it‚Äôs an expensive haircut, going to a live music concert, or just having dinner with friends, people find more value in memorable and meaningful experiences over the financial and materialistic aspects.To understand how people emotionally engage with design (such as classic tomato ketchup bottles and nostalgic vinyl records), we can refer to UX guru ‚Äî Don Norman‚Äôs Three Levels of Design: an emotional system that consists of different processes that influence our experience.The Three Levels of Design are:The visceral reaction is the most basic level of processing. Don Norman describes it as ‚Äúthe lizard brain‚Äù, which is ingrained into our minds so we can respond quickly without any conscious awareness. Take first impressions, for example, when we see a slick-looking smartphone, our animalistic nature influences us to want that product for its aesthetic and premium qualities.Carrying out activities, achieving objectives quickly and effectively, and how intuitive a product is for skilled or inexperienced users, are all controlled aspects of behavioural processing. Don Norman describes this level of processing as ‚Äúthe home of learned skills‚Äù. Take riding a bike, for example, you subconsciously push the pedals and steer the handles to move along.The reflective level is the highest order of processing, and Don Norman states, ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making takes place‚Äù. Have you ever reflected on a bad service such as an awful haircut or a terrible dining experience? During this level of processing, you analyse all the events and feelings you experienced and then decide on whether to go back or find another service elsewhere.Banana example:Using the Three Levels of Design, we can better understand how we emotionally engage with popular contemporary mediums:The Nest thermostat is a nifty smart home device that learns your schedule, programs itself and uses Wi-fi to connect to your smartphone.What makes the Nest unique are the simplistic design and intuitive controls. To adjust the temperate, you simply turn the ring up or down, just like a normal thermostat. For the more skilled user, you can access additional features by pressing and turning the ring.Hidden within the Nest are some pleasantly surprising features such as the soothing faint clicking sounds from the turn of the ring, and the luminous green eco leaves (indicators of energy-saving temperature) that appear on the digital display.For a smart home device that‚Äôs primary function is to control the heating, the Nest holds some special qualities to make the experience delightful. The slick and stylish design can easily attract your attention (visceral). The intuitive controls make the device feel natural to use (behavioural). And the combination of simplistic design, familiar usability, and emotional feedback, influences conscious decision-making and positive thoughts (reflective).Damn! The Wi-Fi is down and you can‚Äôt use the Internet. Whilst you‚Äôre waiting to go back online, why not play the Google Chrome jump-and-run dinosaur game with the tap of the keyboard space bar.The monochrome game is quite addictive; you can easily spend 10 minutes making the cute little dinosaur jump over a series of obstacles. This awesome secret (also known as an ‚ÄòEaster egg‚Äô) certainly beats the usual mundane ‚Äòno internet connection‚Äô dead-ends most web browsers offer.What makes the Google Chrome dinosaur game emotionally engaging is the fact that it pleasantly surprises you. When playing the game, all three levels of design influences our experience: it looks fun, it‚Äôs easy to control, and I want to keep playing it.Personal assistants (such as Amazon‚Äôs Alexa) have become a real novelty and a must-have product for the home.What makes Alexa special is her programmed personality, which comes with surprising wit and irony. Providing that you ask Alexa the right questions or commands, she can delight you with quirky responses such as her ‚Äòcats and boots‚Äô beatbox and a sarcastic explanation on why fire trucks are red ‚Äî just give it a go.Alexa is cleverly engineered in such a way as to make you feel that you‚Äôre interacting with a real person. The interaction with Alexa involves a huge conversational aspect, which particularly triggers the levels of behavioural and reflective processing. And, it is the relationship between these processes that influence a delightful experience.It‚Äôs important to develop empathy for people by understanding their behaviour, their attitudes and quirks. People directly or inadvertently experience things in their own weird and wonderful ways.By using Don Norman‚Äôs Three Levels of Design, we can identify the reasons why and how people emotionally engage with products or services.When a product, brand, or service has an emotional aspect, they become unique and personal, and they give experiences that delight.",31/05/2019,0,0,4,5,1050,787,1,2,0,1,221
What game is your company playing?,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/what-game-is-your-company-playing-2f83dd40c48e,Aga Sz√≥stek,2600,7,1495,"But there is also the infinite game where there can be known and also unknown players, rules will change over time and the only objective there is to keep the game going, to perpetuate it. It is in no way about winning or loosing. It is about outliving your competitors over time.Let‚Äôs look at any business today. What game do they think they are in? Looking at the constant chase after the quarterly results, rankings and becoming number one (whatever that means), it is reasonable to assume they see themselves in the finite game. A game that seems to end every quarter or every year. And they they pick it up again.What many organizations don‚Äôt see is that, in fact, they are take a part of an infinite game. You might think you know your competition but there might be another player cooking up some solution that will disturb your status quo. Let‚Äôs look at the skiing business. For decades it was the sole way to enjoy your winter activity in the mountains. You could have chosen the free ride skis, the touring skis, the racing skis, but they were all skis. And suddenly snowboard arrived. Out of nowhere. And it has profoundly disturbed the ski business.Another example is telecommunication. It is a no-brainer that the mobile services are offered by the telecom companies, right? But, in fact, the most attractive offer today is provided by Google not by AT&T or T-Mobile or Sprint. Any business out there might think they know who they are competing against. But this knowledge is as of today. Tomorrow there can, and there will be an unknown player biting at the pieces of their business they might no be able to imagine today.Before Zappos nobody imagined you could have the whole year to return an item that you bought online. Today customers get disappointed and might even decide not to shop with you if you don‚Äôt have a reasonable free-return policy. Or let‚Äôs consider the unpacking experience. Before Apple package might have been a thing in luxury cosmetics business but no much anywhere else. Today customers expect to have the product they purchase wrapped in a way that more and more resembles gift-wrapping that simply protecting the sent product. Before Revolut customers knew they had to have dedicated accounts for different currencies and they were grumpily agreeing to the extra charges for conversion. Today, more and more of them won‚Äôt even think of using the traditional banking services for that anymore. In every single case the rules of the game have changed based on the actions performed by the player many of the companies in these areas didn‚Äôt quite expected to see.Dave Snowden, the complexity theory professor from Wales, hit the nail on the head in this respect when he has combined two models: the chasm variation and the S-Curve model into something he called the flexuous curve (or the F-Curve for short). What the model shows is this. Each an every business on the planet goes through the S-Curve: they enter the market, then they hit the chasm. If they survive it, they are up for a rapid growth until they hit maturity and then eventually decline. The chasm on this model can be explained by the dominance of another player on the market who Dave calls, quite appropriately, an apex-predator. But once the apex-predator becomes so convinced they are winning the game, here comes the chance for the new kid on the block to overtake the game, change the rules and go for rapid growth. So, it might very well be that the game for the former apex-predator is lost but the game itself goes on.Here‚Äôs the interesting thing. If you put two finite or two infinite players against each other the game remains stable. But what happens if you have an infinite player against the finite one? While the finite player is playing to win, the infinite player aims to perpetuate the game itself. As a person who grew up in communist Poland, I have first hand experienced what it meant. Because while the communist government kept on trying to win the game of ruling my country and making everyone listen to the communist party, our underground forces were playing quite a different game. They knew freedom will come at some point, so the goal behind it was to keep the game going until the other player runs out of fuel and influence to keep the game going.This is exactly the game of business. It started before your company arrived on the market and it will continue long after it is gone. So, there is no winning in this very game. The goal is to keep on playing (and having fun playing) as long as it is possible. Sure, you might keep on striving to be number 1 in this or that ranking over and over again. This is a finite game that you play year in year out. But you might, instead, choose to keep on winning the hearts of your customers over and over again. This is an infinite game in its very essence.There is, of course, a number of directions that can be chosen for the ambition for your infinite game. One of them is to deliver remarkable experiences to your customers. It is a basis for an infinite game in its deepest meaning. Due to the positive adaptation and therefore the need to keep on shaping unforgettable memories in your customers‚Äô heads over and over again, it is self-perpetuating endeavor. But there is one crucial element to even begin to play that game: to know which direction you want to go.You can, of course have a number of finite games in your infinite game. For example, fixing basics so that you stay en par with your competition seems like a finite game starting over and over again. But the way to stay different in the perceptions of your customers you need to align yourself, your resources and your decision making process along the goal of your infinite game. In that way you will create a competitive advantage that truly distinguishes yourself from your competition in a way that is not easily copy-able. So, in the deepest sense you will become your own biggest competitor. Look at the exceptional companies out there: Zappos, Tesla, Southwest Airlines, Harley Davidson ‚Äî they are not competing with others. Not really. Their game is with their past selves and past selves only. And the success is not measured quarterly. It is measured in years if not decades.This is why for an infinite player it is not that important to be first every single day and with every product. They play to be loved in the long run by knowing why they do what they do, and where they are going. Because you will sometime be ahead and sometimes behind. So, it is crucial to keep on thinking: ‚Äî how can I make my experience better than yesterday? How else can I convince my customers to tell the stories about me that reflect what I try to achieve? I bet that once you choose to play the infinite game you will find yourself ahead more often than you would expect. Because this game is not about winning each single battle and scoring each point. It is about building long-lasting trust and loyalty in your customers. Drip by drip. To play long enough so that your competition stays behind and eventually drops out of the game.The trick of such an approach is this: if you choose to play an infinite game of winning the hearts of your customers you will take radically different strategic decision from your competition that sticks to the finite game of winning this or that ranking. And maybe not immediately but the difference will become noticeable over time. Because you will not be going against something. You will be standing for something. Does it mean that you shouldn‚Äôt look at the competition at all? Not in the least. It is worthwhile to remember that what your competition does is to reveal to you your weaknesses. It is, in a way, your sanity check.But first and foremost you need to choose which game you are in. Once you know that, choose what the ultimate goal of your game is: your own experience vision. Next, decide what winning or loosing means by knowing how to measure your progress by looking at the stories your customers tell about you. And finally, keep a flexible playbook so you are able to adjust your course of action based on what your customers dream about.__________________________________________________________________Aga Sz√≥stek, PhD is an experience designer with over 19 years of practice in both academic and business world.

Some proposed color heuristics,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/some-proposed-color-heuristics-a323e8fed5f3,Alex O'Neal,187,6,1053,"Most digital designers are familiar with Jakob Nielsen's ten heuristics for user interface design. They‚Äôre a perfect list, because they provide guidance for both novice and expert; you can take the advice at a high level, but dig deeply, too. Others have adapted them into slightly different or condensed versions, all of which are useful.Still, there‚Äôs an area of design that affects everything we do, but which lacks strong guidance. We have best practices for some areas of it ‚Äî the psychology of color, the accessibility of color, the uses of color in data visualization ‚Äî but we don‚Äôt have universal guidelines.I‚Äôve spent many years developing, applying, and refining color usage best practices, and training others in the same; I‚Äôve studied the different ways color is used to carry information, how to make color accessible, how to make it usable, and more. I conducted formal color perception testing in college, and have implemented, measured, and tested color use in multiple industries: healthcare, business intelligence, technology, education. Now I‚Äôve synthesized that work into what I hope is a useful format for designers: a list of eight color heuristics.Some of these echo Nielsen‚Äôs heuristics, which makes sense, because the goal is highly usable color experience. Some overlap a bit, but better minds than mine have heuristics which do the same. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a start.Colors should not confuse or distract. Color should draw attention where it needs to be and where appropriate, share honest, accurate information.Much of color‚Äôs power lies in engaging preattentive processing. Preattentive processing is the sensory awareness we experience before we consciously pay attention to it. Before we turn the sensation into linguistic knowledge we can share or deliberately respond to, in other words.A bright color draws the eye, so we color our calls to action brightly. A dashboard shares important success metrics, so we make the charts vivid.The problem is that too many colors can confuse and distract. Testing as far back as the nineties has demonstrated that ‚Äúeven after extended and consistent practice‚Ä¶the presence of an irrelevant item with a unique color interferes with parallel search for a unique form, and vice versa‚Äù (Theeuwes, 1992).Using colors judiciously, where they are relevant but not where they aren‚Äôt, solves this problem. It can actually reduce cognitive load by bringing the user‚Äôs attention where it needs to be, quickly. Using the right kind of color to show good or bad status is enough of a convention that many users begin to make a judgment the moment they see red or green in a chart; so use these colors carefully, where they mean something. Don‚Äôt make a user make a judgment call and then have to reinterpret the chart correctly. Make it simple, and make it better with color.Colors should work for the colorblind. This is particularly important for data visualization. You can test your accessibility with this wonderful color blindness simulator from Colblindor.com.Status colors ‚Äî colors which show judgment, such as good, fair, or bad ‚Äî are particularly frustrating because the two most common types of color, deuteranopia and protanopia, are green-blindness and red-blindness. You can learn more about making them accessible in this article I wrote a while back.In some contexts, color should have excellent contrast. This is typically restricted to typography, but it matters deeply in data visualization as well. Once again there‚Äôs a great online tool, WebAIM‚Äôs Color Contrast Checker. Your chart colors may not be read like text, but good contrast will make them easier to parse.A key audience being undermined by poor contrast are older users, who are an ever-increasing audience. Think about it; all the young people who drove the creation of the World Wide Web are middle-aged now. The stereotype of the tech-ignorant oldster is just that ‚Äî a stereotype. Many older users have been brought to the online world via usable smart phones and tablets. Don Norman wrote about this recently in Fast Company. It‚Äôs a great read, extending well beyond digital design.Color should integrate well with brand and system aesthetics. If new colors must be added to a palette for data visualization, for example, they should suit the feel of the brand and site.I can‚Äôt argue for minimalist color all the time, because sometimes dramatic, exuberant colors are appropriate to the site‚Äôs purpose; but I can argue for Einstein‚Äôs version of Occam‚Äôs Razor: ‚ÄúEverything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.‚Äù Do what you need to do, then stop.Colors should match the culture, age, and any other aspects of your user‚Äôs frame of reference. Many times this is as simple as creating usable, accessible, brand-appropriate color choices. Sometimes it‚Äôs a bit more challenging:These don‚Äôt exhaust the possibilities, they‚Äôre just examples. If you‚Äôre exploring regional color, Xerox created an International Color Guide, which is a great springboard into your research.Colors should be consistent. Use the same color for links, the same color for highlights, the same colors to carry good/fair/bad meanings, etc.If your color carries information, the data should have a backup mode of expression (text, or an icon with an on click, on hover, or alt text value). You might have a blind user, or a user with a rare type of colorblindness. Expect that. Make sure that your text values work on screen readers!Color should have an accurate, honest meaning. For example, using status colors to express simple categories can be misleading; don‚Äôt do that. Here‚Äôs one of my favorite examples of misleading color usage: a chart from Politifact, reviewing the honesty track record of two candidates in 2016.Much more than color is wrong with the above:On the color side of things, here are the challenges:Here‚Äôs my revised version. Both charts are accurate, but which one tells an honest story?I hope these heuristics are useful. Thanks are due: Several areas are the better for discussions with usability researcher and friend Jennifer Ehrlich. UX design co-instructor Meredith Patrick and several classes of UX students also helped me refine my color usability techniques.I‚Äôll be expanding on these and related color lessons in the near future, so stay tuned!Coblis ‚Äî Color Blindness Simulator. https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/Nielsen, J.

"‚ÄúMusic is an experience, not a science.‚Äù ‚Äî a UX case study",UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/music-is-an-experience-not-a-science-b5c303d51a70,Erika Desangle,228,8,1243,"As Ennio Morricone says it, Music is an experience! It‚Äôs part of everyone‚Äôs life. As for me, music brings motivation, joy, melancholy, memories ‚Ä¶ all kinds of emotions. I noticed that music adds color to my day to day activities amplifying my emotions to create an enhanced experience! For example, what better way to work than with a ‚ÄúTum Rakak‚Äù song from Deluxe in your ears, or to drive with ‚ÄúKnights of Cydonia‚Äù from Muse, or to dance salsa on ‚ÄúEl Cuarto de Tula‚Äù from Buena Vista Social Club ‚Ä¶As a UX Designer and musician, being able to bring a unique experience to a user through music is a challenge I‚Äôve always wanted to meet. In this article, I want to share my experience and learnings!I was on a trip in Germany, where I used a carpooling web platform, called Blablacar, and shared the cost of the ride with two other passengers. As I am a big fan of Spotify, I directly put some music from a playlist I made for my road trips.The other passengers really liked my music and wanted to share their music with me as well. After struggling a bit to connect their phones to the bluetooth car system, I could also enjoy their music and their personal stories related to the songs.But what if there was an easier way to create instant playlists that fits the passengers taste and style of music?This problem inspired me to find a solution that would answer music lover‚Äôs needs. You can read about my journey below! (Yes this is a UX UI case study! üòÉ)To better understand people who like listening to music, I sent an online survey to collect quantitative data from users regarding their music consumption, how they share music and create playlists.Here is a summary of the key findings from 40 responses (mainly between 19 to 35 years old):Music consumption:Preferences and constraints:Playlist creation, share music with friends:Then I interviewed eight people, who all had a strong connection to music, either as musicians or fellow music lovers. Here are some of their responses:Knowing these facts, I told myself designing for music listeners would mean designing for anyone‚Ä¶ but at the same time‚Ä¶Designing for Anyone = Packing for a Trip to Anywhere*Well‚Ä¶As designers we all know that it is really important to focus on main users even if at first, it might seem obvious that the user can be everyone‚Ä¶ For instance, Spotify, developed a personas tool to ‚Äúcreate a better understanding of existing and potential listeners‚Äù**.How to design a solution for music lovers, with different music taste, style and consumption, so that they can listen to music together?Another thing that could explain why Spotify succeeds in the music industry is that any user can build his own solution on the platform by adding favorite songs and creating playlists they like. Therefore, the use of Spotify changes from one user to another.How might we provide a tool to help users build their own solution to meet their needs?I then grouped the findings using affinity diagram‚Äôs methodology to better organize data.This helped me define the problem statement and highlight user personas.Most people who like listening to music prefer to leave their device for free use during parties to let their friends play the music they want. We also know that people who like sharing their music, prefer doing it via a private message or via collaborative playlist. Moreover, finding a specific version of a song can be difficult via only one unique platform.There is an opportunity to help music lovers to enjoy the moment with their friends by providing a tool that instantly creates playlists that fits the crowd, by helping them bring songs from multiple music libraries into one platform to share songs or playlists they like with their closest friends.‚ÄúPassionate music lovers, who like to share and talk about music, need a way to create instant playlists that fits the crowd and the moment, so that they can enjoy a unique time with friends or family.‚ÄùMathieu is my main persona, a musician who likes discovering new songs and improve his music culture.He likes sharing his music with his best friend on WhatsApp. Sometimes, he gets frustrated when he losses a music link sent by his friend. He also gets bored when listening to the same music recommendation on Spotify.Several frustrations came out from Mathieu‚Äôs journey map such as not being able to share music through other apps, to skip songs to meet people‚Äôs music taste, and to find the good version of a song.Through brainstorming, I came up with some features, I then prioritized them into 4 groups using Moscow method, classifying them as ‚Äúmust have‚Äù, ‚Äúshould have‚Äù, ‚Äúcould have‚Äù and ‚Äúwon‚Äôt have‚Äù.The features I decided to focus on will add value to the users by providing them:After creating the sitemap and the user flows, I created a low-fidelity wireframe to test it on people.I got two feedbacks that gave me really good insight to improve my app.Therefore, I decided to rethink the sitemap, take out the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù feature and add the ‚Äúsearch feature‚Äù on the tab bar.After making changes and retesting my paper prototype, I was ready to move into Mid-fidelity wireframing in Figma.I then decided on the typography, the primary colors, the logo and the name ‚ÄúDeepFuse‚Äù.I used Figma for the design of the prototype and Principle to create animated interactions.The user who creates the playlist can choose the label such as ‚Äúroad trips‚Äù, ‚Äúparty‚Äù, ‚Äúwork out‚Äù, ‚Äúget inspired‚Äù that best describes it for sharing with friends. The algorithm can then include songs from alternative genres based on the moment to enhance discoverability.People around can directly join the playlist when they open the app via a bluetooth system, or access the playlist via a link shared by the playlist creator.Users can also create their own playlist. Every participant can add songs from their own playlists already created on DeepFuse app and from the music platform they currently use. Or, they can search for songs, album, artists, playlists, videos or podcasts from multiple libraries (SoundCloud, Spotify, etc.) through the search feature, as what Pinterest does. Therefore, the user can easily find what he is looking for without switching apps.I worked on this project for ten days. I put in a lot of energy, driven by the passion I have for music and UX UI Design, taking a lot of pleasure working on all stages of the Design Thinking process. Doing the interviews and analyzing the survey results, I realized that I needed detailed frameworks to deeply understand the different behaviors forming the music industry consumption. I guess that ways of listening to music change across cultures and countries as well! But still, without having this framework, it did not stop me from going to the end of the process. I am really proud of this first prototype!There is still some work to do regarding the design, as well as the technical part for the algorithm and the API system enabling multiple music source libraries, but the good news is that two developers are working on it!Would you do things differently regarding the methodology used or the decisions I made from the results of the research and tests?

How I learned to be more human at one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs greatest Customer Success event,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/how-i-learned-to-be-more-human-at-one-of-silicon-valleys-greatest-customer-success-event-6b35dcdf01ee,Josias Oliveira,1100,12,1894,"The home of the product experience. This was the Pulse 2019 call.And for being a designer and acting directly with product, it caught my attention. Especially because I work directly with the concept of product-led growth since the beginning of 2018.Today I see that the investment I made in terms of flight tickets, lodging and everything that participation in such an event needs, especially for those who live so far (37 hours of travel), worth every penny.There were 3 days of immersion that were worth as a course or a specialization. It is an investment in education that every design professional or product worker should perform at least once a year.The event took place May 21‚Äì24, 2019 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Namely, the Moscone is the largest event center in the city, where approximately 5000 people were received. This was, according to the organizers, the largest edition of the event and probably the most luxurious.I summarized the catch-ups and insights of the main keynotes. For a 3-day event that I participated, it would obviously be practically impossible to summarize everything here. What I did then was a clipping and I edited what I really believe can help solve the problems that are on the agenda.A lot will be left out ‚Äî and it breaks my heart. But patience, an important part of my job is making decisions. So I decided to show what really caught my eye.But why a designer in a Customer Success event?Product experience takes center stage.Especially SaaS companies, the Customer Success team helps many companies engage and lead customers to adoption. However, this feature is somewhat limited. It is not possible to scale personalized attention to customers who want to experiment or simply have the first contact with the product.In this context the experience in the product takes center stage. It is precisely at this point that the event converges to one of the basic pillars of the Product-Led Growth concept, that is, the product becomes prominent. So much so that the first item addressed at the conference is precisely the importance of Product and Customer Success teams working together.If on one hand the CS team works directly in contact with the customer, raising the main points of pain and improvement needed, on the other we have the product team that has the ability to provide solutions in an efficient and scalable way for the company.The alignment of these vectors results in the improvement of the product made based on real data and pain of the clients, making a connection with the next point that is related to the evolution of the concept of Customer-First, that is, the human vision of the client.Do whatever it takes to create a better experience within your product. The concept of Human-First works hard with the issue of building a vision of community, of integration. It was very interesting that one of the speakers (Allison Pickens, COO Gainsight) spoke especially about the importance of preserving our human characteristics and how we need to make the right balance of our day-to-day activities.Especially in a high-productivity, high-demand market, addressing these issues sounds like a taboo break. And it really is necessary because we need to realize ourselves as human beings that we are, full of failures and needs.The first step is to understand and respect ourselves as a person. Take time to study, to work, to rest, to take some time off from technology. She even mentioned an example of going to a weekend in a country house with no electricity or internet and how important it is to replenish our energies.The second point is to note that our client is also a human being. In practice there is no relationship between companies, but a human relationship between people. And that these people‚Äôs decisions are based on emotions, much more than logic. In fact, 80% of our decisions are driven by emotions, we use some 20% logic just to justify the decisions that have been emotionally made.Being alive is proof that you can win in business by putting the human being first.Every human is in search or would like to be treated within these values. To create Human-First products it is necessary to follow these principles and put them into practice.It seems easier to talk than to do, but these concepts are critical to building products based on the Human-First vision.There are some words that are repeated sometimes like respect , gentleness , autonomy .If you could give a hint to put these principles into practice, you would follow these concepts as slogans in your next decision-making.Before we are customers, we are people. We are human beings.In this session, Andy Mcmillian, CEO of User Testing , showed how product teams can combine Big Data with human perception to bring empathy to the customer‚Äôs current digital experience.McMillian said that companies with superior customer experience consistently outperform and perform better than others. According to a Forrester survey (2018 Customer Service Trends: How Operations Become Faster, Cheaper ‚Äî And Yet, More Human) that point to CX trends, the rate of return of customers to companies that perform outside the curve is extremely high. Once again the word consistency appearing as a key factor for business success.Another issue is that consumer expectations are harder to meet. Companies should think beyond channels ‚Äî and in addition to just switching conversations to digital channels. They should focus on providing the best experience based on the type of context and query, including via chatbots, visual engagement, and voice interfaces.First of all companies need to admit that there is a problem. While 75% of organizations believe that they themselves are user-centered, only 30% of customers believe this is the case. According to Capgemini‚Äôs study, this gap between what companies believe and what actually delivery to their customers is what the CEO of User Testing calls the ‚Äúempathy gap.‚ÄùTips for Building Customer Empathy :Good inventors and designers understand their customers deeply. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than just the ones you‚Äôll find in surveys. They live with the design.Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO Amazon.In this talk, Chris MacNamara shared his experience as a leader and manager in the role of VP of Customer Sucess at Glassdoor ‚Äî a site where current and former employees anonymously analyze companies and their management.The perception that employees have about culture and leadership matters. Is very. Putting it in an order of magnitude, first and foremost what matters is the seniority of its leaders, followed by the company‚Äôs culture and the third quadrant financial compensation.According to research by MacNamara, 65% of participants identified that respectful treatment by all employees is the primary unit of job satisfaction.Human-first may not be the same thing Customer-First. On the contrary, as much as it sounds like a game of words, they are completely different concepts and prerogatives. It is important to correctly interpret these concepts in order to put them into practice. Watch out for the hype.Human-first may not be speed first. Steering is more important than speed.It is better to be going in the right direction with things that you truly believe and that are aligned with your principles than trying to achieve results in the short term.Human-first may not be comfort first. Making decisions is not an easy process, especially when it is necessary to make decisions that are seen as unpopular. The best way to get your team members engaged is to be transparent and open the reasons why they made such a decision. Reasons are the key to understanding.Key lessons from Chris MacNamara:The case of Slido is very interesting. It is a very intuitive and easy to use tool and is used at the end of each Pulse talk as a question and answer window. At the end of each talk the audience could ask questions to the speakers directly through the application. These questions were quickly approved by a moderator andAccording to Peter Komorkik CEO of Slido and Jo Massie, VP of Customer Success, 1 year ago (2018) Slido was totally focused on user retention. In order to reach their retention goals, they tried everything to move the pointer: onboarding, surveys, data, processes, customer education, etc. Nothing gave a very expressive result. To really make a difference, they had to change things on the product side.In order to reach their retention goals, they tried everything to move the pointer. To really make a difference, they had to change things on the product side.First because the product team was just running a roadmap. The Customer Success team had the feeling that their voice did not matter to others, even though it was on the front line with the customer. In a few weeks after starting the quarter, no one else in the company believed in the product roadmap.They have created a team called Customer Experience Team, or customer experience team. In practice they connected the engineering team and the customer success team to work together, attacking the major pains, and solving real customer issues.Product Side Changes:Change of mindset in the Customer Success team:The first results for Slido:Customer insights are the lifeblood of user-centric product innovation. To keep insights flowing, you need to continuously demonstrate your impact on the product.Slido was one of the best cases presented in my vision, especially by reinforcing the importance of teamwork as we continually keep the conversation process with clients.Product growth is often thought to be driven by smart growth hacks or the delivery of functionality that is always promised in the next product launch.But companies that dominate providing consistent product growth take a different approach. They have identified a core set of product principles that drive growth reliably, and the continued application of these principles is at the heart of their product growth strategy.In this talk, Ken Rudin, Mr. Director of User Growth at Google, addressed some of the key growth principles that help Google deliver consistent, reliable product growth.Principle 1 ‚Äî Get the first right mile. Focus on activating users on your product, not just onboarding.Principle 2 ‚Äî Growth is a game of inches. Focus on multiple small victories in return for a great single win.Principle 3 ‚Äî Increase product discovery. Gradual progression in awareness of available resources. Do not show everything at once. Add more entry points.Promote features in a contextualized way.Principle 4 ‚Äî Focus on your worst users, not your best. Focus on marginal users, not the most powerful ones. Growth is often driven by churn reduction versus increased acquisition.Principle 5 ‚Äî All ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù needs a ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù. Identify motivations for the actions you want to encourage. People are predictably irrational. Incorporate behavioral science into your product and marketing initiatives.How to Build a Team Focused on Product-Led Growth :As I said, making decisions is not always easy, but it‚Äôs a task that needs to be done. Showing everything means almost the same as showing nothing.I also attended Maria Martinez, Dan Olsen, Ilan Frank, Christina Kosmowski, Ciara Peter, Guilherme Lopes, Jonathan Mildenhall, Emily Chang (author of Brotopia ‚Äî Breaking up the boy‚Äôs club of Silicon Valley), Leah McGowen- other names that were equally sensational.Many thanks go to Gainsight and Nick Mehta for providing such an incredible event and an absolutely enriching experience in every way. The Pulse 2019 was flawless and certainly one of the best events I‚Äôve ever attended. Thank you!",31/05/2019,0,0,22,0,1050,766,10,7,0,1,74
UX for social change: a 5-step app design approach,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/uxdesign-for-social-change-459203b5d3c1,Elena Morawin,27,6,852,"Social change is never easy. Unless you start experiencing the direct consequences of your actions, it is especially hard to break with persistent habits and routines. And even then ‚Äî take climate change as an example ‚Äî we prefer to carry on and pretend the problem doesn‚Äôt exist. Maybe because there is no suitable solution to it yet, or maybe because the solution doesn‚Äôt suit us as users.I am convinced that a solution to enable social change needs to be user centric and create a user experience that sparks excitement.In the following example project I asked myself: What if it was my responsibility to spark excitement within the millennial community to consume news and learn more about the world? And how can a great user experience (UX) help me achieve that?Within five steps I will take you from a user need to a design solution to change our behavior. The goal: Creating an application to change the way we read news and learn about the world.‚ÄúOkay, so what do you consider news?‚Äù someone asked me when I interviewed them for this project. ‚ÄúDoes watching ‚ÄòThe Late Show‚Äô count?‚ÄùTo be honest with you, I didn‚Äôt even know the answer to this question at first. It feels like there is this unwritten rule of our society that news shouldn‚Äôt be too entertaining. But I realized that this is not the real issue. News that are disguised as entertainment are fine, as long as they are true, unbiased and give enough information to form your own opinion. Entertainment that is disguised as news on the other hand is the real problem.Let me give you an example: Social Media makes you think that your friends latest vacation in Thailand is news. Or the fact that some celebrity tried ‚ÄòGoat Yoga‚Äô and loved it. It is an entertaining picture or video disguised as news that‚Äôs the problem ‚Äî taking up your free time, leaving you with no time left to care about other topics.The people I interviewed made clear that they understood this problem. Most of them were just struggling to motivate themselves to change something about it. Also they were already too overwhelmed with information in general. What seemed to help some of them to not lose touch with the world of news completely was a little nudge by a friend or a family member from time to time. Based on these insight I continued my design process.With the information about potential users at hand, I dived into the second step ‚Äî the UX research. I tried to find as many features that spark excitement in users (and me!) when trying to change their behavior or learn something new as I could. I used some of Jacob Nielsen‚Äôs Design Heuristics to help me put into words why the features are so exiting.Discoverability & Freedom / Curiosity is one of the main drivers for people to consume news. Some readers want to simply be informed about what is going on, yet others want to be inspired to broaden their horizon. When it comes to inspiring users especially travel apps offer a lot of great features. For example, the Lonely Planet App ‚ÄúTrips‚Äù: Beautiful pictures, storytelling, freedom and discoverability make using this app a great experience.Gamification & Fun / Especially when talking about mass media and gratification (the positive feeling after you‚Äôve consumed something ), gamification is an important aspect. And what better example is there than the app that has made us fear for our lives ‚Äî but in a fun way! üòâ‚ÄúDuolingo‚Äù is an app to help you learn a new language. It is a great example on how to make a task that requires concentration fun and rewarding. It might seem silly or childish, but that doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî because it works! Here we can see the gratification system of Duolingo: Including points, ‚ÄòGems‚Äô and badges.Reaching personal goals & Reminders / When changing personal behavior it is essential to keep track of personal development, statistics and improvements, like with the meditation app ‚ÄúHeadspace‚Äù. Besides the reminders it offers many rewarding and motivating quotes and infographics:With this research in mind, I continued with step 3 ‚Äî asking myself what my solution might look like and in which situations it could be useful for users. Here you can see a first very rough idea (called ‚Äústoryboard‚Äù):In the next step I continued drawing some key features on paper. This is called a ‚Äúpaper prototype‚Äù:After testing the paper prototype with users, it was time to create a first digital prototype. I used the program Axure for this. After weeks of building, testing and adjusting I had turned the paper prototype into a real digital product:As the last step of my project I created a YouTube video (and the Medium Post, you are reading right now) introducing my project ‚Äî trying to inspire as many potential users as I could:This five step approach hopefully showed you how to tackle any social change topic using UX Design methods! Feel free to share and discuss your ideas for social change ‚Äî and/or how UX can facilitate it ‚Äî in the comments. üí¨",30/05/2019,1,0,13,5,,,26,0,0,0,250
Are users‚Äô preferences about privacy relevant?,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/are-users-preferences-about-privacy-relevant-db573fb22610,Tom B√§ckstr√∂m,89,4,719,"It is a well-documented fact that many users are willing to share information on social media and other platforms, also when it compromises their privacy. There are variations across geographic areas and age groups, but overarching principle is that people feel comfortable in sharing information on the Internet, even when they would not feel comfortable with shouting it out on the street.Many researchers have studied this question; how much information are people comfortable to share on the Internet? I think it is a relevant question in terms of understanding people. We should study peoples‚Äô preferences to understand people. In this article, my question is however instead:Is it reasonable to base user-interface design on user preferences when it comes to privacy?On one hand, users are the best experts. Designers should follow user-preferences in the sense that users are the ones who suffer from bad design. The users are the ones who choose to buy the competitors product when design fails. By designing a product which the users want is good for business.On the other hand, users do not understand design. If you ask a user, the answer is that she/he wants to have the cake and eat the cake, as well as an unicorn. In fact, users do not understand privacy either. People do not understand the risks nor the consequences of sharing information on the Internet.Moreover, it is an unequal playing field. Companies can specialize in extracting information from users to target advertisement and criminals can specialize in fraud. An average user cannot be expected to be an expert in such matters. After all, an expert is someone who knows more than the average user by definition. Specialist therefore always have the upper hand in extracting private information and doing it in such a way that users remain unaware of the problem. The user always looses.If we then go out and ask the users preferences; ‚Äúhow much are you willing to share on the internet?‚Äù What is the point of this question? The user does not know the risks nor the consequences of the threats to privacy. He therefore does not know how to answer the question. I bet that most users do not even realize how uninformed they are. Any answer that the user gives you is therefore essentially meaningless. It is an answer corresponding to his particular illusion of privacy.Even if you would get an meaningful answer, it would reflect the users‚Äô preferences today. But the Internet is still young, people are still learning their preferences, so the answers you get today are old tomorrow. It is a feedback loop; people learn and react from the previous generation of designs. Users become sensitive to the (privacy) problems of the previous generation. Questionnaire-based motivations for design are therefore aiming at a moving target, where the target is responding to the flying arrow.Design of privacy in human-computer interfaces therefore suffers from an inherent problem: We cannot base privacy-design on asking questions from users related to user-interfaces.I propose that we instead base our design of privacy on imitation of human-to-human interaction. It is a form of interaction with which we all (or most of us) can relate to. We whisper our secrets. It is intuitively obvious to us that some things must remain private when talking to our Mums. We reveal some things to our friends which we would not mention even to our partners. We have a highly refined system for keeping some things private depending on the context. We could then base human-computer-interaction on the same models of privacy as we apply in human-to-human interaction. If we can use an already known model for privacy in user-interfaces, then users do not need to educate users about privacy. They already know it.Modelling the privacy in human-to-human interaction is naturally not an easy task. Our concept of privacy is a highly refined system, changing over time and with large variations across individuals. Yet my arguments above lead to the conclusion that this is the best approach.Observe that I do not claim that we should not listen to the users. We should. We should always listen to the users. However my claim is that we should focus on the users‚Äô relations with other people, and not so much on their relation with the Internet and social media. Focus on the users.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,6,1050,700,3,0,0,11,25
3 tips for successful UX Research,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/3-tips-for-successful-ux-research-fd7bc9e740ba,Marnie Andrews,40,3,662,"Being a UX researcher on a team can sometimes feel as though you‚Äôre the minority of the minority. Even harder is when you‚Äôre the first UX researcher in a company. What are some ways to ensure success?Good research techniques are important, but if you can‚Äôt change minds and your company‚Äôs culture, good research techniques just don‚Äôt matter.3 tips:Teams usually latch onto the Acquire step of research: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gathered data! Look, we‚Äôre doing research!‚Äù But a pile of data doesn‚Äôt add any value until you Apply that data to your solutions. To do that effectively, you need to Analyse it.So while you can pat yourself on the back for getting that initial user feedback, you‚Äôre not doing real UX design until you analyse it and apply it.Affinity diagrams are a great way to look at the data in different ways. For one technique on applying the findings to designs, check out my article, ‚ÄúInfusing UX research into design workshops‚Äù.Involve other team members in your Acquire, Analyse and Apply activities to help them develop a deeper understanding and a sense of ownership of the feedback.Organizations will invest in a lot of designers before they consider a researcher. Those that do hire a researcher often don‚Äôt know what to do with them. (‚ÄúBut look! We‚Äôre doing research! We have a researcher!‚Äù). Such orgs seem to expect one researcher to cover it all. As a result, you might get asked to service everyone.On a larger team or at a larger organization, this makes it hard to be successful; you‚Äôll be stretched thin, and it‚Äôs hard to develop a deep understanding of all areas at once. Rather than plunging into it all, try pitching a bottom-up approach.Find the scrum team that seems most open to working with a researcher, one that‚Äôs most willing to make changes to their designs based on user feedback, and work with just them. That‚Äôs right: not the most important project. The most receptive. Getting traction with one team to show as a success story will help win over other teams, greasing the wheels.Teams are most receptive to usability tests because they produce very tangible results. While you may see generative, explorative or evaluative activities as more valuable, starting with usability tests is a solid way to win over the team. As you get more buy-in, you can move up the research lifecycle.When you‚Äôre seeking a new research opportunity, ensure you understand the users‚Äô education, responsibilities and capabilities first. If you want to truly follow the conversation and job shadow while they work, you must have the mental ability to keep up (or at least learn). You don‚Äôt need to become an expert, but getting into some tough technical concepts you can‚Äôt master can slow your progress and diminish how well you understand the user and their needs. Lack of business domain understanding will also limit your credibility with your peers and how effectively you can relay your messages.Try interviewing users or potential users ahead of your job interview. If you don‚Äôt know any, search online for job postings, and then read about the schooling required. Could you do it if that was your job?That said, you don‚Äôt want to be the user. Having previous experience as a user of your product may cloud your ability to empathize with your users in a neutral way. You‚Äôll naturally think of your own needs and may even have emotional connections to solutions rather than researching without bias.Remember: research is hard. It‚Äôs less tangible than the visuals your UX designers produce. Few people understand the value of good techniques. And no one ever prioritizes research time over sexy new features. So selling this culture change can be tough.But if you feel you‚Äôre doing good helping out your users who desperately need you to voice their needs, you‚Äôll realise that any forward motion is good motion.Got suggestions on how to change minds and culture in the name of good UX research and design?

Android MVI with Jetpack Compose,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/android-mvi-with-jetpack-compose-b0890f5156ac,Luca Nicoletti,96,4,757,"This year, at Google I/O 2019, JetPack Compose has been announced. It is stillin an early-exploration, pre-alpha stage.as stated in the official documentation page. And after digging a little into the demo-preview (which you can download) I completely agree with that statement. It‚Äôs missing some basic component and it‚Äôs not ready for production nor for simply migrating some part of a perk project.But that doesn‚Äôt really matter. I‚Äôm more than happy with what we got so far. I had the opportunity to try it out a little and check the potentials of this new way of building apps‚Äô UI.In my opinion, starting with Flutter and then with this library, Google‚Äôs trying to port the web-development way into mobile applications. In Flutter everything is a Widget, here instead the components are declared as functions.This might be a really good start, and will also help to learn Flutter for sure. Once you mastered the idea of building UIs through ‚Äúcomposing‚Äù components, switching to the Flutter (React) pattern is pretty simple. The paradigm behind building component is not so far away between the two.JetPack Compose allows you to declareUI components, including drawing and creating custom layouts.This mean you could have a function which returns nothing ‚Äî literally, the function has no return type:But this function, thanks to the@Composable annotation, allows us to declare a ‚Äúview‚Äù which can be set (it‚Äôs drawn actually) via setContent() of the activities.This is a method that initializes the composable widget tree and wraps it in a FrameLayout.What I‚Äôm planning to show you, is how we could implement MVI pattern using this new Jetpack Compose in a fancy way.Right now, we usually do something like this to handle MVI in Android:We publish through LiveData<MVIViewState> whatever we fetch from a remote or from local storage (cache that data!) this way:Then we observe that LiveData from our activity:The View is responsible to render the UI entirely, which sometimes leads to use logic in the View as well, if-else statements to display or hide something, and that when block, is really frustrating, isn‚Äôt it? Why should the View check the state, and render a state in a different way from another one? The View should receive a State and just render it, without performing anything else (in a pure functional way).What if we can change this situation, giving the ViewModel , or way better ‚Äî the ViewState‚Äî the power to build the UI, and letting the View only render it? That‚Äôs possible thanks to Jetpack Compose.So, what do we need to change?The MVIViewState class will be a little bit different:This class is pretty verbose, and there‚Äôs a reason for it:ViewState should represent the View , so it should know how to render it, right? By adding afunction to the ViewState we force every subclass to define it, that means that every child-class will know how to ‚Äúrender‚Äù its state. In this way, inside the ViewState class, we build our View accordingly to the ViewState . This will allow us to have a leaner View (Activity or Fragment).So, what about the ViewModel class or the Activity/Fragment? Well, the ViewModel basically remains the same:Okok, and the View ?HERE it is! Isn‚Äôt it beautiful?I personally love how the view just became really lean and basically doesn‚Äôt do anything.

Let me explain myself. Those downsides listed above are real downsides. I mean, I would be stuck trying to find out why a click on a component is not working since December if it wouldn‚Äôt be for the Layout Inspector. But since the Viewis not responsible anymore to build the layout, you can easily check how it‚Äôs built. You won‚Äôt have any more hidden loaders, hidden recyclers, hidden custom views. All your user needs to see, will be built into the ‚ÄúView hierarchy‚Äù and drawn on the canvas. You‚Äôll end up having a WYSIWYG.That‚Äôs it! This was just a brief introduction to what I expect it will be the development of Jetpack Compose combined with the MVI pattern in the Android world!Hope you enjoyed the reading!

Creating a customer-obsessed design culture,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/design-culture-1-b27af7150c53,Alex Cuthbert,56,8,1645,"‚ÄúWe have all the pieces, they just aren‚Äôt put together in a way that is easy for people to understand.‚Äù We‚Äôve all been introduced to one or more new projects in this way. As designers, product managers and thought leaders, we try to get to the root of problems. We want to know how things got to be the way they are because that‚Äôs one of the first steps in developing a strategy that addresses the underlying issues. In most cases, the core issues turn out to be not so much about specific problems, but about the shared values, beliefs, and activities that define how teams work together.This series of articles focuses on how to define and roll-out the building blocks of a customer-obsessed culture. Success here is defined by the degree to which the way people work together is driven by the needs, beliefs, and emotions of their customers and what they see as valuable and how these intersect with and amplify business goals. If you are working in this space, you know that you can‚Äôt really design a shared set of beliefs and values or tap a magic wand and create a ‚Äúculture.‚Äù But we can design experiences and set things up in a way that enables teams to develop shared practices and values.It‚Äôs hard to disagree that businesses and organizations should focus on their customers. The challenge is to figure out how to take brand values and company vision and infuse them into daily activities so that they become part of the DNA of the entire company. Design teams and UX in particular can play a pivotal role in these initiatives as the relentless advocates of customer experience.Design and culture are tricky, loaded terms. I‚Äôve found it useful to define them in simple ways that focus on 1) how we work together and 2) what it means to put customers first. Treating design as a verb focuses on activities and how we work together (versus visual details and UI). This intentional simplification sets the stage for shared understanding by increasing accessibility and ownership. Words like principled design, user needs and even customer insights can be abstract for many people. Keep it simple. Focus on teamwork and customer value ‚Äî at least at first.A good first step is to develop a shared set of questions we ask ourselves about our work and our products. Most teams already have questions they tend to ask at different points in the project lifecycle. Codifying these can help set the stage for thinking about more abstract things like values and principles. I led and built up the UX design and research teams at PicsArt ‚Äî one of the top-rated apps in the photos, video, and creativity categories worldwide with hundreds of millions of monthly users (MAUs). PicsArt has an engineering-driven culture and is one of the most powerful, feature-rich consumer mobile products out there. I describe it as Mindcraft meets Instagram, Snapchat, and Photoshop on steroids ‚Äî toss in Illustrator and some video tools too. For each new feature, we began asking the teams to articulate why someone would care about the experience (versus just describing the functionality needed for eng to build it). That single question shifted the mindset from how something worked to why someone would use it.Many companies have a performance-driven culture. At PicsArt, this performance-based mindset came from the CEO down and was part of the culture. The challenge was that teams were running lots of tests without clear hypotheses or controlled experimental conditions. Two interesting things happened when we tried to train up the design and product teams in this area. First, most people didn‚Äôt get it at all. Even after training sessions, workshops, guidelines, and providing templates the hypotheses weren‚Äôt always testable, too many variables were changed, and the analysis wasn‚Äôt clearly supported by the data. Only a few PMs (typically in growth areas) have experience in this area. Experimental design involves specialized skills and many designers aren‚Äôt trained in this anymore. The culture at PicsArt, like many start-ups, was to try things quickly and see what happens. So we started just reviewing the results of tests, asking questions, and trying to help improve the next tests. This worked moderately well.The second surprise was that a couple of the PMs started to really get it. They took the idea of framing experiments around user needs, changed some things to our approach and template, and promoted their version to the broader product team. This helped spread the approach to other teams much more effectively than anything we had done up to that point. It wasn‚Äôt always perfect but they owned the approach and the outcomes.It turns out people listen to and learn from their peers especially when it involves results from real problems (I suppose I should have known this given my Ph.D. in this area). The result wasn‚Äôt that PicsArt became an Apple-like design-thinking culture or a model of a principled research firm. But we did succeed at building on a data-driven culture by enabling a set of behaviors that was informed and not just driven by data. Putting the customer into the equation in any way that brings their beliefs and goals into view can be the first step in developing a customer-obsessed design culture.As you create your design and culture initiatives, I found it helpful to remember that vision, strategy, and culture are related but very different things. Vision on its own is just a strategy without a plan: the big picture but no way to get there. Strategy without a culture to support it becomes just a promise or a wish. What you need for a vision to succeed is both an action plan and a culture to support it.How many times have you heard we have a great product idea, brand values, and vision but they haven‚Äôt made it into the customer or product experience? It really comes down to this one hard question: How do we move beyond talking about the importance of putting the customer first and create a culture where the core activities, beliefs, and values of our teams center around the needs and outcomes of our customers?I worked at Google for about eight years where we came up with the mantra ‚ÄúPut the user first and all else will follow‚Äù. This was a great principle that people could remember but tended not to fully understand. If you asked people at the company what that actually meant to them on a daily basis, there were a wide range of answers, beliefs, and practices not all of them compatible or aligned. How did this work? Did these differences matter? The ‚Äúculture‚Äù at Google worked well despite these differences because we had compatible values and behaviors.Ultimately, the quality of the products and services we create are determined by the relationships, interactions, attitudes, and beliefs of our teams. That‚Äôs why as leaders, we spend a lot of time focusing on design activities, processes, and culture especially those that extend beyond the design team. Our challenge is to have the DNA of our teams emerge from shared beliefs, values, and activities.Culture can eat your best design principles as snacks. Lia Garvin in Building a Design Culture of Inclusion says ‚ÄúDesign is a discipline centered around building empathy for the user; enabling you to help solve problems they encounter, and improve their lives in a way they never thought possible‚Ä¶.People make products‚Ä¶When there are seams in a team and organization, they show up to the user ‚Äî they break the experience, they make things confusing ‚Äî the user suffers from our inability to build a positive environment.‚ÄùA key piece of any strategy is understanding where you are and how you got there. To be effective advocates, we should be acutely aware of the current culture in which we are operating. Different strategies and action plans are required for different situations. But there are also general strategies that can help across the board. The list below is an overview for what‚Äôs to come in this series. It includes the major emerging components of GoDaddy‚Äôs Design Playbook which sets up and empowers teams to work from a customer mindset. I‚Äôll go into each of these in detail in later articles.This general approach represents the building blocks of a customer-obsessed design culture (credit to Uris Decosta Maya, GoDaddy VP UX for this framework). It ties into everything from leveling guides and hiring to design critiques and the KPIs we use to evaluate performance and success. A key element of the success of this work is sourcing material from across the company vs. a top-down approach or one that involve just the design team. Also critical is how these initiatives get rolled out. I‚Äôve seen a lot of great work in this area at some of the top companies have little impact because the initiatives didn‚Äôt deeply impact people‚Äôs daily activities (more on this too in a future article).It takes a powerful vision, C-level buy-in, and alignment with brand to shift culture. At GoDaddy, I have been impressed by the radical promotion of customer-centered initiatives across the company from brand to front-of-site to mobile. The vision for simple, guided, and empowered experiences that radically shift the global economy to life-fulfilling independent ventures is a great one! However, it doesn‚Äôt ensure a culture of customer-obsession or a seamless, world-class product experience. But it does set the stage for it.Success is when we ask ourselves at the start of projects ‚ÄúWhy would someone care about this new feature or experience?‚Äù And at every decision point, ‚ÄúHow is what we are doing benefiting the customer?‚Äù Starting with questions is the best way to draw people in and build a customer-centered culture of inquiry, collaboration, and excellence.Note: Pieces of the original article now appear in part 2 of the series: Creating A Customer-Obsessed Culture: Validating the Why",31/05/2019,0,0,15,9,1012,864,1,1,0,2,141
Building high-quality hypotheses for better design decisions,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/building-high-quality-hypothesis-for-better-design-decision-3a18a8d00038,Giorgio Schir√≤,35,5,673,"A lot of professionals still perceive UX Design more as an art than a science because they are not aware of the scientific processes behind the role.The purpose of using a scientific method is to make sure we, as UX Designers, don‚Äôt base our decision on intuition or guesswork.‚ÄúThe new design hasn‚Äôt improved the conversion rate, according to the data.‚ÄùThe first thing to do would be to analyse the data and figure out what actions take in order to improve, however that is not always the case.When a designer (or a product person) acts out of emotions, the outcome can be to throw the design away and complain about how much of a waste of time it was. Although common, that is not the analytical mindset we look for.Before bin everything, we must carry several tests and use the aforementioned ‚Äúdata‚Äù as the basis for developing new hypotheses on how we can improve our product.It‚Äôs clear that when we talk about UX decisions we need to leave opinions and emotions out of the table.In order to make informed UX design decision, we need to understand how to formulate strong hypotheses and run experiments based on those.When stakes are high, decisions have consequences and making the right design decisions matters.As designers, we are responsible to do our best to avoid bad decisions.The right design decision can help to create the most user-friendly experience, but (even small) bad decisions can lead to disastrous consequences. Although most of the issues can be identified by measuring the consequences of a product after it is launched, that‚Äôs not enough.Try to imagine a poorly designed interface for an aeroplane control panel. A wrong decision can lead to more chance of human error and potential loss of lives.Designers are not prophets. We don‚Äôt act based on revelations or inspiration. We can‚Äôt afford to bet everything on pure luck.Designers don‚Äôt have premonitory dreams about what colour will boost sales. These decisions are the result of a systematic and iterative process of data collection, testings and experiments and the evaluation of the results. That‚Äôs the big difference between Prophecy and Prediction.First of all, designers must avoid the design-prophecy approach by introducing a system where design decisions are evaluated based on evidence.Working in this way simplifies the decision-making process, because new features can be designed and built quickly and very consistently ‚Äî and it‚Äôs also a scientific way of iterating and testing the effectiveness of design decisions in different situations.That‚Äôs great, I know now how (sorry) important hypotheses are.

Arrays in JavaScript,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/arrays-in-javascript-e64b873ad801,Nikhil Swain,83,8,1231,"In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. It‚Äôs a more convenient way to store and structure information than is defining of lots of variables with slightly different names, like this:Instead of the above, we can use array to structure the data like this:There are basically two ways to declare an array.With the literal notation []With the Array() constructorBasically both the approaches are same but most of the people use literal notation as it‚Äôs quicker to type and less code-intensive.Arrays can be anything ‚Äî numbers, strings, functions even other arrays and within the arrays you can mix different type of data freely.Accessing values of arrays.We can access the values of an array by referring to an index number. Index number can be define as the location of an item in array. To get the value we refer to the members of an array using the index number in a square bracket [].For example :note : indexing of arrays starts from 0 in the above example you can see array[0] alerts the first value of the array while array[1] will alert the 2nd value. To check this you can define an array and use console.table to see the indexing of the array.An array of arrays is known as multi-dimensional array or matrix. These are constructed like this :You can also construct a multi-dimensional array using Array() constructor like this :Items in a multi-dimensional array are addressed in the same way as single arrays, but for the difference we address each item using multiple values, starting from the outermost array. For example, the value of wasp is located at index of 1 of the outermost array, and index 2 of the nested array, so we would refer to it as Avengers[1][2].For better understanding consider this table :We can index an array using strings, instead of numbers. This is often useful when we use multi-dimensional arrays to group related data.We can‚Äô t directly put together an array with string indexes and populate it, for this we have to first create an empty array and then index and populate it.Now, we can reference ‚Äòironman‚Äô as Avengers[‚Äòmales‚Äô][0], and ‚Äòscarletwitch‚Äô as Avengers[‚Äòfemales‚Äô][1].JavaScript provides a number of methods for processing arrays. One of the most useful is the ability to turn an array into a string.The join method concatenates all the members of an array into a string, along with a separator. If the separator argument is omitted, a comma is used by default:Now, together is ‚Äòironmandr.strangecap.america‚Äô, list is ‚Äòironman,dr.strange,cap.america‚Äô and sentence is ‚Äòironman and dr.strange and cap.america‚Äô.By toString() methodYou can also convert the Array into a string by the toString() method.toString method also works the same way as the join() method do but unlike join() which can join an array together by a separator, toString() method join an array by comma separated only.To modify or delete data from an array you must know how to add or remove members from an array. JavaScript provides various methods to add, remove or change data of an array. Some of the methods do the same task but have different approach.So now, you created an array and for some reason you want change a specific value of an array. This can be done by the assignment operator.Now, Coffee is Mocha,Cappuccino,Expresso,Latte.Well this method can be useful to change a specific value but let say you by mistake give reference to an index number which doesn‚Äôt have any value contain any value. In that case JavaScript just adds the value you assigned to that index. For exampleMacchiato will be added to the array at index 4.Now Cofffee is Mocha,Cappuccino,Expresso,Latte,MacchiatoBut this way of adding items in an array is not a good practice. Consider the given exampleIn this you can see we have 4 item in the array and the last index is 3. Instead of referring 4th index to assign the value, we referred to the 5th one. This will create an empty or null value between the 3rd and 5th index.So to add or remove values without any issue, JavaScript provide various method to work upon and ease our work.The unshift() method adds new items to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length.DBZ will now be Frieza,Goku,Vegita,Gohan,Goten.The push() method appends the given element(s) in the last of the array and returns the length of the new array.DBZ will now be Goku,Vegita,Gohan,Goten,TrunksLike push() and unshift() JavaScript provides two useful methods to remove an item from the beginning and the end.The shift() method removes a first item from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array on which we are calling the shift() method.Now Naruto will be Sasuke,Sakura, HinataThe pop() method removes a last element of an array and returns that element.Now Naruto will be Naruto,Sasuke,SakuraNow we know how to add/remove an item from an array from the beginning or end. It‚Äôs time to understand how you can add or remove item from between the elements of an array.The splice() method is an inbuilt method in JavaScript which is used to modify the contents of an array by removing the existing elements and/or by adding new elements.. index : Index, Required. An integer that specifies at what position to add /remove items, Use negative values to specify the position from the end of the array.. remove_count : Optional. The number of items to be removed. If set to 0(zero), no items will be removed. And if not passed, all item(s) from provided index will be removed.. item_list : Optional. The new item(s) to be added to the array.Let‚Äôs remove ‚Äò.Charmander‚Äô from the list.Let‚Äôs add ‚ÄòEvolve‚Äô between ‚ÄòBulbasaur‚Äô and ‚ÄòCharmander‚ÄôThe slice() method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object. The slice() method selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at, but does not include, the given end argument.. start : An integer that specifies where to start the selection. Use negative numbers to select from the end of an array.. end : An integer that specifies where to end the selection. If omitted, all elements from the start position and to the end of the array will be selected. Use negative numbers to select from the end of an array.Original array will remain intact.Now let‚Äôs remove ‚Äòeat‚Äô and ‚Äòrepeat‚Äô item from the array.You can also check whether the item you selected is present in the array or not by includes() method which will give either true or false depending upon the item present or not in the list respectively.Sorting by letter or number allows you to order data by particular criteria. You could order names alphabetically, or phone numbers by area code etc.The sort() method will sort an array into alphabetical order.Now the sorted array will be Gravity,Runaway,Scream,Voices,WastelandTo sort numeric values, we can‚Äôt use sort() method directly. For numeric sort we have to write an additional function :Sorted array will now be 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 25, 1995.JavaScript array reverse() method reverses the element of an array. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.Examples :See here not only the inner elements but the outer elemens are also reversed.For better understanding consider this table :Thanks for scrolling this far.

Living as an Empath ‚Äî when you feel everything and nobody seems to understand,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/living-as-an-empath-when-you-feel-everything-and-nobody-seems-to-understand-65fecce2aa03,"Wan Ting, Quek",30,4,930,"As a counsellor, I never like using the word ‚ÄòEmpath‚Äô. I never knew how someone would react to it and I could not quite explain it in a ‚Äòscientific way‚Äô. But through experience I realize that being able to identify Empaths earlier, made our work so much easier.I am an Empath, and if I would describe myself, I would tell you this ‚ÄúI can feel people‚Äôs emotions. I sometimes take in people‚Äôs pains and illnesses which present as physical pains in my own body. I get exhausted easily when I hold space for people, which I recover through sleep. I like being in nature, and away from crowds. I am hypersensitive to smells.‚ÄùI first heard the word ‚ÄòEmpath‚Äô many years ago (about nine years). As I grew older, learned more about myself and the world and I subsequently started working with people. Through these experiences, reflections and observations, I realized a few things about Empaths:People who are Empaths usually have difficult childhoods. They are highly prone to anxiety, and are likely to struggle with digestive issues. They are often sensitive to the needs of others, but may not feel reciprocated. This often lead to feelings of being misunderstood and rejected, and maybe even feeling that they are ‚Äònot good with people‚Äô. Empaths are likely to be more sensitive to the effects of substances, which can make them more prone to addictions, among other reasons.There is a belief that everything in this world is made up of vibrations. We are constantly vibrating, and people influence each other through these vibrations. Different emotions have different vibrations. To better understand how this works, imagine two tuning forks. If you hit one tuning fork, it will vibrate at a certain frequency. When you bring another tuning fork (that is not vibrating) closer, the second tuning fork will start to vibrate at the same frequency as the first one.So emotions have a powerful impact on others, some more so than others e.g. anger. Imagine yourself in a room with an angry man, most people would be able to tell that he is angry through observing the body language e.g. a tense and tight body, clenched fists, tight jaws, flushed face and shallow breaths etc. Some might even feel his anger.Empaths primarily experience the world through (emotions and) the body. They are likely to have heightened senses, with the ability to absorb emotions. Thus in the above scenario, an Empath will likely notice the physical signs of anger and also feel the person‚Äôs anger as if it were their own. They may also experience in their own body, bodily sensations such as a tight chest, a clenched feeling in the solar plexus, a queasy feeling in the abdomen etc. Without learning to release these emotions, they may continue to stay in the body and subsequently manifest as physical symptoms or pains.What this also mean is that Empaths are likely to experience emotions at a much higher intensity than others. Thus, it is imperative for them to learn to work with emotions and the body, rather than suppress or ignore them.Sometimes Empaths may feel certain emotions out of the blue. They may also be prone to headaches and find themselves with mysterious body aches. These are often due to them subconsciously picking up emotions from others. Thus, large crowds tend to be overwhelming.Currently, there is a lot of sadness and pain in this world, and for Empaths, it can be a very painful and confusing time. For a young Empath, they may be feeling everything in their environment, e.g. parents‚Äô sadness. Thus, they may be feeling the parents‚Äô sadness without knowing and understanding, which often leads to a confusing and painful childhood.Absorbing others‚Äô emotions (or energies) often cause much anxiety within the bodies. These emotions and bodily sensations then become overwhelming. Without someone to regulate for them or to teach them how to regulate. Young Empaths often deal with these intense emotions by shutting down or numbing themselves i.e. dissociation.In later adulthood, Empaths may also fall prey to addictions e.g. alcohol, because they feel the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô a lot more intensely while effectively helping them numb these emotions and bodily sensations. It is not surprising to find adult Empaths who are numbed in their body and emotions.But having said that, there is much that an Empath offers.Unawakened Empaths struggle and often live in confusion and anxiety, because they feel everything around them. While Awakened Empaths, know who they are and are able to set firm boundaries. They are able to experience the emotions of others, without getting lost in them. They are able to properly regulate their emotions in their bodies and release those that are not theirs. They try to stay away from large crowds and have a lot of ‚Äúme-time‚Äù without feeling guilty about it.The gifts of an Empath, allow one to connect with anyone in this world, because they literally feel them. That is the gift of being an Empath. That is important, because at the end of the day it is all about relationships.The traits of an Empath is one of many gifts available to us. I believe that we all have these traits to some degree, just that it it a lot more intense for some of us. So if you want to know whether someone is an Empath, ask them this question, ‚ÄúDo you feel people‚Äôs emotions?‚ÄùLastly, whether you are an Empath or not. You are a gift, and you have something unique that only you possess. What is it that hides within, that yearns to be seen and received?Blessings to you.",30/05/2019,3,0,2,29,1050,614,1,0,0,0,215
Don‚Äôt Wait Until 70 To Retire. Here‚Äôs Why.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/dont-wait-until-70-to-retire-here-s-why-a39eebdac7a,RogerKay,675,6,1282,"Is it better to start taking Social Security at 62, 66, or 70?Work for a lifetime, and before you know it, you‚Äôre staring at your final productive years. I‚Äôve been a tech analyst for decades, involved with tech one way or another since 1970, covering companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Apple almost since they were founded.But all this tech talk gets old. You see the same things, if not in circles, then in spirals; if not in mirror images, then in familiar reflections.The analysts I consider my peers and I are all in our 60s. A late family-starter, I still have a couple more years of college bills, which come with a requirement to remain pretty active. But retirement looms.I found myself wondering, when exactly should I retire? And close behind that thought came a second: when should I start taking Social Security?At the University of Chicago Business School, where I took my MBA, we were great modelers, and so model Social Security I did, using a wide range of assumptions. I looked at three key ages: 62, 66, and 70; four interest rate assumptions for cash-flow discounting: 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. And two end dates, calculated with assumptions about both the solvency of the U.S. Social Security Administration and my own longevity. My tool was a simple spreadsheet.The ages are key:62 ‚Äî which I was when I first wrote this up ‚Äî is when you can actually start taking Social Security. You get less forever after, but you can start drawing.As of the moment, 66 represents the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 100% age, when payments are what they‚Äôre supposed to be. That‚Äôs one year older than it used to be, and younger than it will be for later cohorts.And 70 represents the age when payments reach their maximum. If you can wait that long, you get more.Social Security has served the next-older cohort ‚Äî the World War II generation ‚Äî quite well. That group, which draws most of its benefits from current tax receipts, has benefited from my group, the large Baby Boom generation, paying into the system at record rates. We, on the other hand, will be dependent on future receipts from X-Gens on down, who won‚Äôt be paying in enough to keep us whole. At some point, payments will have to be reduced. The stretching of age requirements is one way the system has already been tweaked.Addressing the end date for the stream of payments, I looked at two different reports that each gave an estimate of when ‚Äî 2031 and 2037 ‚Äî the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money if no reforms were enacted. The trust fund holds the surplus that the Boomers piled up as our large group worked and deposited more than the retirees were taking out. As of 2018, payouts exceeded receipts, and the trust began to shrink, as it will continue to do until it disappears.It‚Äôs not like there will be funds one day and the spigot will clang shut the next. Sometime before the trust actually runs out of money, some brave soul in government will step up and enact reforms that will allow payments to continue at reduced rates. At the moment, it looks like, with no trust to supplement current receipts, the payout would be about 75 cents on the dollar.Addressing my own longevity, my postulates line up neatly with the reports‚Äô end dates. In 2031, I would be 78, which happens to be the mean age at death of an American male. In 2037, I would be 84. My father lived until 90, and his father lived until 80. So, 84 is pretty close to the mean for my own family. Good enough.These hypotheses allow me to simplify the model: payments will continue as they are until they stop. Which gains additional philosophical robustness in that it can apply equally to the system and individual. The system may stop, but I may stop first. I will cease, but something else will continue. Less apr√®s moi, le deluge; more not with a bang, but a whimper.What is most interesting to me in the model, however, is the interest rate assumption. At Chicago, we plugged the cost of capital into everything. It was always called Greek letter œÅ (‚Äúrho‚Äù), the cost of capital. Now, lazy people like me just used the interest rate as a proxy for the cost of capital, and it‚Äôs way beyond the scope of this column to talk about why that may or may not be a solid move. But what even is the interest rate? Is it the lending rate, the borrowing rate, the interbank rate, some other arbitrary rate set in London, or what capital actually costs you?One uses œÅ as a means to discount the value of money between periods; that is, over time. The basic idea is that a dollar today is worth more than the promise of a dollar tomorrow. That‚Äôs intuitive. But how much more?To manage this question, I used the four assumptions noted above. Those savers among you may have noted that your bank accounts are yielding something pretty close to zero. Paranoids in our Boomer ranks might think that these ‚Äúartificially‚Äù low interest rates are a grand conspiracy to deprive us of our rightful retirement, but the fact is the world is awash in money looking for a rate of return, and that‚Äôs the way markets operate: all this demand for safe investments drives the price of money (the interest rate) down.I didn‚Äôt use a zero interest rate in the model because it would yield an absurd result: $1,000 now would be worth the same as $1,000 twenty years from now, and you know that can‚Äôt be right. Perhaps the market interest rate isn‚Äôt a good measure of an individual‚Äôs cost of capital. For some people, having the money now while they‚Äôre still healthy enough to enjoy it is worth a lot more than later, when they‚Äôre dead. So, I used the 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% rates. Folks who remember the Volker/Reagan years will recall interest rates as high as 20%.All that out of the way, here are the results:Using discounted cash flow analysis, and starting the periods at the appropriate times ‚Äî 2015, 2019, and in 2023 ‚Äî when I was/am/will be 62, 66, and 70, respectively, I ran all the numbers, determining a net present value for each stream of payments, a single number to represent that set of assumptions. What they show is that one might be better off beginning to take benefits at each age, depending on assumptions. That is, the model is sensitive enough so that the assumptions matter. For low interest rates and a longer-lived system or person, the recommendation is to wait until 70. For high interest rates and a shorter-lived system or person, start at 62.Interestingly, under the model that shows an end date of 2031, no assumption tells you to wait until 70, the maximum benefit year. And even under the 2037 version, only the 1% and 2% models say take it at 70. In fact, the 2037 model shows a perfect crossover. At 5%, the recommendation is 66, and at 10%, it‚Äôs clearly 62.So, where does that leave us?

Implementing a hexagonal architecture,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/implementing-a-hexagonal-architecture-bcfbe0d63622,Bertil Muth,1300,6,1122,"A hexagonal architecture simplifies deferring or changing technology decisions. You want to change to a different framework? Write a new adapter. You want to use a database, instead of storing data in files? Again, write an adapter for it.Draw a boundary around the business logic. The hexagon. Anything inside the hexagon must be free from technology concerns. The outside of the hexagon talks with the inside only by using interfaces, called ports. Same the other way around. By changing the implementation of a port, you change the technology.Isolating business logic inside the hexagon has another benefit. It enables writing fast, stable tests for the business logic. They do not depend on web technology to drive them, for example.Here‚Äôs an example diagram. It shows Spring MVC technology as boxes with dotted lines, ports and adapters as solid boxes, and the hexagon without its internals:An adapter translates between a specific technology and a technology free port. The PoemController adapter on the left receives requests and sends commands to the IReactToCommands port. The PoemController is a regular Spring MVC Controller. Because it actively uses the port, it's called a driver adapter.IReactToCommands is called a driver port. Its implementation is inside the hexagon. It's not shown on the diagram.On the right side, the SpringMvcPublisher adapter implements the IWriteLines port. This time, the hexagon calls the adapter through the port. That's why SpringMvcPublisher is called a driven adapter. And IWriteLines is called a driven port.I show you how to implement that application. We go all the way from a user story to a domain model inside the hexagon. We start with a simple version of the application that prints to the console. Then we switch to Spring Boot and Spring MVC.The company FooBars.io decides to build a Poetry App. The product owner and the developers agree on the following user story:As a reader I want to read at least one poem each day So that I thrive as a human beingAs acceptance criteria, the team agrees on:The developers meet and draw the following diagram:So the SimulatedUser sends commands to the IReactToCommands port. It asks for poems in English and German. Here's the code, it's available on Github.poem/simple/driver_adapter/SimulatedUser.javaThe IReactToCommands port has only one method to receive any kind of command.poem/boundary/driver_port/IReactToCommands.javaAskForPoem is the command. Instances are simple, immutable POJOs. They carry the language of the requested poem.poem/command/AskForPoem.javaAnd that‚Äôs it for the left, driver side of the hexagon. On to the right, driven side.When the SimulatedUser asks the IReactToCommands port for a poem, the hexagon:You can‚Äôt see Step 2 yet. It happens inside the hexagon, in the domain model. That‚Äôs the business logic of the example. So we focus on Step 1 and Step 3 first.In Step 1, the collection of poems is a language dependent, hard coded array. It‚Äôs provided by the HardcodedPoemLibrary adapter that implements the IObtainPoems port.poem/boundary/driven_port/IObtainPoems.javapoem/simple/driven_adapter/HardcodedPoemLibrary.javaIn Step 3, the ConsoleWriter adapter writes the lines of the poems to the output device, i.e. the console.poem/boundary/driven_port/IWriteLines.javapoem/simple/driven_adapter/ConsoleWriter.javaWe have created all the ports, and a simple implementation of all the adapters. So far, the inside of the hexagon remained a mystery. It‚Äôs up next.When a user asks for a poem, the system displays a random poem. Similar in the code: when the IReactToCommands port receives an AskForPoemcommand, the hexagon calls a DisplayRandomPoem command handler.The DisplayRandomPoem command handler obtains a list of poems, picks a random one and writes it to the output device. This is exactly the list of steps we talked about in the last clause.poem/boundary/internal/command_handler/DisplayRandomPoem.javaIt‚Äôs also the job of the command handler to translate between the domain model data and the data used in the port interfaces.In my implementation of a hexagonal architecture, there is only a single driver port, IReactToCommands. It reacts to all types of commands.The Boundary class is the implementation of the IReactToCommands port. It creates a behavior model using a library. The behavior model maps each command type to a command handler.  Then, a behavior dispatches the commands based on the behavior model.poem/boundary/Boundary.javaThe domain model of the example doesn‚Äôt have very interesting functionality. The RandomPoemPicker picks a random poem from a list.A Poem has a constructor that takes a String containing line separators, and splits it into verses.The really interesting bit about the example domain model: it doesn‚Äôt refer to a database or any other technology, not even by interface!That means that you can test the domain model with plain unit tests. You don‚Äôt need to mock anything.Such a pure domain model is not a necessary property of an application implementing a hexagonal architecture. But I like the decoupling and testability it provides.A final step remains to make the application work. The application needs a main class that creates the driven adapters. It injects them into the boundary.  It then creates the driver adapter, for the boundary, and runs it.poem/simple/Main.javaAnd that‚Äôs it! The team shows the result to the product owner. And she‚Äôs happy with the progress. Time for a little celebration.The team decides to turn the poem app into a web application. And to store poems in a real database. They agree to use the Spring framework to implement it. Before they start coding, the team meets and draws the following diagram:Instead of a SimulatedUser, there is a PoemController now, that sends commands to the hexagon.poem/springboot/driver_adapter/PoemController.javaWhen receiving a command, the PoemController calls springMvcBoundary.basedOn(webModel). This creates a new Boundary instance, based on the webModel of the request:poem/springboot/boundary/SpringMvcBoundary.javaThe call to reactTo() sends the command to the boundary, as before. On the right side of the hexagon, the SpringMvcPublisher adds an attribute lines to the Spring MVC model. That's the value Thymeleaf uses to insert the lines into the web page.poem/springboot/driven_adapter/SpringMvcPublisher.javaThe team also implements a PoemRepositoryAdapter to access the PoemRepository. The adapter gets the Poem objects from the database. It returns the texts of all poems as a String array.poem/springboot/driven_adapter/PoemRepositoryAdapter.javaFinally, the team implements the Application class that sets up an example repository and plugs the adapters into the ports.And that‚Äôs it. The switch to Spring is complete.There are many ways to implement a hexagonal architecture. I showed you a straightforward approach that provides an easy to use, command driven API for the hexagon. It reduces the number of interfaces you need to implement. And it leads to a pure domain model.If you want to get more information on the topic, read Alistair Cockburn‚Äôs original article on the subject.The example in this article is inspired by a three part series of talks by Alistair Cockburn on the subject.Last edited July 30, 2021.

Will translators still have a job in 5 years?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/anthrolinguists-ee8698189210,Michal Kessel Shitrit,25,8,1790,"When I was a kid, back in the olden days, we had a family tradition. Every once in a while, we‚Äôd all go together to the video rental store, argue a lot, pick out a film and watch it together. These video stores were truly magical places ‚Äî aisles and aisles of every cartoon I could imagine (though we didn‚Äôt have imdb back then, so I couldn‚Äôt imagine much). When we finished the movie, we rewound the tape (we were well-mannered kids) and took it back in 48 hours or less. By the time I was in high school, most of the video stores shut down. Instead, we drove over to the vending machine at the edge of town, pressed a few buttons and were rewarded with a thin plastic DVD box sliding out. These days, even vending machines are getting more and more scarce. With Netflix and Hulu on every computer and smart TV, an entire profession has just ‚Äî poof ‚Äî disappeared.Sounds familiar? Being a translator, this is something I hear around me constantly. There are powerful winds of change currently flowing through the translation world, brought on by the rise of AI usage in machine translation. Prophecies of doom proclaim that translation is a dying profession, and translators a breed on the verge of extinction. While I can‚Äôt say I agree with the doomsday approach, things are definitely going to change. In fact, over the past couple of years, the entire industry is swept up in a sense of upcoming transformation: a feeling I personally find at the same time both terrifying and exhilarating.For many of my colleagues, these are scary times. Translators have seen a steady rise in demand for their services over the past 20 years. In 2006, the US Department of Labor predicted a 24% increase in request for translators over the following 10 years. Thanks to globalization and UX trends, more and more companies dove into more and more markets, localizing their products as a result. If you were lucky enough to have a knack for languages and the right training, you were assured a rather safe job prospect in a not-so-safe market. But that cozy status-quo started to crumble in 2015 when the first neural machine translation system went live.With machine translation ‚Äî in one form or other ‚Äî being available for decades, no one could estimate how transformative this was going to be. But NMT and the forms of AI-based machine translation that followed brought such rapid improvement in only a few years, it quickly became clear that the tables are about to be turned. AI relies on big data, and while some languages and specialties already present better results, all of them will get there sooner or later ‚Äî sooner being the key word. As the role of human translators in good-old source-to-target translation continues to shrink, it is up to us to redefine our value and find ways to maintain our relevance in an evolving industry, lest we go the way of the video store clerk.To find out how we, as human linguists, can make a meaningful contribution in hybrid human-machine translation, we first have to consider the characteristics of AI and machine learning, and more importantly ‚Äî their weaknesses.AI-based tools excel in speed, accuracy, and efficiency. In the near future, machine learning will make our lives faster, cheaper, more efficient and accurate. Like the most realistic science fiction ever made, every aspect of our world will be changed and improved, whether we like it or not: from food production, all the way through medicine, supply, planning, driving and even home living. And the contribution it will have to our life does not end with technical tasks. Based on the binary rules it is given- or the ones it develops using the data it is fed ‚Äî AI can produce ‚Äòcreative‚Äô content that is remarkably human-like. Apply a little lipstick and don‚Äôt let anyone get too close, and they will never know the difference. The output will be technically correct and the process generally a great deal quicker than a human is capable of. Have a look, for example, at the paragraph below, produced by Allen Institute‚Äôs GPT-2 Explorer:The first major change to the translation industry was the introduction of the ‚Äútranslator‚Äôs manual‚Äù in the early 1990s. This manual was a major step forward in the translation industry. It was a step forward in the translation industry because it allowed the translator to make a decision about the translation of a book. The translator could then make a final judgment based on that decision.The second major change was the creation of a new translation service called ‚Äútranslation service‚Äù (TOS). This service was created by the translation service company, Translate.com. The TOS service was a service that allowed the translator to make a decision about the translation of a book.Sure, GPT-2 may not be the brightest match in the box yet, and it seems to be weirdly fixated on book translation. However, considering the fact that this was written by a computer, I must admit it‚Äôs quite impressive. The content is grammatically correct and the flow makes sense ‚Äî well, sort of. Actually, some of my papers in high-school weren‚Äôt so far off. And as GPT-2 continues to learn, it may even get to college soon.In fact, on top of translation and writing, scientists managed to use machine learning to get computers to output human-like results in many other fields. Last year, Christie‚Äôs sold an AI-generated portrait for $435,000. Tools like AIVA and Amper Music offer users custom-made AI compositions for their projects. And just a few months ago, an AI-entity named Benjamine created a film starring nonother than Baywatch‚Äôs David Hasselhoff. I know, right? If computers are smart enough to make us some Hassel-clones, humanity can finally sit back and admire a job well done.But these artistic endeavors lack one thing ‚Äî a human touch. AI‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel, or its weak spot, is the illogical things that make us ‚Äî us. Faith, emotions, culture, empathy ‚Äî all of those little, random parts of humanity that make no sense but somehow drive us forward. Without them, the world will feel a cold, strange and alienating place. While people may be able to appreciate the precision and perfection of an AI-written piece, they may not be able to connect with it on a deeper emotional level.The human touch is unquantifiable, undefinable. And since computers can‚Äôt understand it, they can‚Äôt replicate or reproduce it. To bridge that gap, many pre-AI professions will become hybrids ‚Äî with computers doing the bulk of the technical work, and humans adding their own unique fingerprint to create a complete product that is larger than the sum of its parts.In the case of translators, it‚Äôs time to shift our focus from the technical act of translation to the translation endeavor as a whole. The skills linguists are required to have today will soon become obsolete. We will no longer need people to read content in one language and type it in another. Just like a robotic vacuum cleaner, computers will do that for us (hopefully, not getting stuck under the couch quite as often). Rather than being mere language experts, translators will have to become anthropologists of a sort ‚Äî anthro-linguists, if you‚Äôd like ‚Äî students of human nature and culture. Specifically, our role in the translation process will be twofold.First, we will act as masters of humanity: make sure the soul of the content is properly conveyed. This is something I came across recently, in a website translation job we worked on for a major client in the hospitality industry. On top of our usual MTPE duties (because let‚Äôs face it, MT is not there yet), we verified that the tone and voice match those of the brand: inviting, friendly and professional. And it‚Äôs a good thing we did! NMT and similar methods do employ a meaning-based approach, but they are prone to overlook subtle innuendos and subtext. More often than not, the meaning-based approach produced content that was correct, but also dry and impersonal. Sure, it probably would have been understood either way. But it might not have made their customers feel welcome, or delighted, and a lot of the carefully-crafted effect of the original content would have been lost. As anthro-linguists, it will be our job to adapt translations, keeping them in line with the required tone and voice.Secondly, we will act as cultural experts for the target market, ensuring that the result is well-understood, that it doesn‚Äôt step on any toes (unless the point is that it does) and that it maintains the same cultural spirit as the source. Humor; references to pop-culture, history, and books; or even simple visuals are all at risk of getting lost in translation, or accidentally offending our market. An outstanding example of how seemingly harmless content can have a detrimental effect on your brand‚Äôs image is the case of the German brewery Eichbaum. In honor of the 2018 World Cup, Eichbaum printed bottle caps with flags of the 32 national teams participating. But one of the countries ‚Äî Saudi Arabia ‚Äî found their marketing act extremely offensive. The Saudi flag contains the Islamic statement of faith, and the choice to print it on an alcoholic beverage ‚Äî the consumption of alcohol being ‚Äúharam‚Äù, a serious prohibition in Islam ‚Äî incited a heavy backlash from Muslims around the world. Eichbaum clearly did not think their marketing choice will cause such outrage, but an expert in Saudi-Arabian culture could have probably tipped them off, have they taken the trouble to ask.The switching of roles in translation means that linguists interested in keeping their job in the industry will have to acquire a completely different set of skills to stay relevant. Each translation job will involve diving deep into the hidden meanings of the text, using detailed client briefs and a lot of creativity. Translators will need to have an in-depth, broad understanding of their native culture, as well as its many sub-cultures; keep themselves up to speed with any new social phenomenon; And employ various methods of research and data collection to gain insights on the markets they focus on.By using our own human abilities to complement the advantages of AI and machine learning, translators will remain valuable in today‚Äôs disturbed industry. Even more so, we can take an active role in the transformation, helping the translation industry become bigger, better and stronger. And we can be part of the revolution, at the same time making sure the content by which we, as a society, are surrounded preserves its sense of humor, its unique character, and most importantly ‚Äî its soul.Article by Michal Kessel Shitrit.

Fun with Text to Image in Android,Mobile App Development Publication,https://medium.com/swlh/fun-with-text-to-image-in-android-c70046b76682,Elye,51000,4,405,"Have you display any Image in your App? Of course you have! How have you done it?‚Ä¶ Let me guess‚Ä¶What if I say, let‚Äôs load it from TEXT is the other option? What!?Yes, that‚Äôs possible!There‚Äôs a format call Base64 format that could represent any Binary data in Text. This includes any image file (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, you name it).Assuming you have a Base64 Text representation of an image, to decode it back just use Base64.decode as below. And for my case, I‚Äôll translate into Bitmap using BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray.Note: the BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray could decode BMP, PNG, JPEG etc, any image format that is listed in https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats#coreWell, to encode an image back to Base64 format, just use Base64.encodeToStringIn the above, I separate the convert resource to Bitmap found and convert Bitmap to Base64 function for clarity.For the encodeBitmapIntoBase64 function, the compressFormat can be Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG or Bitmap.CompressFormat.WEBP and the quality is range between 0 and 100, where 0 is the smallest size but worst visible result.With the above two, you could convert an image to Base64 text and vice versa. I have an example app which will show the image belowgithub.comThe conventional approach is the Payload is sent with a JSON data that contains the URL that points to where the image is stored.With that the client (device) would need to load the initial JSON first, then only load the image later, which introduce some delay to the image loadWhile that‚Äôs the practice done mostly and seems like the defector approach, there might be times where we only need a small image, and want to ensure it load instantaneously.With that, we might want a way to attach the image with our payload (e.g. JSON Blob), and once loaded, we have the full text and images (and other files.With this, all the needed data would be loaded within a single call. All image is provided together, and no more additional call to fetch the image needed anymore.No. Converting Image to Text is not ideal.Personally I won‚Äôt recommend doing it unless in special circumstances.My reasons would be belowBut for some unique cases, maybe this could be experimented. ü§ûIn case you like to convert an image to Base64 manually, below is the link you could use.www.base64-image.deI hope this post is helpful to you.

Structuring a NodeJS API in an efficient way,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/structuring-a-nodejs-api-in-an-efficient-way-72f7cbd27c57,Tarun Gupta,1300,10,1807,"When you are going to start making an API you would always want it to make it as efficient as possible whether in terms of performance be it overall performance, routing performance etc.. If you have selected Node.js as the platform for your API, then you have made a pretty good selection.If you are new to Node.js and JavaScript and you want to start your journey into JavaScript with some tricks up your sleeve, I would recommend you have a look at my these previous posts:medium.commedium.comNode.js being asynchronous in nature provides very good performance, if you do not require high CPU consumption in your API. For more details on the above point you should give a read to the following article:think360studio.comIf you require high CPU consumption (for example, suppose your api has database queries that take sometime for execution, then every time the query is being executed the CPU consumption goes up which can be problematic in Node.js as node runs on single thread and single CPU core) then I recommend that you to use any other platform, instead of Node.js, you can use Django or Ruby on Rails in such a case.In this article we will be discussing the following things:i) Setup and Install npm and Node.js on your system.ii) Create package.json to list the details and dependencies of API.iii) Install dependencies required for API.iv) Importing the dependencies in API and their corresponding usage.v) Routing Implementation for all the calls to API.vi) Some Additional Tips for enhancement of API.Setup and Install npm and Node.js on your system.To work with Node.js you need npm and node installed on your system. To install npm you can download pre-build installers according to your platform using the following link:nodejs.orgCreate package.json to list the details and dependencies of API.Coming to the point of making a structured Node.js API, let us start by creating a directory <directory>, I am going to make my directory by the name <node-api>.Now go to you <node-api> folder using cd node-api/. Before we start to write our API let us first create package.json file using npm. This file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.To know more about package.json you can visit the following link:docs.nodejitsu.comYou can create package.json using npm init command on terminal and then follow the instructions accordingly.Install dependencies required for API.Now that package.json has been created, lets see what packages we are going to need to setup a basic Node.js API. We are going to need three packages for this API namely express, helmet and body-parser.express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications. To know more visit:www.npmjs.comhelmet helps you secure your express apps by setting various HTTP headers. To know more visit:www.npmjs.comParse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property. To know more visit:www.npmjs.comYou can install npm packages using the following command. For example, to install express:This command will fetch latest version of express from npm registry and install it into you current folder using the folder name node-modules/. Please keep in mind that the above command will install express locally to that folder and it will not be available outside that folder.To install any package globally on your system, you can pass one extra parameter -g to the above command to install the package globally.As I described earlier that package.json is used to tell npm about your project-dependencies. This is how you do it:Using --save as an extra parameter npm will save that package under dependencies along with the version number inside package.json.No dependencies listed in package.json but after running the above command the file package.json looks like following:Similarly you can also install helmet and body-parser. Now create a file called <app.js> which will serve as our server file.Importing the dependencies in API and their corresponding usage.In our app.js we will first require all of the modules that we have installed using npm.Now lets define a port for our app to listen to and make an object on express to listen to the server. This can be achieved by adding the following code to our app.js:Now save the file and test whether your server is working or not by running it on terminal using the node command:It will print ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî SERVER INITIALIZED ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî onto terminal if everything is fine else it will throw an error.Now we are going to use the helmet to disguise our Node.js app as a PHP app. In addition to this we are going to use json method of body-parser to parse JSON data received in requests to the server. Now the code file looks like this:Note: If you are using express 4.x you can use the in-built JSON parser here instead of using body-parser. I had no idea that it was incorporated into express module.Since we have now created a basic server that works, but only prints a string onto terminal when we run the server. The motivation does not end here.Routing Implementation for all the calls to API.Let us continue building this API where we will discuss routing for different API calls, how to create functions in Node.js using the express framework.First of all I want you to create two folders named models and routes. The models folder will contain our files and functions that will process the data received in the requests. The routes folder will contain files that define routes to the functions defined in models with the same file names.Then we will define express middleware inside our app.js to identify(from the request) that to which function in our API, does it refer to.The file app.js looks like following after the addition of the routing middleware.To understand how the above code works lets first create a file named test.js inside models and write the following code into that file.This is just a sample test function that will print This is a test url onto the terminal, when called and send the same string back inside response.The line exports.test = test; enables this function to be accessed from outside of this file.Now create a file with same name inside routes to make route for the test function created above, inside models/test.js. After creating the file add the following code to the routes/test.js :Here we require the file models/test.js so that all the functions exported inside that file are available here. Then, we have created a blank object handle and assigned the exported test function to key named ‚Äútest‚Äù and then we have exported the handle object so that it can be accessed outside this file.This means that we can now access the models/test.js using routes/test.js from anywhere in our API.You might be wondering why can‚Äôt we just access models/test.js when we have exported the function inside it, why is there any need of routes/test.js.You are correct that we can access the models/test.js directly but the reason behind creating an additional route for it is consistency and generalisation.This type of routing helps the user who is going to call the functions on your API. The user just needs to know the name of the file in which the function is present.Now if you will run the server using node app.js and open any browser and type http://localhost:3000/test/test it will call the test function inside models/test.js and will produce results as described earlier.As you can see that our function works fine as it both prints ‚ÄúThis is a test url.‚Äù onto terminal and sends it as response to the browser.Now let‚Äôs understand the piece of middleware code. As I said that user only needs to know filename and function name.On line 13 I store the url called into str which is equal to /test/test in this case, line 15 makes str = 'test/test', on line 16 n = 4 as the name indexOf suggests. On line 17 resstr = 'test', on line 18 pkg_path = './routes/test', on line 19 func_path = 'test'.Now when all the information such as filename and function name are extracted from the url called, the route package is imported using require, on line 20. This means that the object handle that we exported inside routes/test.js is now available here.If everything goes correct then it jumps directly to the if statement on line 24. Here it is checked that the variable pkg is not empty and type of the function name extracted above is a function inside the routes file using pkg.handle[func_path] === 'function'. This is done by passing the function name inside variable func_path by calling the handle method on the required package inside pkg.This was just a basic demonstration of what an efficiently structured API can do. Here only a string was returned in the response and nothing was received in the request. But you can do more than that, you can use this API with any database of your liking and can receive any type of parameters inside the request.Some Additional Tips for enhancement of API.You can also use validators using the npm package revalidator which helps you handle incorrect inputs provided by the users. You can validate the data sent in the request whether it meets your requirements to process the data and produce some results before starting the processing of data. To read more visit:www.npmjs.comThe scope of this article is limited to this because passing parameters into requests and database connections come into another league not in the structure part of the API. Having efficiently structured your API, go along and play with the code more to get a deeper understanding of it.If you liked Node.js or want to delve deep into the world of Node.js, then it is always good to have some coding standards and guidelines that you can follow in order to maintain the sanity of your code and respectively yours. You can read here more about Node.js coding style guidelines. This is rather useful when you are working in a team and following some guideline while writing code makes it easier for you to read and understand other‚Äôs code and vice versa.I am giving away a free eBook on Consistency.

Neuroaesthetics: Understanding Our Perception of Beauty.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/neuroaesthetics-understanding-our-perception-of-beauty-eabf06fc65a3,Yasmeen Masri,63,6,931,"‚ÄúIt is only by understanding the neural laws that dictate human activity in all spheres ‚Äî in law, morality, religion and even economics and politics, no less than in art ‚Äî that we can ever hope to achieve a more proper understanding of the nature of man.‚Äù -Dr. Semir Zeki.The concept of beauty has been one of philosophy‚Äôs most compelling riddles. What is beauty? Is there a single set of characteristics that define it? Is beauty subjective or objective? Is it universal? What about art? What defines it? Does all art have to beautiful?Neuroaesthetics is an emerging discipline in the field of empirical aesthetics that uses neuroscience to understand how we experience beauty in different fields (art, dance, music, etc‚Ä¶) at a neurological level. Questions like: ‚ÄúCan the experience of beauty, a subjective mental state, be quantified and objectified?‚Äù lay at the heart of this novel field.Dr. Semir Zeki, a neuroscience professor at University College London (UCL), has taken a special interest in the neural processes underlying our appreciation of beauty in all its forms. He published a research article on ‚ÄúA Brain-Based Theory of Beauty‚Äù (2011) and gave a TED talk (2012) explaining his discoveries in the field of cognitive neuroscience and aesthetic experience. Dr. Zeki questioned whether the same brain activity occurs when a person is exposed to different sources of beauty and aimed to approach a theoretical perspective for beautiful experiences.A Brain-Based Theory of Beauty.Tomohiro Ishizu and Semir Zeki conducted an experiment where 21 participants were shown art paintings and played music excerpts.They were asked to rate them from 1‚Äì9, least to most beautiful respectively, while having their brain activity scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to keep track of active areas.The fMRI findings showed that, although there were several areas active with each type of stimulus, the part of the reward and pleasure center of the emotional brain called the medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC), was the only region that was active regardless of the stimulus. Not only that, but the activity in the mOFC is directly proportional to the stimulus‚Äô rating (the 1‚Äì9 scale). The higher the rating the stimulus received, the more blood flow (increased activity) was detected in the mOFC. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre listening to a nice song, awestruck by a Van Gogh, or looking at a beautiful face, you will experience activity in the same part of the brain. This led to the formulation of the ‚ÄúBrain-Based Theory of Beauty.‚ÄùThe Trouble with BeautyAlthough this field seems promising in trying to advance our understanding of how we process beauty, not all experts are in favor of neuroaesthetics. Neuroscientist Bevil Conway and Musicologist Alexander Rehding published an article expressing some of the potential pitfalls of neuroaesthetics. In 1993, artists Komar and Melamid asked 1,001 Americans questions regarding their art preferences in an attempt to determine ‚ÄúUSA‚Äôs most wanted painting‚Äù. The result? Something not typically perceived as beautiful.Based on the majority‚Äôs preferences, we find George Washington in the lower mid painting, modern walkers on the lower right, and in front of them two deer seem to be walking on water! Combining everybody‚Äôs preferences into one composition doesn‚Äôt make something beautiful. And for that reason, one thing cannot be beautiful to everybody, doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt beautiful at all.‚ÄúThis painting is so dull, so predictable. It‚Äôs like something you could buy at Kmart.‚Äù ‚Äî Brian Keith Jackson to the Associated Press (1994)Conway and Rehding fear that quantifying beauty would risk creating a ‚Äòright‚Äô or ‚Äòwrong‚Äô criteria for artwork, for both the viewer experiencing it and artist creating it. They fear that this criteria could potentially cause people to equate art with beauty which isn‚Äôt always the case, for example, Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs ‚ÄòFountain‚Äô.Marcel Duchamp (1887‚Äì1968) was a pioneer of the Dada movement; an art movement that questioned what art is and what it should be. Duchamp used commercial, mass-produced, and utilitarian objects called Readymades which defied the idea that art must be beautiful or that it has to be visually appealing. He was more concerned with ideas, not visuals. The experience of beauty in all its forms is open to the interpretation of the viewer/listener himself.They also believe that if we approach this method frequently enough, we would start using science to valorize our subjective experience(s), which can be troublesome.‚ÄúShould we deny someone‚Äôs experience of beauty if the mOFC is not activated?‚ÄùLastly, they don‚Äôt believe beauty to be a scientific field, so why should its experience be quantified and studied? Aesthetic experiences aren‚Äôt and can never be objective; they are always culturally influenced, biologically inherited, or even artificially produced. For instance, a Muslim might find beauty in a mosque more than any other religious place of worship, simply because it has more cultural and religious significance. Another example would be artificially enhancing the experience of beauty with brain stimulation. It is found that the appreciation of representational art can increase by delivering low direct currents via electrodes, called transcranial electric currents, to the part of the brain called the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, responsible for our working memory.About 40 years ago, we had no way of studying the perception of beauty in an objective manner. But today, science is peering through the realms of subjective human experiences, quantifying something once thought intangible. We can potentially measure other subjective experiences like love, hate, or even happiness.Despite the criticism, the research agenda in this controversial field continues to evolve. Everyday, it pushes boundaries, blurs the line between art and science, and explores enigmatic concepts. What are your thoughts on this exploration? Where do you think the potential lies?journals.plos.orwww.thecrimson.comneuroaesthetics.netwww.nature.comwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govwww.toptal.comwww.invisionapp.comhttps://www.whyarewehere.tv/people/semir-zeki/#earthsky.orgwww.the-scientist.comjournals.plos.orgbrainworldmagazine.comwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govwww.artsy.net",30/05/2019,1,0,2,6,861,712,4,0,0,26,86
6 Ways to Increase Your Engagement Rate on Instagram,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/6-ways-to-increase-your-engagement-rate-on-instagram-61e8421e438,Ryan Kucey,211,7,1656,"Three years ago, all the focus was on the size of an influencer‚Äôs audience ‚Äî how many Instagram ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù they had. Brands and marketers alike assumed that with more followers, meant more earned for every dollar spent, or so they thought.As marketers navigated their way through the complex jungle of influencer marketing, a new important metric emerged: the engagement rate (ER).An ER measures how much of an audience is engaged with an influencer‚Äôs content. A low ER is a reason for concern, yet the cause of which could be a number of things.Before I tell you how to increase your ER, I‚Äôll lay out some of the main factors in what can cause it to be low.To calculate your ER, you can use one of the free Instagram tools such as the MightyScout engagement rate calculator. It‚Äôs calculated by adding together your comments and likes and dividing it by your follower count ‚Äî usually given as a result of the average ER over the last 30 posts.While a 2.5% ER for an influencer with 2,500 followers would be considered low, it‚Äôd be considered average for one with over a million followers. That said, let‚Äôs look at some industry benchmarks. Below is a guideline for an influencer with 10,000 followers:Less than 2% = Low engagement rate.Between 2% and 4% = Good engagement rate.Above 4% = High engagement rate.Why is your engagement rate important?Like I said, marketers value this metric and hold it high when assessing what they‚Äôll offer you, or even if they‚Äôll contact you in the first place. A poor ER means they‚Äôre putting their marketing dollars at risk. Whether you use Instagram for business, or for yourself, increasing your ER should be top of mind.Top 6 Ways To Increase Your Engagement RateOne of the easiest ways to grow your follower count is by follow & refollow, which I laid out in my guide to growing your follower count. Although, this approach should not be relied on as your core growth strategy as it attracts a majority of bots and other influencers who are simply just following and unfollowing.I believe building your account to acquire more social proof is important. Having over 10,000 followers gives you more status. Now when real Instagrammers land on your profile, they‚Äôll be more likely to follow you.If you watched my video on how to increase your follower count, you would have seen that engaging on niche hashtags with personalized comments and a strong call-to-action to follow you, is one of the best ways to grow an authentic audience that values the content you create for them.2. Increase the quality of your contentCertainly one of the most important factors in increasing your ER is the quality of your content. Ensure that every photo you post is bright, crisp, and exciting. It‚Äôs also no secret that Instagram captions are key to creating engaging content. The caption you write should also include at least one question (preferably as the first sentence).If you doubt your creative ability to curate high quality content, gather inspiration from other successful influencers. Follow those you aspire to be like and start mimicking the content they create, right down to what‚Äôs in the backgrounds of their photos and what Instagram filters they use. Did they post a photo licking ice cream with one leg in the air, standing on the sidewalk with a palm tree in the background? Great, copy it.While you may not consider yourself artistic or creative right now, you can copy people who are until you yourself are. These are skills that can be developed with practice, not a matter of ‚Äúyou either have it, or you don‚Äôt.‚ÄùYou have the answers to the exam, all you need to do is copy them onto paper.3. Post according to your audience insightsIf you haven‚Äôt already switched your Instagram profile from a personal to a business account, do it now. There are no downfalls to having a business account, nor is it even reserved for businesses. Among other perks, you‚Äôll get access to audience insights. This will breakdown when your audience is most active, providing you with the best times to upload your posts. However, you should aim to post an hour or two before your peak engagement window, especially if that window falls 9PM or later. Reason being, your post will only be seen for a few hours before most of your followers will be shutting off their phones for the night before heading to bed.This way, you‚Äôll allow yourself an hour or two to gain likes and comments, before hitting your peak engagement window where you can then ride the Instagram algorithm.4. Focus on providing valueIf you‚Äôre a student of ours, you‚Äôll have seen me preach again and again on providing value to your audience. I‚Äôve mentioned it before and I‚Äôll mention it again; people do not care about you, they only care about what you can do for them.Family and friends aside, strangers will only be drawn to you if they believe you can provide them value. Be it entertainment, business coaching, fitness tips, or tech recommendations ‚Äî you need to decide what skill set you have that others can benefit from.When your audience looks to you for help and guidance on a particular subject, they‚Äôll naturally be more in tune with your content. I use this example a lot, and for good reason:You‚Äôre a fashion influencer who specializes in providing affordable fashion advice to lower and working class folk. You teach people how they can dress stylishly, without breaking the bank. Your audience loves your content and seeks your advice ‚Äî you provide them value.Yet, most fashion influencers just share their favorite outfits in overly staged photos with straightforward post captions. There‚Äôs nothing that makes that influencer unique and their audience‚Äôs interest in them often stops at appearance.If you‚Äôre struggling to find a way to provide value, begin by becoming a student of your own craft. As you create content and grow your audience, engage in Facebook groups, masterminds, and subreddits. They say you‚Äôre the subject of the five people you spend the most time with ‚Äî why can‚Äôt one of those five be entire communities in your field of interest or expertise?When you feel confident enough to begin teaching others your craft, incorporate it into your content. You can even use Instagram Stories to poll our audience to see what kind of content they‚Äôd find valuable.5. Archive or delete low engaging postsQuick, easy, and straightforward. Sort through your posts and archive (or delete) any that either doesn‚Äôt fit the aesthetic of your page, or received low engagement. This will instantly increase your ER as these posts will no longer be skewing your numbers.6. Use niche hashtagsYou likely use hashtags already, but how much thought do you give to which ones you use? The reason hashtags work for some people is because they either already have a large account and can show up in the ‚ÄòTop Posts‚Äô for that niche, or they‚Äôre smart and choosing niche hashtags.Create a bank of 3‚Äì5 separate lists of 30 hashtags and save them in your phone‚Äôs notes or in Google Drive. Immediately after you upload a post, paste them into the first comment.When building your bank of hashtags, focus on those with between 50,000 and 500,000 unique tags, as in, the number of times those hashtags have been used in a comment or post. If you select only those that have been used millions of times, you‚Äôll only show up in ‚ÄòRecent‚Äô for a few minutes before you‚Äôre too far down the feed for anyone to find you.I‚Äôll actually share with you one set of 30 hashtags that we use, here you go:#instagramtips #instagrammer #instagramfollowers #instagramarketing #digitalmarketing #socialmediahelp #contentstrategy #socialmediatip #socialmediamarketingtips #socialmediamanager #growthhacking #socialmediatools #influencerswanted #brandambassdorswanted #microinfluencer #influenceragency #influencerstyle #influencerlife #instainfluencer #discoverunder5k #discoverunder50k #discoverunder10k #discoverunder100k #lblogger #brandinfluencer #digitalinfluencer #digitalmarketingtips #socialmediaguru #socialmediamarketing #marketing1017. BONUS: Join engagement pods*Engagement pods are Direct Message (DM) groups of influencers of up to 32 people, who will each share their posts to the group to have the other members go in to like and comment on their posts.You can find these pods by looking on Reddit or within Facebook Groups. They‚Äôre simple enough to find within a matter of minutes. Ensure that you‚Äôre active in them, liking and commenting on each member‚Äôs posts.While these can be effective, they do have their downfalls. It‚Äôs common practice to post generic comments like ‚ÄúOMG I need this‚Äù on group member‚Äôs sponsored posts, which is easily spotted by brands. When the only people commenting on a post are other influencers, it‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre active in engagement pods.They‚Äôll also be time consuming as you‚Äôll often have to like and comment on dozens of posts each day. Who wants to open their Instagram app and find that they have 87 posts that they need to like and comment on? Not I. If I were you, I‚Äôd only use them to kickstart your growth and then ditch them once you have momentum.What‚Äôs the buzz around Instagram automation tools?Don‚Äôt. Did Instagrammers not learn their lesson when Instagram banned millions of accounts for buying likes and comments? These Instagram bot automation tools are not only expensive, they don‚Äôt guarantee any results and are often run by 17 year old, self-proclaimed marketing gurus. They‚Äôre also against Instagram‚Äôs Terms of Service, which means there‚Äôs a high risk of getting caught in one of their mass account cleanups they do a few times per year.How would you like to spend all the money and time growing an Instagram account through automation tools, only to open the app one day and see your account was banned? I don‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôd find that enjoyable.Becoming an influencer is something worth putting the time and effort into. It holds potential to earn you more than a 9‚Äì5, in a fraction of the time. Soak up as much information as you can online, put these practices into place, and have patience.",30/05/2019,3,0,10,4,800,450,1,2,0,2,295
The (dirty) business of yoga,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-dirty-business-of-yoga-8f05666b6f80,Ruth Estelle,126,4,843,"CONFESSIONS OF AN EX-YOGA TEACHEREarly in my yoga teaching career a student asked me if I was ‚Äòtoo spiritual for money‚Äô. What she was asking was: if yoga was essentially a spiritual pursuit, why was I charging for classes? She was only half-joking.I‚Äôm no lover of capitalism, but I do have to survive in this society, so, yes, I charged for classes.Yoga has had a bumpy transition from its home (of thousands of years) in India to the entrepreneurial West.There were some very tricky attitudes to navigate when I began teaching in the 90s, and thanks to IT yogis and yoginis, it‚Äôs even more complicated these days.An Indian yoga student told me that once upon a time in India, a yoga teacher would be paid in kind: food, cloth, household supplies, and sometimes even a place to live. Their community would look after them. And with those basics covered, the teacher would be able to take care of them.My yoga teacher training cost thousands of dollars. The training took several years. It covered anatomy and physiology, hundreds of poses and breathing practices (their benefits and contraindications), basic Sanskrit, principles of Ayurveda, the use and non-use of props, a study of Patanjali‚Äôs yoga sutras, lesson planning for all levels of yoga‚Ä¶and much more.I paid an insurance company thousands of dollars so I could teach without fear of being sued. Because I taught in workplaces, I paid even more.In order to keep my teaching registration current, I paid thousands of dollars to attend courses and workshops every year.Then I paid thousands of dollars for equipment. And advertising. And spent thousands of dollars worth of my time to promote yoga and write newsletters for the national organisation.So, yes, I charged for classes. But not all teachers did.I took on a stint of relief teaching once. Six months teaching a class of about 35 students. The teacher ran the class on an ‚Äòhonor‚Äô system. Pay what you feel like paying. If you feel like paying.I watched as week after week, these students ‚Äî many of them literally dripping with gold jewelry ‚Äî walked out without donating a cent. Sometimes I earned $30, sometimes $45. The rent on the community hall was $90.I wanted to talk to the original teacher about it, but she had manifested a $40k yacht and was sailing away with her husband (who usually covered the rent on the hall).This led me to another revelation‚Ä¶The teachers who taught for free or on an honor system, or loudly proclaimed that their earnings were going to charities, were mostly women with wealthy husbands. They could afford to be generous.There was a constant tension for me‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI had a partner and child to support. I had rent on the place I called home, and often on the venues where I taught. I couldn‚Äôt pay my landlords via honor system (nor with bartered donations from students).When the woman on the yacht returned, I suggested that her honor system wasn‚Äôt fair on ‚Äòcareer yoginis‚Äô, those of us running yoga businesses. She said it would be ‚Äòcheap and nasty‚Äô of me to charge for classes. Then she sailed away for good.So I turned cheap and nasty on what was now my class. I asked them to pay $10 for the hour and a half class. Most of them never came back.On September 11, 2001, I set up my usual lunchtime yoga class on the empty floor of an office building. Eleven thousand miles away, violent attacks had taken place. We were all riding a tidal wave of shock.If my yoga students needed an excuse to skip class, they had a good one that day. But they filed in silently.They lay down in relaxation, and I spoke quietly about peace. And humanity. We all tried to find our balance again.In the weeks that followed, something utterly unexpected happened. My business tripled.I received calls from all around the city. People were stressed. Could I please bring yoga to their workplace? And hurry.Suddenly, I was employing other yoga teachers.Did I ask them if they were ‚Äòtoo spiritual for money‚Äô? No, I did not.Being the lousy capitalist that I am, I paid them as much as I possibly could. They received 75% of the income for each class. I retained a portion to cover administration and equipment costs. The business I created continued for 25 years. The students were loyal and so were the teachers. They felt appreciated for their work and efforts.Yoga teachers in studios are lucky to receive even a third of the class ‚Äòtakings‚Äô.Yoga students in gyms are usually paid a low hourly rate.The costs of training, insurance, and professional development haven‚Äôt gone away. Yoga itself seems to be everywhere. It‚Äôs on your phone, your computer, down the street, in the gym‚Ä¶Next time you‚Äôre haggling with your teacher over getting reimbursed for the class you missed, just remember the teacher turned up. She/he was there ‚Äî trained, insured, informed ‚Äî ready for you.Pay them. Let the teacher inhale deeply, and exhale completely, and get on with the job they love.",30/05/2019,6,0,0,4,1050,787,1,0,0,0,693

NSX-T Security with Ansible ‚Äî Pt 1. Basic Firewall Rules,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/nsx-t-security-with-ansible-pt1-basic-firewall-rules-6aa08c25e226,Matt Proud,26,6,1001,"This article is my opinion and not that of my employer.NSX-T is VMware‚Äôs next gen software defined network stack. Whilst there is a GUI, if your using the GUI to drive the firewall you‚Äôre doing it all wrong. This article will present how to use Ansible to drive the NSX-T firewall in a way that you could use in a GitOps workflows.This article assumes a basic understanding of Ansible. If not there are many videos and article available via your favorite search engine.Using these Ansible modules it is possible to integrate NSX-T into Infrastructure as Code pipelines. Whether you want to use it to build VM rules, container based rules or firewall you NSX-T load balancers, you can use these modules within your pipelines to automagically drive the NSX-T Edge and Distributed firewalls based on minimal inputs. We‚Äôll be building firewall rules in YAML that can be stored in Git, then because the Ansible Modules are idempotent, the rules can be re-applied at any time and the modules will update the configuration in NSX-T if it detects the defined YAML doesn‚Äôt match the configured state in NSX-T.NSX-T 2.4 introduced a newer and more declarative API, which simplifies the APIs calls required to drive the firewall, whilst at the same time introduces dependencies which don‚Äôt suit all use cases today. At the time of writing the declarative API is not supported to inter-operate with the NCP plugin, meaning you can‚Äôt use all the new API features and constructs with Kubernetes or Pivotal Application Service. The modules presented below focus on the original API spec, but as Ansible handles all the boiler plate, the interaction patterns are much the same compared to the newer API. The only major is that you have an extra field for each object to classify it. For example if you have a rule destination based on an IP set, you have call out your IP set name and that it is an IP set.If you want to dig into the NSX-T architecture beyond the firewall, the VMware Validated Design guides are a good place to start.https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/5.0.1/vmware-validated-design-501-sddc-nsxt-workload-architecture-design.pdfThe Distrubuted firewall is one of the best features of software defined networking (SDN) IMO. In legacy networking if you wanted to separate 2 workloads you would need to put them on separate subnets/VLANs and then have a firewall running between the networks. This approach does not scale for a number of reasons, primarily because there is a limit of 4094 VLANs that can be configured on network switches, plus there is a huge amount of configuration overhead to provide layer 3 separation. In the virtualized and containerized solutions, when using an SDN stacks it is possible to enforce firewall policy at the VM or container level. For example with VMs, the NSX-T software is run within the Hypervisor, on the virtual switch that VMs connect to and it is this software within the virtual switch which can enforce firewall policy. By enforcing policy at the point traffic exits the VM it is possible to build out zero trust and micro segmented typologies, where every object can only have the absolute minimum of rules, for instance blocking traffic between VMs in the same subnet that run on the same host.As the name suggests IP Sets are sets of IP addresses. You can define individual IPs, ranges or CIDR style based subnets, up to a maximum of 4000 IPs per IP set.The modules used here are a fork of the official VMware ansible-for-nsxt repo. All new feature have been submitted back to VMware via a pull requests and this tutorial will be updated to reference the VMware repo if the modules are accepted.Environment setupOn you Ansible Control server from a suitable directory run:This will create the ‚Äòansible-for-nsxt‚Äô sub-folder. Then from the current folder make a new folder called config.Now the module and the configuration will be separate, meaning that the configuration can be committed to git separately. Your folders should be structured as below:From this point onwards we will be working from the config directory.In this example we‚Äôll put in a rule to allow everything within the NSX domain to connect to Google DNS.The part1_answers.yml file shown below should be saved in the config directory you have just created.In this example we‚Äôre setting the Google DNS servers as an IP set, so that every source will have access to DNS.As we want to enabled this policy on objects controlled by NSX-T we want to insert a distributed firewall rule. Luckily this is the default type of rule and we will let the rule apply everywhere. If there is a requirement to limit the scope of the rule, the applied_tos section can be used to apply the rule to certain logical ports. Scope and applied_tos will be covered in future tutorials.In this example the source field has been omitted, which means that the source will be set to any. Destination will be the new IP set and it will be an IPv4 rule. The service is set to DNS, which is one of the built in NSX service types.Finally, it‚Äôs good practice to separate you NSX-T manager details from config, so create a separate answerfile file called manager.yml, updated with your NSX-T Manger connectivity details.

India has a $5 billion digital content market,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/india-has-a-5b-digital-content-market-heres-how-netflix-can-dominate-it-6046506d7aad,Marvin Diaz,53,6,1231,"Netflix in 2019 is a one of the largest players in the entertainment industry. Netflix has full scale video production teams across the world producing some truly high quality content. Though I personally think that their content is great, I‚Äôm happy to know that the experts agree with my preference. Netflix productions have won accolades at some of the most prestigious award ceremonies ‚Äî the Academys, Emmys, Golden Globes and even the Grammys. Netflix‚Äôs original content has made its mark on the entertainment world and this is not by accident. Listen to any of long time Content Chief ‚Äî Ted Sarandos‚Äô talks and the importance of original content to Netflix will become clear to you.Since Netflix is a ‚ÄúContent First‚Äù company and makes big investments in original content, it relies heavily on a continuously growing user subscription base to finance its increasingly large content production budgets and good content in turn drives greater user subscription growth. Therefore a growing user base is crucial to the financial health of the company and the recent turn of events does not look too bright for Netflix.Netflix‚Äôs volatile performance on the stock market and Disney‚Äôs entrance into the content streaming market does not help its financial situation. Most recently, Netflix stock fell by 4.5% in April 2019 on account of Disney‚Äôs announcement of Disney+.Netflix cash burn peaked in January 2019 with the long term debt of the company coming in at $12.3 billion, Netflix also stated that it expects a free cash flow deficit of negative $3.5 billion in 2019. It is only logical to assume that these funds are being diverted towards content production. All the more reason for Netflix to maintain sustained subscriber growth figures.With years of sustained growth back on home turf in the USA, it appears that the American market is showing signs of saturation. According to the Netflix earnings report, 7.9 million of the 9.1 million new Netflix subscribers in 2019 came from international markets. This figure may have influenced Netflix‚Äôs strategy pivot towards growing international markets ‚Äî Asia in particular.In contrast to the scarce opportunities for growth in the American content streaming market, India‚Äôs ongoing internet revolution and increasing appetite for content makes the Indian digital content market extremely lucrative and ripe for growth.‚ÄúNetflix‚Äôs next 100 million users are from India.‚Äù‚Äî Reed Hastings, CEO NetflixIndia is undergoing a massive phase of internet adoption, primarily driven by improved mobile network infrastructure and inexpensive mobile data tariffs. With only 25% of rural India having access to the internet, double digit growth is expected to continue in rural areas for the next few years. This first generation of internet users is going to play an important role in the consumption of digital media in India. According to a recent BCG report, India‚Äôs internet users are projected to reach 650 million by the end of 2023. This double digit growth of internet users is slated to continue on its path of double digit growth in 2019. 97% of all internet users use their mobile phone as one of the devices to access the internet.India‚Äôs entertainment industry has been on a trail of constant growth for the last few years with the TV industry growing 12% from ‚Çπ660 billion to ‚Çπ740 billion and the movie industry edging out the TV industry slightly with a growth of 12.2% touching ‚Çπ174.5 billion.With high internet bandwidth, it is only consequential that data hungry applications ‚Äî On demand music streaming, video streaming and downloads will have increased user adoption rates. On average, an Indian spends 6.2 hours consuming online content daily. Spending per month on digital media content is expected to grow by 2.5 times. Only 16% of all media consumed in India is digital, presenting the massive opportunity of an untapped market segment. The youth of the country seem to be leading the charge into the digital domain with 25% of all content consumed by the youth being digital. Strong digital media content growth led video subscription revenue to triple in 2018 peaking at ‚Çπ13.4 billion.The revenue from the Indian OTT market $500 million in 2018, of which 82% was from AVOD or advertising revenue and the remaining 18% was from user subscriptions (SVOD). The Indian OTT market is driven by consumer demand and reflects the price conscious nature of Indian consumers.Though advertising revenue represents a large chunk of overall OTT revenues, spending per month on digital media is expected to grow by 2.5 times by 2020. The burgeoning middle class with larger disposable incomes are expected to drive the increased customer subscriptions.Netflix entered the Indian market in January 2016 and has garnered over 500k loyal subscribers as of 2018. Despite the relatively higher subscription rates, region specific content augmenting international content has worked well to increase the paid subscriber count in India. Netflix India‚Äôs target audience are high income consumers from primarily urban areas. With Netflix pivoting towards Asia and India in particular, the larger market should be addressed if sustained growth figures are to be maintained.The Over The Top market in India is a rapidly growing at an unprecedented rate. The Indian OTT space is highly competitive with different players vying for the attention of consumers using different packages and business models.With the entire Netflix strategy for India built on the premise of sustained subscriber growth, here are proposed growth strategies to ensure that subscription growth rates reach the required targets while customer churn is reduced to a minimum.Leverage the hugely popular activity of binge watching by offering subscribers the opportunity to purchase a 24 hour binge pass which grants them access to a particular content series for exactly 24 hours.Content bundles offered to subscribers limit the access of a user to a curated set of content.Mobile phone only subscription that stream content in limited video quality and stream rate offered at a lower subscription price.Original content has been Netflix‚Äôs strongest tool towards adding the next 100 million user subscriptions.In order to penetrate rural India, content will have to be tailored to appeal towards different segments & sentiments of rural Indian society.A number of local OTT players have rapidly scaled their customer base in a short period of time by utilising their keen understanding of Indian entertainment market.Netflix subscriptions can be marketed by positioning the quality & cost of a Netflix subscription in comparison to the cost of alternate entertainment options that offer the same service (movie ticket costs, TV series subscriptions).The experience of a cinema theatre plays an important role in the entertainment of millions of Indians ‚Äî marketing the idea of ‚ÄúBringing the cinema home‚Äù will not only capture the mind of the people but suddenly make the idea of a Netflix subscription very affordable since the price of a movie ticket is quantifiable, relatable and comparable.The subscription growth figures required to support Netflix‚Äôs content first strategy can be achieved by looking towards growing markets with a special emphasis on India.Rapid rates of internet penetration, inexpensive high speed mobile data and India‚Äôs growing appetite for digital content make the market highly conducive to digital content streaming services.Netflix has carved a niche audience of urban subscribers but in order to ensure that growth figures do not plateau, effective growth strategies need to be implemented to tap into the user base from tier 2 & tier 3 cities.Subscriber growth can be achieved by implementing effective strategies for subscription models, content and marketing.Originally published at https://bit.ly/2HYPAfW",30/05/2019,1,0,6,3,828,505,6,0,0,13,56
A Future in Esports,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/a-future-in-esports-3582ed703c1a,Ryan Cheng,9,10,2205,"Thousands of fans decked in merch, holding tickets to the Staples Center, ready to watch their favourite sport. Sound familiar? Los Angeles locals may say the thousands of fans are seated at the stadium to watch their local basketball team play. However, just three years ago, the Staples Center was filled with 18,188 fans from across the planet watching the 2016 League of Legends Championship Finals. But even that number pales to the nearly 400 million unique viewers worldwide that tuned in to watch the tournament. Give a warm welcome to the newest spectator sport in the industry, esports.Despite being a relatively new industry, esports ‚Äî or professional electronic sports ‚Äî has been gaining traction ever since its creation less than a century ago. My primary motive for dedicating my expert project to esports is thanks to my personal association with the industry, having been an avid gamer since a young age as well as founding an esports company, Aether United, the summer of my sophomore year. Especially after the doubt I received from investors and family members over the potential success of the company, I discovered there are more skeptics who believe esports is just a niche than expected.As such, my initial incentive for this project was to end the long-lasting stigma that competitive video gaming was a sinkhole of time and energy. I soon discovered that these skeptic views have become obsolete as the esports industry continues to expand exponentially, extending its reach to rival those of traditional sports. As such, I realized that esports has already begun challenging those stigmas that I grew up with and faced during my Aether United days. Therefore, for the second semester, I chose to expand my topic to discuss potential issues within esports that must be resolved before they hamper the unrealized possibilities of esports. Most examples used in this paper will use esports‚Äô most popular game, League of Legends ‚Äî created by Riot Games.‚ÄúGaming is not only a compulsion‚Ä¶ [it‚Äôs] a simulation of being an expert‚Äù (Walther 7). Matthew Walther, an author for The Week, is a major opponent against the esports industry. However, Walther‚Äôs claim is hardly a hot topic; Ever since the advent of video gaming in the 1970s with the introduction of Atari consoles and arcade games, mainstream media accused young gamers of being lazy, ‚Äúabolitionists of their own future‚Äù. Early critics may have had good reason to create these stereotypes, but upon reviewing gaming history, it is safe to say video games have ascended those stereotypes.Video games often drive strong parallels with traditional offline sports, even in the 70s. Players couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of school or work to head to the arcades, just like others could not wait to get out to play a game of basketball. Just like offline sports, video games offered players ‚Äúon-demand competition and interaction‚Äù with their friends (Paradise 7). As technology improved and the internet was introduced to the world, video games as a hobby exploded. In Andrew Paradise‚Äôs words, ‚Äúthree core elements [contribute] to the esports industry‚Äôs rise as the next major spectator sport: streamed competitions with organized leagues, professional players that can be viewed anywhere, and live events in major offline sports venues‚Äù (8).What defines a sport? Webster, a well-respected online dictionary, defines sports as a contest or game in which people do certain activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other. Esports is a billion dollar industry that does just that. Roland Li defines each game that classifies under the genre of ‚Äòesports‚Äô as sharing a common theme, ‚Äúthey are multiplayer games where all teams participating compete to win, applying strategy, skill, and teamwork to achieve their goal‚Äù (13).You can get Roland Li‚Äôs book, Good Luck Have Fun: The Rise of eSports hereStill, this does not satisfy the esports opposition. Walther argues ‚Äúthe loosest imaginable definition [for] a sport involves not only skill and competition but physical exertion and at least the possibility of injury‚Äù (4). Unfortunately, his accusation lies far from reality. Anything done to an extreme brings the possibility of injury, and video gaming is not an exception. Timothy Martin, writer for the Wall Street Journal, warns that ‚Äúoveruse risk pile[s] up over the years, as players train 10 hours a day‚Äù (2), which is exemplified through early esports athletes who retired early due to their injuries. Current athletes like Jonathan Jablonowski share their sentiments, ‚Äú‚ÄòI have seen these godlike players winning tournaments, then they have to retire and take a leave because of an injury‚Ä¶ I have this ideal where I have a long career‚Äô‚Äù (Martin 3). As opponents continue to challenge esports, it has already proven its legitimacy as a prominent contender in the spectator sports industry.As a spectator sport, esports continues to draw parallels with traditional sports with its career opportunities. Mai-Hanh Nguyen, writer for Business Insider, separates them into 4 distinct categories: Athletics, Marketing, Event Planning, and Streaming/Broadcasting. Each of these plays a distinct role in creating an exciting environment for fans worldwide to tune in. When it comes down to defining a spectator sport, having an audience who wants to watch your product is paramount. And esports has that audience.Nonetheless, esports has made great strides. Not even a decade ago, supporters of the industry were hard-pressed to prove that esports was not just a niche as a result of nearly five decades of video-gaming history not providing solid success stories. However, since esports‚Äô inception, the industry has taken great strides towards great personal growth. In League of Legends specifically, Riot Games franchising of the North American Championship League has cascaded to successfully merging into mainstream media and the acquisition of established corporations such as Mastercard and State Farm as powerful sponsors for their international tournaments.Resulting from these dedicated investments, esports revenue is expected to reach $1.5 billion by the year 2020 (see diagram on next page), a year-on-year growth of nearly 40% according to Newzoo, the leading statistics gatherer for esports. Interestingly enough, Paradise discovered that traditional sports leagues ‚Äùprovide an intriguing analogy. [The NFL and NBA] were founded in the first half of the 20th century, but‚Ä¶ only became revenue powerhouses in the late 1990s‚Ä¶‚Äù (Paradise). Essentially, our nation‚Äôs largest offline sports took five decades to become the juggernauts they are today; With the fifth decade of esports on the horizon, it seems that a similar trend will be seen with this new industry.During my transition into the second semester of research, Riot Games, the creator of League of Legends, was sued on grounds of a discrimination scandal. Despite all of the esports successes in the past decade, it became apparent that with great recognition, comes great responsibility. As esports grows and more people become aware of its existence, industry shortcomings that could have been ignored in the past must be recognized. I came into the second semester determined to discover the potential pitfalls esports will have to identify and resolve before they consume the industry.My initial dive turned up unexpected results. I consulted Ovilee May, hostess for LCS, the League of Legends Championship League for North America, on the issues plaguing the esports industry. The answer I received from her were unexpected; She brought up an internal issue that has not been talked about often. She informed me that although ‚Äúpopular, esports is still losing more money than it‚Äôs making‚Ä¶‚Äù (May). Upon further research, out of the $900M total revenue gained from esports in 2018, nearly 80% of esports revenue is generated by outside sponsors (see diagram). Although actual transactions earn ~40% of this income, through exchanging media rights and advertising space; more than half of esports revenue comes from sponsors who invest money into the industry without expecting an immediate return.While this speculation provides esports‚Äô with its exponential year-on-year growth, it also creates a financial bubble as the industry becomes increasingly dependant on sponsorship handouts. Ovilee May cautions that ‚Äúpeople [must] begin to start seriously looking for solutions in making money.‚Äù Unlike other businesses, esports does not sell a tangible product, therefore it becomes more difficult to determine whether sponsor speculation corresponds with actual industry value. Nonetheless, the spectator sports industry has a unique niche in how they earn their revenue; Instead of profiting from selling a product, they sell a unique experience for hundreds of millions of people globally. Consequently, esports competition should be transformed into a marketing medium for outside sponsors. As esports continues to expand, esports should look to amass revenue by selling advertisement space to an ever-increasing number of partners.The culture in gaming has always been a source of scorn by gamers and observers alike. From personal experience, a computer screen enables the dehumanization of player interaction, creating a culture where cyberbullying others is expected. As such, many players who do not perform to their team‚Äôs expectations will face intimidation and harmful attacks from their team. However, it does not just end there. With the appropriation of this culture, professional players have received multiple death threats. As a result, these actions have led to many esports organizations cancelling scheduled events such as fan meetups. If the amount and severity of these actions were to increase, the consequences will be devastating, ranging from unhappy fans and lost sponsors, to the loss of human life. As a response, instead of taking a passive stance, esports corporations must actively punish toxicity and publicly display that this behaviour and culture will not be tolerated.Back behind the scenes, CEOs of competing team organizations are hard at work to mould their teams into the next international superpower. With few rules and regulations, many organizations have their athletes work ten hour days, tied to the computer screen and a gaming chair. In Ovilee‚Äôs interview, she was optimistic, ‚Äúeveryone is driven by their love for the game‚Ä¶‚Äù (3). Although passion plays a vital part in any athletes mentality, it is hard to believe that athletes should be working ten hour days. Andrejkovics, author for The Invisible Mind: Mindset of a Winning Team, shares his thoughts, ‚Äúmany organizations are blinded by ambition and force their athletes to work under the veil of ‚Äòwork ethic‚Äô‚Ä¶ Instead, they are facilitating injury and burnout‚Äù (51). Fans often have only one expectation of athletes: to perform well through training and practice. They do not often realize that athletes are also human and need to recover as well. Jared Tendler, the sports therapist at Team Liquid ‚Äî a well-respected organization within esports ‚Äî echoes similar thoughts, ‚Äúit‚Äôs important to preserve the athlete‚Äôs mind, watching a movie or hitting the gym, although not directly influencing play‚Ä¶ these are necessary activities to support high-level performance‚Äù (72). Playing any professional sport requires a balance and allowing an athlete to recuperate mentally plays a role just as important as pushing them through rigorous practice.You can get Zoltan Andrejkovics book on mental resiliance in esports hereEsports has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in the 1970s. Although debating esports legitimacy is still considered a hot topic, esports has already proven itself. Within five decades, competitive video gaming began its rapid ascent to become one of the top grossing entertainment industries. Despite its rough journey full of naysayers, esports has demonstrated its legitimacy as a spectator sport, drawing many parallels with its offline competitors in its structure, career offerings, and business model.As we look towards the future, we must acknowledge that esports is not perfect yet. As the young industry continues its rapid expansion, every esports entity has a role to play in maintaining its success. First and foremost, gaming corporations must devote additional time and resources for improving their business model to create a sustainable revenue flow. Just as important, esports organizations must invest in their athletes to foster a healthy and player-conscious environment to support high-level performance for their athletes to practice, perform, and persevere. Lastly, it‚Äôs up to the community to cultivate a new culture devoid of toxicity.Looking back at my expert project, it is amazing to see how far esports has come. Just as esports has overcome the negative stereotypes bound to its name for years, I am confident that the industry has what it takes to solve these three issues. And when we have, it truly will be a ‚ÄúGood Game, Well Played.‚ÄùWork CitedRedbeard. ‚Äú2014 World Championship Heads to South Korea.‚Äù League of Legends, 2018.Cheng, Ryan.

Why Sometimes it‚Äôs Better to Sell Picks and Shovels than Mine for Gold,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-sometimes-its-better-to-sell-picks-and-shovels-than-mine-for-gold-5c5c7b3aa203,August Birch,15900,6,1309,"How creators and entrepreneurs prosper in good times and bad with this old business model borrowed from Levi Strauss and others‚Ä¶The Levi‚Äôs story is a the stuff of legend. During the California gold rush of the late 1870s, Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss wanted to cash-in on the action, but they didn‚Äôt grab their tin pans and head for the hills. The two men invented the riveted-pocket work pants we know today as jeans. Cool. But what‚Äôs more important is the story of what the men didn‚Äôt do.They didn‚Äôt pan for gold.When you pan for gold you have a slim chance of a big payoff. For most gold miners, they lived a hard life and came home with nothing after betting everything. But if the miners took the Levi‚Äôs approach, they would‚Äôve prospered off every prospector who came through town ‚Äî regardless of their gold haul.Levi‚Äôs sold picks and shovels‚Ä¶ and pants, of course.This important business metaphor may help new startups and creators navigate the waters of their business model. Instead of focusing all their energy on a single moonshot payoff, why not sell picks and shovels. You get paid every time.Server space, delivery infrastructure, protective gear, training software, pots and pans‚Ä¶ the list is infinite.When you pan for gold you gamble the entire business on a single moonshot. One binary product ‚Äî works or doesn‚Äôt. Customers love it or hate it. Picks and shovels are different. The PS business is less glamorous sometimes, but the consistent upside has a larger chance of success. Look at auction houses. They get paid in good times and bad. Auction houses sell picks and shovels, so do credit card processing companies. Credit cards don‚Äôt care what you buy. They get a percentage of every sale, on both the buying and lending side of the transaction ‚Äî double-scoops of picks and shovels.medium.comSure, there‚Äôs a worry our business will become a commodity. If I sell shovels what keeps the guy in the shop next door from selling shovels a nickel cheaper? Nothing.If the two of us have nothing to offer but lower prices, we‚Äôll race each other to the bottom until someone goes out of business. Maybe both.However, there is a commodity killer ‚Äî you. No one can clone you, or your staff. This is the difference between the service you get when you call the power company, versus the service you get when you call Zappos. The power company has a monopoly. They don‚Äôt care if your call gets returned next year. Zappos knows you‚Äôve got ten thousand options for shoe retailers. They work to earn your business through the experience. Zappos wants your loyalty.When we add service, expertise, tribe, history, and loyalty to our pick and shovel model, we become a tollbooth, not a commodity.If someone wants a certain experience they must buy their picks and shovels through me. They can‚Äôt go to Jimmy‚Äôs Discount, Knock-Off, Shovel-Hut next door and get the same level of treatment I deliver.Couple a great experience with clever branding ‚Äî you‚Äôre in the pick and shovel business for life. This is why so many bottled water companies can stay in business, simultaneously. The high-end waters position themselves as the tollbooth business for a certain experience. The low-budge waters compete on price.Costco doesn‚Äôt care if you buy their $3.50/case bottled water. They probably lose money on the water. Costco wants you to keep renewing the annual membership fee (one of their many picks and shovels) and buy overpriced king crab legs, tires, and a Caribbean vacation while you‚Äôre there to grab the cheap water.medium.comBeanie Babies as a college investment? They once were, now they‚Äôre worth little more than the stuffing inside each doll. I wonder if any of those kids made it to college. I saw that one coming.However, the business who sold the protective Beanie Baby collector‚Äôs cases was able to sell the cases without speculating on a single stuffed puppy. Once Beanie Babies fell out of favor, it‚Äôs easy for a plastic company to pivot their package shape to fit the next wave of collectible. And the next.The plastic collectible-protector company sells picks and shovels.Yes, it will hurt when your main cash cow disappears overnight. But people will never stop collecting things. It‚Äôs human nature to hunt and gather. We can do this with our business too. There are picks and shovels in every industry.The fads will come and go, but everyone needs a place to sleep, a place to store their crap, dishes for eating, and jeans to wear while they‚Äôre mining for gold they won‚Äôt find. Let the others chase the tail-end of the dying trends, or bet their entire business trying to create a new one. You‚Äôll be in the back-room counting your pile of consistent cash.medium.comWe can‚Äôt all sell picks and shovels. Otherwise, we‚Äôd have no innovation and no cool stuff to buy. If you‚Äôre an innovator, you can‚Äôt help but build the next widget to change our lives. We need you to keep doing that ‚Äî taking risks on moonshots.But instead of betting the entire business on one innovative product, try adding a pick and shovel component as a second stream of income.Maybe you sell bespoke pickles. You could also sell the canning supplies for do-it-yourselfers who don‚Äôt want to buy a forty-five dollar jar. Or maybe you write a book about the bespoke movement, evergreen for anyone interested in making expensive custom products. If the pickles fall out of fashion and everyone returns to Vlasic, you‚Äôve got the picks and shovels to keep the lights on while you brainstorm the next direction for your business.I‚Äôm a writer.I love writing fiction, but I also have a separate arm of my publishing business that serves other writers. If one side dries up, I‚Äôve got the other side to keep the lights flickering. I sell picks and shovels, as well as innovation.You can do this with your business too. Picks and shovels aren‚Äôt glamorous, but you don‚Äôt have to invent anything either. Many times all you need to be is a distributor of an existing product or service ‚Äî plug and play.I used to be a die-hard believer in the Andrew Carnegie quote about keeping all your eggs in one basket. But the part we don‚Äôt recognize is that Carnegie sold picks and shovels. He didn‚Äôt build a single skyscraper during his working days. He manufactured the steel in all skyscrapers. That‚Äôs one big-ass basket.medium.comWhen we bet a business on a moonshot, we‚Äôve got a limitless upside and an inevitable downside. The pick and shovel approach is more a steady dividend payment, month over month, while the one-shot invention is the lottery ticket.Our customers‚Äô vote is the only vote that counts.When we choose a pick and shovel business (or a pick and shovel component) we do something more important than money. We buy ourselves more time. More time to invent new product lines. More time to tweak a moonshot that didn‚Äôt work the first time. More time to feed our faces before we have to get a real job.Picks and shovels may not be glamorous, but they deliver consistent income. Tell that to the girl who bet her house trying to build the next Facespace.Let the others run around frantic.We‚Äôll be here earning ‚Äî buying ourselves more time to serve our audience in ways that make a difference.

"C++ Rvalues, Move Semantics, and Copy Elision.",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/c-rvalues-move-semantics-and-copy-elision-36d492da5446,Kevin Yang,29,4,746,"After writing my first article on C++on passing arguments by value, pointer and reference, I received many requests to write about rvalues, move semantics, and copy elision. These are most likely new terms to people who use other programming languages and even long time C++ programmers may have never heard of these terms before. This article will explain what those terms mean with some simple and straightforward examples.Rvalues are temporary values. Rvalues called so because they are generally found on the right side of an assignment. They can be assigned to other variables, but they cannot be recipients of an assignment. Examples include non-string literals and function calls. In the following example, 1 and foo()are rvalues. They are used to initialize variables a and b. a and b are called lvalues (‚Äòleft‚Äô values).The following statements cannot compile. 1 and foo() are temporaries. Assigning a value to them is not possible and has no semantic meaning.How do you tell if a value is a temporary? As a general rule of thumb, a value is a temporary if it does not have an identifier or name. So if a value is captured by a variable, it is not an rvalue. For example,Another test you can do is use the address-of operator (&). It is not possible to take the address of rvalues.Rvalues are an important addition to the C++ language because they allow something called a move.Let‚Äôs say there is a big object and its data is being transferred to another object of the same type. In C++ and many other programming languages, this could be accomplished with an expensive copy.C++11 introduced the concept of a move to make this operation more efficient. A move allows one object to ‚Äútake over‚Äù or ‚Äústeal‚Äù another object‚Äôs data.Now obj2 is the same as what obj1 was without copying any data, leading to a very efficient initialization of obj2. The catch is that obj1 is now in an invalid state because its data members were just stolen. For example:When an object of type SomeBigObject is initialized by moving another object of the same type, the move constructor is invoked. The move constructor steals the Foo pointer from the source object and sets the source object‚Äôs Foo pointer to nullptr. This is an O(1) operation and leaves the source object in an invalid state with foo as a nullptr. other's foo object was ‚Äòstolen‚Äô.This is different from copying another object of the same type, which invokes the copy constructor. In the copy constructor, the source object‚Äôs entire Foo member is copied into the target object‚Äôs foo member variable, which could be a very expensive copy.Leaving the source object in an invalid state is undesirable in certain cases, but it is not a problem if the source object is a temporary rvalue. Moving an rvalue can be very useful. Some other types, such as std::unique_ptrs, only allow moves.Let‚Äôs say there is a big object being returned from a builder function.For bar to be initialized, the function-scoped foo has to be copied from the function‚Äôs stack frame into the outer-scoped bar variable, an expensive copy. What if there was a way for bar to just become the function-scoped foo (i.e. whenever foo is used, just use bar instead?). This optimization is called copy elision and is similar, but not exactly the same, as a move.Remember that the return value of BuildBigObject is a temporary rvalue. It will disappear when BuildBigObject's stack frame is popped. The compiler can detect that foo is a temporary and instead of discarding it, it will make bar and foo refer to the same memory location in the invocation of BuildBigObject. That means that when BuildBigOjbect is initializing foo, it is actually doing work on the outer-scoped bar. This magic is called Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO) which is a specific application of copy elision. More on copy elision, RVO, and NRVO here.Breaking down what actually happens, the program first allocates memory for bar and passes bar's pointer to BuildBigObject which uses that instead of foo. Now, whenever BuildBigObject refers to foo, it is actually de-referencing bar. This is logically equivalent to a move, but the intricate details that the compiler performs under the hood makes it not exactly the same.There are a few rules that BuildBigObject has to follow for Copy Elision to occur, which are outside the scope of this article. A simple builder function without any branching like the one shown above should suffice for copy elision.",30/05/2019,0,8,1,7,,,0,0,0,2,149
Investing Inside the OODA Loop,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/investing-inside-the-ooda-loop-17356c4a6ceb,Byrne Hobart,5800,7,865,"John Boyd was a fighter pilot and military theorist whose ideas are immensely influential, both among people who fly fighter jets for a living and people who do much more boring things but enjoy the Walter Mitty-esque fantasy that putting together a good powerpoint deck is in some spiritual sense the equivalent of shooting down a couple MiG-15s.Boyd‚Äôs key contribution was the OODA loop: observe, orient, decide, act. If you can do these faster than your opponent ‚Äî if your OODA loop is tighter ‚Äî you can outmaneuver them and win.Across asset classes and strategies, investing can be modeled as staying inside the OODA loop:This model lends itself to a meta strategy, which is find a level of abstraction on which everyone you‚Äôre dealing with is a noise trader. Like any other strategy, this is a lot easier to identify in retrospect.In 2007, it felt like value investing was both at its peak and totally dead. It had peaked in the sense that everyone who liked stocks that were cheap relative to book value or current earnings had done well for themselves; they‚Äôd been long homebuilders and financials, and seen healthy returns, or they were private equity shops buying up distressed or disfavored companies at nice multiples.But that picked off all the good opportunities. I used to run stock stock screens in 2002 looking for companies that had no net debt, a decent return on equity, and a stock price that was close to tangible book value, and there were plenty of opportunities out there. By 2007, those were mostly gone. At the same time, though, the macro spring had been squashed in exactly the opposite direction ‚Äî there was a lot of intellectual energy devoted to asking questions like ‚Äúassuming GDP growth continues at the current pace forever, what‚Äôs 10% too cheap,‚Äù and not so much energy devoted to the question of ‚Äúin a liquidity crisis, what parts of the economy implode fastest?‚ÄùToday, you can see similar situations on a micro- or macro-scale. Legal cannabis stocks all tend to move based on how soon cannabis‚Äô legal status in the US will move from de facto to de jure. (I honestly could not tell you what its legal status is in Brooklyn right now. At least one of my neighbors is convinced it‚Äôs 100% legal, possibly mandatory. On the other hand, people seem to go to jail for it.) If cannabis does become legal, and we start to see how much gets sold and at what margins, single-company valuations will start to mean more, and the people buying cannabis plays at 8x EBITDA rather than 50x EBITDA will have very different returns.On a macro scale, there‚Äôs a lot of hand-wringing about passive investing displacing active investing and potentially introducing inefficiencies. I‚Äôve done my share of hand-wringing on exactly this topic. But what‚Äôs more interesting right now is that the growth of passive investing changes the market‚Äôs microstructure:My fracking writeup is another attempt to get inside the OODA loop. I don‚Äôt have a strong view on oil prices, but I do have a strong view on how the drivers of those prices has changed. The US shale complex is the swing producer, but shale requires continuous capital expenditures to produce more oil, so the real swing producer is the high-yield spread. Historically, oil has been a cyclical asset, because recessions reduce demand while high oil prices cause a combination of lower ex-oil consumer spending and higher interest rates to avert inflation.Today, that‚Äôs somewhat inverted; an economic slowdown that crushes risk assets will also constrain the supply of oil, so it‚Äôs possible for us to experience an expensive-oil recession. One takeaway from this is that the risk premium for owning oil is a little too high, since it‚Äôs not as correlated with other risk assets as it used to be. But a higher-octane takeaway is to wait for a setup where oil prices drop due to demand concerns, and the supply constraint only shows up on a lag.All of these theses take time. Sequoia spent years investigating the streaming video market before they pulled the trigger. An investor in a single stock might spend a similar amount of time patiently listening to earnings calls and incrementally updating a model until the right entry point arrived. But a diversified portfolio of these OODA loop-driven theses is powerful; it raises the variance in information content for headlines. Most news is pointless, boring garbage; occasionally, a story that moves an asset price by 1% is actually the catalyst you needed to see a 50% move in the same direction.Individual company fundamentals matter. The macro backdrop matters. Flows between asset classes matter. But what really matters is figuring out which of these is getting disproportionately little attention, and then finding a good metric for when it‚Äôs going to be salient again.As it turns out, being inside the OODA loop is pretty boring most of the time. You have fast reaction time, because you‚Äôre training to react quickly to something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. But when the time comes, it pays to be fast.Don‚Äôt miss the next story.

The time I was hacked by Mr. Sh,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-time-i-has-hacked-by-mr-sh-583db12b7d8f,collinalexbell,28,2,307,"In 2017, I zero-to-one‚Äôd a YouTube search site that helps users navigate channels with really long videos using an index on caption data.The search used Solr-6.6.0 to store and retrieve the indices on the caption data. I knew that Solr used a lot of RAM, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to start consuming 15% of my server‚Äôs CPU after just a few days of launching my site.While unexpected, 15% CPU consumption did not set off any red flags. If I were paying closer attention however, the sudden spike in usage should have notified me of a problem. I stopped paying attention for a few months until I started getting emails about 100% usage.Unbeknownst to me, someone used an exploit in Solr-6.6.0 to run an sh script on my server that mines Monero and for some reason they decided to increase their hash power from an unnoticeable 15% CPU to a crippling 100%.Here is an overview of how the script worked:The script was called Mr.Sh and it was infuriating to watch in htop. Every time I tried to kill the mining process, it would just re spawn a minute later. The only lead I had to go off of was the flurry of procs that spun up directly before my CPU went back to being a space heater.I ended up making a screenshot time lapse of htop throughout the cycle and I then frame by frame analyzed it until I saw the curl process that downloaded mr.shI curled in mr.sh myself and finally found how it kept evading my eradication efforts: crontab .

A Framework for Creativity,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/a-framework-for-creativity-ac4e6de4d94b,chris bohnert,288,8,1564,"Pixar is one of the most creative companies in the world. It is also a business; and a successful one at that. Pixar sold to Disney for $7.4B in 2006 and it‚Äôs films have earned more than $13B at the worldwide box office.Businesses need predictability, especially in production. However, the very product Pixar produces is, by definition, hard to predict. It is based on the creativity of a team of directors, story-tellers and engineers. While there is certainly some proprietary technology underpinning the delivery of hit movies, the core product is based on the imagination of the people working on the project.How does a business like Pixar remove risk and establish a predictable production line? And what can all product-driven companies learn from the Pixar approach?Pixar‚Äôs hit-parade is not a coincidence. The company has a framework for managing the creative process of movie-making; which Ed Catmull details beautifully in Creativity, Inc.I believe the same approach works for managing product teams.A framework is designed to systematically help a team through the product discovery and delivery phases. In other words, it helps them determine what to build and guides them as they ship it to production.For Pixar, the product is a movie. But the principle applies equally to software products.Done well, a framework does three things:A good framework doesn‚Äôt guarantee success, but it removes some of the variability in outcomes by ensuring best practices. And it does so without stifling the creativity and agency of the team. In fact, the framework frees the team to focus on high-value discovery and delivery activities, rather than low-value administrative tasks ‚Äî because those are already baked into the process.Here‚Äôs what I aim for in building a framework for a product team.Just a like a widget factory has assembly lines, so does a product team shipping features. Our assembly line is the process by which we move from product discovery to delivery to validation.It doesn‚Äôt matter what epic the team is working on, there should be a consistent process through which the team works ‚Äî like a downhill skier clearing gate after gate. The checkpoints will vary from company-to-company, but some common ones that I‚Äôve used across companies are below.FramingBefore the team moves from the problem space to the solution space, it needs to frame the issue. For me, framing includes the following:The framing exercise should almost always be the first gate in the process because it grounds the rest of the project. The team can refer back to it throughout the product discovery process to make sure it isn‚Äôt deviating from the core problem (i.e. avoid solution creep). It‚Äôs also a great tool for management to gain confidence that the team is spending time on the most valuable business outcomes.BrainstormingOnce a team has framed the project it can confidently move into product discovery. I like to make this a semi-formal checkpoint starting with the PM and designers. In fact, in a small company, I like to make these meetings cross-team, including all the PM‚Äôs and designers. This gives every PM visibility ‚Äî early on ‚Äî what problems the other teams are tackling. It fosters problem buy-in and knowledge sharing before the delivering PM is married to a solution.During the initial brainstorming meeting, the lead PM presents the epic framework and it‚Äôs the team‚Äôs job to challenge assumptions and brainstorm high-level solutions‚Ä¶ the more the better. This becomes the launchpad for deeper product discovery and ensures everyone clearly understands the problem we‚Äôre solving.The brainstorming meeting is also a time for the team to discuss how they will prioritize and validate the potential solutions. The PM and designers should leave the meeting with a rough roadmap of next steps.Should engineers be in this meeting? I think that‚Äôs up to the org. There is absolutely value in getting developers involved in the process early, but I don‚Äôt think that has to be at the initial brainstorming.Solution wallI don‚Äôt like product teams to formally present proposed solutions to stakeholders in a meeting. I‚Äôve found these type of sessions are rarely productive for two reasons:Instead, I prefer setting up a solution wall.A solution wall is a prominent space in the office where teams visually tell the story of the solution they‚Äôre building. This can include problem statements, customer quotes, survey results, storyboards, UI designs ‚Äî anything that communicates the problem we‚Äôre solving and how we‚Äôre solving it. The solution wall is a living organism throughout the life of the project; the team can add and take away as it moves through the product discovery process.Next to the solution wall is a small table with sharpies and a stack of post-it notes. And that‚Äôs where the magic happens.Any employee in the company can view the wall and leave feedback on the post-it notes. This means a customer support rep that would normally not have an avenue to contribute can leave a note regarding a customer pain point they‚Äôve heard on the phones. It‚Äôs a non-threatening and asynchronous way to collect feedback and often leads to aha moments for the product team. It‚Äôs also a natural way to involve engineering in the process. Developers can see what is being contemplated and can pump the brakes if they see something that is technically not feasible.A solution wall drives transparency and taps into knowledge throughout the organization. Employees love contributing to the product process and the product team can collect feedback without slowing down. Win-win.Agile cadenceAgile scrum itself offers a great cadence that becomes the beating heart of the product team. This includes the length of the sprints, daily standups and retros. All of these exercises offer natural checkpoints throughout the life of a project.The agile process allows teams to focus on shipping meaningful products that achieve desired outcomes‚Ä¶ not on the mechanics of how to get the product out the door.ValidationLastly, there should be a formal checkpoint to validate results after launch. The vehicle for this can vary. You could use the solution wall as a way to publicize results and iterative learnings or do a formal debrief meeting to review the metrics (similar to the initial brainstorm meeting). Regardless, validation should reference the success metrics from the framing exercise and must culminate in a set of learnings or next steps.Another key component of an effective framework is establishing ownership. To be clear: the product team owns the solution. While feedback should be solicited throughout the discovery process, the final product that ships is wholly up to the product team ‚Äî and the team is on the hook for the results.Ed Catmull discusses this in the context of the Braintrust meetings at Pixar; candid feedback sessions where the directors present their work:‚ÄúThe Braintrust has no authority. The director does not have to follow any of the speciÔ¨Åc suggestions. After a Braintrust meeting, it is up to him or her to Ô¨Ågure out how to address the feedback. Giving the Braintrust no power to mandate solutions affects the dynamics of the group in ways I believe are essential‚Ä¶. We don‚Äôt want the Braintrust to solve a director‚Äôs problem because we believe that, in all likelihood, our solution won‚Äôt be as good as the one the director and his or her creative team comes up with.‚ÄùThe product team is on the hook to deliver the solution and, to do that, it must have a clear target to aim at. It‚Äôs the leader‚Äôs job to paint the target, which includes the following.Communicate a clear product vision and strategyThe product vision should establish a picture of where we want to go (a big-hairy-audacious-goal) and a rough idea of how we think we can get there. The time horizon should be measured in years, not months.Product teams will be working several layers below the product strategy. However, to enable these teams to make effective, autonomous decisions, they must understand how their problem statements ladder up to business drivers.Marty Cagan from Silicon Valley Product Group explains this in his book Inspired:‚ÄúEmpowered teams need business context so they know how to contribute to the greater whole. This requires an understanding of the product vision and the business objectives.‚ÄùEstablish a sphere of focusProduct teams should be aligned around stable areas of ownership with a clear mandate. In other words, give teams a problem to solve, not a solution to implement.This requires clearly establishing problem statements that teams can rally around. In my opinion, perhaps the greatest problem statement of all time was articulated by John F. Kennedy and led to the 1969 moon landing.‚ÄúI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.‚ÄùJFK checked all the boxes (big target, clear success criteria, timebox)‚Ä¶ and the team delivered!While each team is unique and will create its own norms, there is value in establishing a common set of tools that are shared across teams. This helps establish a common language and makes it easier for teams to share knowledge. Some basics include:Lastly, like any good process, your‚Äôs should evolve over time and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî with input from the entire team. In fact, the teams should ultimately drive the evolution of the framework. However, it‚Äôs important that different teams don‚Äôt evolve in different directions. Some flexibility is desirable, but the power of the framework will be lost if each team ends up operating in a vacuum.",30/05/2019,0,0,10,3,1050,391,2,4,0,5,55
We All Need A Coach,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/we-all-need-a-coach-8f4d79e90fc4,Erik Brown,4100,7,1638,"Some may disagree with the idea that we all need a coach in our lives. Why would the best in the world need a coach? If they‚Äôre the best, others should be copying them.If I‚Äôm the best tennis player in the world, why should I need a coach? After all, I‚Äôd be able to smash that ‚Äòcoach‚Äô in a game of tennis. What good could they provide me?Logically that would make sense. However even if you are the best, a course correction could be needed. Even the greatest could be limiting themselves or those around them.The idea of taking on a coach also requires something humans are intuitively bad at ‚Äî humility. Just by taking advice from another requires you to defer to their judgement. As one becomes more powerful, that deferment becomes harder and harder.Even the simple skill of listening can be extremely difficult. This could be particularly true for one that has achieved high status. In his book ‚ÄúNever Split The Difference‚Äù, former FBI agent Chris Voss, explains that when the FBI negotiates with a hostage taker on the phone, a team of 5 agents listens in to the call. This is how difficult they consider listening to be.Now superimpose that idea on a superstar CEO who has a plan in their head and is being questioned. Maybe the intricacy of the questions isn‚Äôt picked up? Or maybe a question is just ignored because the CEO‚Äôs plan is just ‚Äòso damn good‚Äô. It‚Äôs difficult to see so many variables through one set of eyes. This is especially true when those eyes are clouded with their own self-importance. This is where a coach can be crucial.‚ÄúYour title makes you a manager. Your people will decide if you‚Äôre a leader, and it‚Äôs up to you to live up to that.‚Äù‚Äî Bill CampbellWhat if I told you that Steve Jobs had a coach? You might laugh, just from stories about the man, it would be difficult to see him taking directions. Now, what if I told you Jobs‚Äô coach also coached Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google and Jeff Bezos from Amazon?You might be intrigued. Now, what if I added that this particular person was a football coach? At this point, you might call B.S. on me and tell me I‚Äôm making up a story. However, this isn‚Äôt fiction. A football coach made the rounds in Silicon Valley working for various primetime executives.Bill Campbell, a former football coach for Columbia University, was a staple for high powered businesses in the tech field. As a football coach Campbell left a lot to be desired, but as a builder of teams he was phenomenal.Even though he never wrote a line of code in his life, he was a board member for both Google and Apple at the same time. Although the firms were rivals, Campbell was considered so trustworthy the dual membership wasn‚Äôt questioned.Bill‚Äôs specialty wasn‚Äôt only business focused. His advice was more people centered; something superstar CEO‚Äôs could easily lose focus on. His ‚Äòplayers‚Äô could come to him for business advice or just life advice.Ben Horowitz, founder of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz described Campbell as a friend who you could call when things go horribly wrong or when something goes well and you need somebody to be excited for you.Campbell encouraged his tech players to judge people by more than just numerical metrics and would come up with systems to do it. He‚Äôd never take credit for any good decisions he helped his players develop. You‚Äôd also never find him in a beautiful office. He worked from a table at a bar in Silicon Valley.By doing all these things, Campbell never took the spotlight off the high powered individuals he coached. In an interview with Eric Schmidt on the Jordan Harbinger Podcast, the former CEO of Google described Bill Campbell‚Äôs funeral. Schmidt said at least a thousand people were there that claimed Campbell was their coach. But, the Campbell story is only one instance of high performers seeking a coach.In Alex Banyan‚Äôs book The Third Door, he interviews Pitbull. Strangely, the rapper got more excited talking about a meeting with Carlos Slim than music. According to Forbes, Slim is one of the richest men in the world. Pitbull offered to fetch coffee and run errands for Slim just so he could spend time around the tycoon and learn something.Despite being a world renowned music star, Pitbull was willing to have the humility be coached ‚Äî even to work as an intern. It didn‚Äôt matter that he had number one songs and money, he realized there was more for him to learn.I‚Äôm a do-it-yourself kind of person. I often find it frustrating to work with others. However, I‚Äôve benefited greatly from coaching.I started doing martial arts in my early 20‚Äôs and was completely not a fit for it. I was bulky and stiff. I‚Äôd never really competed in any kind of sports. I was a complete klutz and had terrible footwork. Just the type of guy who shouldn‚Äôt be doing martial arts. I‚Äôm sure just having me in a school sent insurance liability rates skyrocketing.Through complete dumb luck, I happened to walk into the class of one of the best martial arts instructors who ever lived. What made my instructor good wasn‚Äôt his amazing martial arts abilities. It was his ability to teach and make something difficult easily absorbable.He had this strange ability to make one movement solve a number of problems. You may have learned one move, but this move worked as an offensive punch, a defense against a weapon, and a soft technique with a small modification.Not only did I learn how to do one movement that did many things, I learned how to teach a movement by his instruction. Even though I had no desire to teach, he forced me to do it. As I taught, I learned even more.This idea goes well beyond martial arts and business. People should search out coaches for multiple aspects of their life ‚Äî particularly writing. Just as Daniel from the Karate Kid needed Mr. Miyagi, those who believe the pen is mightier than the sword need a coach as well.The good thing about a writing coach is that they don‚Äôt have to actively coach you. You can learn passively by reading other‚Äôs work. I‚Äôve found Ryan Holiday and Malcolm Gladwell to be excellent teachers. Even though they‚Äôve never said a word to me, they‚Äôve taught me much.I‚Äôve also found more local coaches on this platform of Medium. August Birch gives excellent advice when it comes to writing. Just from randomly reading his articles, I‚Äôve picked up a lot of helpful hints that have made me a better writer.Jessica Wildfire is a 3rd degree black belt with the English language. Her sentence structure and approach to telling a story keep you completely engaged. Just by reading her work, you learn by osmosis the art of telling a story.If we all need a coach, there‚Äôs a crap load of coaching positions to be filled.In Ryan Holiday‚Äôs book Ego Is The Enemy, he describes a principle called Plus, Minus, Equal. Ryan learned of this idea from MMA legend Frank Shamrock. In this theory one searches for a plus. This plus is someone who knows more than you in your field of study and who can coach you. You would also search for an equal. An equal is someone on your level who you can compete with. This person will be a training partner and adversary who will make you better. Finally, you would also search out a minus. A minus is someone who is below your level, who you can teach and mentor.By finding a plus, you‚Äôve humbled yourself to accept that you don‚Äôt know all things. You‚Äôve also given yourself the ability to keep learning.By finding a minus, you‚Äôve agreed to help someone lesser in your particular field. Some may only see this as charity, but it‚Äôs much more than that. This ‚Äòcharity‚Äô actually helps the giver.As I learned to be a better martial artist by teaching, you‚Äôll be a better whatever you are by coaching the lesser. You truly don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of your chosen skill until you have to teach it.You may be able to do ‚ÄòX‚Äô, but why do you do this particular thing at a particular time? As you teach, you‚Äôll be peppered with questions from angles you never expected. In answering questions, you‚Äôll have to think in depth about your particular skill. You may even find yourself having to do some research on occasion. As a result, you may have to humble yourself by teaching.Even Mr. Miyagi doesn‚Äôt know everything and may have to do some personal reflection upon a certain question.If you don‚Äôt have the patience to deal with people, you don‚Äôt have to be an active coach. As I mentioned previously, you can teach people passively. If you‚Äôre well versed on a particular subject, write an article about it. All the writers I mentioned above have taught me without ever saying a word specifically to me.You can do the same and teach lessons with your pen or keyboard. Perhaps video could be your method of coaching? You may be thinking to yourself that you have nothing to teach the world. I know I inwardly laughed when my martial arts instructor told me I‚Äôd have to teach. However, you have experience in something that others can benefit from, no matter how obscure the knowledge.Thank you for reading my ramblings. If you‚Äôve enjoyed what you‚Äôve read, please share. Hopefully this article has opened some closed eyes to the idea of having and being a coach. Even the best in the world need a coach and everyone themselves can be a coach too. It‚Äôs wonderful circle where one can teach and be taught endlessly.",31/05/2019,2,0,2,9,910,602,3,0,0,17,186

Your Goals Depend on How You Set Your Intentions,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/your-goals-depend-on-how-you-set-your-intentions-1c774f60382b,Zach Arend,1100,5,874,"Whoever said the road to hell is paved in good intentions wasn‚Äôt very effective at accomplishing goals. It‚Äôs how you set your intentions that matter most.Peter M. Gollwitzer, professor of psychology at NYU, has spent much of his life studying how goals and plans affect our behavior. His most interesting research shows us that our intentions matter.Without clear intentions, we become distracted and often miss the target.How often do you set goals and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before you lose momentum, get distracted, or choose an altogether different goal?This is where intentions come in. When all you do is set a goal‚Äìeven if it‚Äôs a SMART goal‚Äìyou‚Äôre leaving a lot to chance.Goals become reality when you set your intentions on the actions you‚Äôll take to achieve them. What will you do? How will you do it, and when?Also, what obstacles might arise and how will you respond so that you continue moving in the direction of your goals?‚ÄúStrong goal intentions produce drastic changes in behavior only when they are accompanied by implementation intentions,‚Äù says Gollwitzer.Gollwitzer did a study showing how your intentions are a catalyst for achieving your goals.During the study, he had university students identify two goals for the upcoming Christmas break. Students chose goals like writing a seminar paper, settling an ongoing family conflict, or engaging in sports activities.Half the students were asked to outline a specific implementation plan to accomplish their goal.The result? Two-thirds of those who set implementation intentions achieved their goal. Whereas most of those who never set such intentions failed.There were other studies that showed similar results. Intentions have a significant impact on the likelihood of you following thru on your goals.‚ÄúImplementation intentions create instant habits,‚Äù says Gollwitzer. Intentions can even override unwanted habits. But how?It starts with identifying the cue that triggers unwanted behavior. Then set your intention on how you desire to respond the next time it arises.Setting your intentions shifts you away from impulsive reactions and unwanted habits. Instead, you get to choose in advance the desired habits for responding in a meaningful way.Your intentions focus you on situational cues allowing your behavior to be automatic. You‚Äôre no longer having to consciously try to behave in a certain way.Choking is about thinking too much. Panic is about thinking too little.MALCOLM GLADWELL, THE ART OF FAILUREBy planning ahead for what might arise, you have the opportunity to decide how you can best respond. Doing so will prepare you for the moment.Even after 48 hours, Gollwitzer‚Äôs research showed there was a noticeable improvement in a person‚Äôs behavior.Here are some tips that you might find useful:Think about the transitions during your day.Pause after a meeting, and set your intentions before you dive into your email or pick up the phone to return a message.Before walking into the house after work, decide how you want to feel and to show up for your family. How are you going to respond if the house isn‚Äôt a peaceful utopia like you hoped it would be?For some more ideas for how you can set your intentions, download this free intentions checklist.Playing to win leads to higher performance and is much more fun compared to playing to not lose. Choose to move toward what you desire, instead of avoiding what you don‚Äôt. How often do you spend most of your time and energy moving away from something? You‚Äôre wasting precious energy that could otherwise be spent planning and creating a better outcome.Do you already know what you want and have a clear goal? Next, get clear on the specific action you‚Äôll take to achieve it. What events in your day will trigger the action? How will you respond to distraction or obstacles along the way? When will you take action? How will you manage your energy? Answer these and visualize yourself showing up as your best self.In Gollwitzer‚Äôs research, he finds that intentions are most likely to stick when the goal is important to you. This is why clarity of what matters to you is more important than knowing your destination.If the goal is easy, implementation intentions aren‚Äôt as helpful. But they become important the more you choose to pursue your dream, get out of your comfort zone, and face your fears.Taking the road less traveled requires some forethought of the journey ahead.If the path is a sidewalk and someone has already done all the work to pave the way, then all you have to do is follow. But if you are creating your unique purpose in life you‚Äôll want to show up as your best self. Intentions can help.Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.HELEN KELLERWhich sounds more exciting?Your intentions will allow you to deal with competing opportunities, distractions, and challenges. The response you choose becomes automatic.Don‚Äôt leave your goals to chance. In any given moment, you might find yourself too absorbed by what you‚Äôre doing, maybe stuck ruminating, gripped by intense emotion, or just tired. In those moments you aren‚Äôt prepared to act accordingly to your goals.Prime yourself for what lies ahead. Map out your agenda and choose your course every day.

I Was Miserable as a Suburban Stay-Home Mom,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/i-was-miserable-as-a-suburban-stay-home-mom-4dc87c590292,Elle Silver,10400,4,917,"Imagine living in a large house in a ‚Äúnice‚Äù neighborhood with your husband and two children. Now imagine leaving that husband and moving with your two children into a small apartment in a gritty, urban part of town. Imagine going from being taken care of by a man to being totally on your own, the sole caretaker of two boys. Sound sad‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädepressing even? It‚Äôs not. I know. This happened to me.Today I‚Äôm a single mom living in a two-bedroom apartment in an L.A. neighborhood near the housing projects, where homeless people live on the street. That, and I‚Äôve never been happier.Marriage and a big house don‚Äôt equal happiness, folks.But you already knew that, didn‚Äôt you?When I met my now ex-husband, he already owned the big house with the half-acre backyard in a suburb of Los Angeles. He had been renting out the house to tenants, who had decided they wanted to move. We had just gotten married. It was perfect timing. This was to be the house we‚Äôd raise our kids in.I got pregnant once, and soon I was pregnant again. When our children were old enough, they played in that large backyard, scrambling over the grass, climbing the trees and wasting more water by running the hose than they should have in drought-ridden L.A. At three years old, each boy went off to private preschool. I spent my mornings gardening and buying ‚Äúbasic bitch‚Äù garb at Marshall's and sometimes Macy‚Äôs. With my boys in preschool, I no longer attended the stroller exercise class that I had been going to, trying to work off the baby weight still padding my hips and belly as I pushed along a Bugaboo.I exercised at home now, doing yoga on the floor. When I wasn‚Äôt stretching, I was cleaning. Oh, to keep a big house clean with two boys and a husband. A job in itself.Very rarely I had a coffee date with another stay-home mom. Sometimes I was successful in arranging a play date for the boys on the weekend. Once a week, my husband and I escaped the kids for a couple of hours when we dropped them at his parents‚Äô. We‚Äôd go out to dinner, then come home and have sex.I was bored as hell.I‚Äôd spent my twenties, chasing rockers, making documentaries. I spent my early thirties living in Spain where I‚Äôd worked as a dominatrix. I published a book and wrote for Spanish magazines. When my mom got sick four years later, I came home to the States. I met my husband, a nice, smart guy from a traditional family like mine. We got married.When I got pregnant, we decided I‚Äôd stay home with the baby while he continued to work. Now if I wanted to buy something that was considered ‚Äúexpensive,‚Äù I asked permission. I did this out of respect. I also did this because usually it was a question of whether we could afford the item or not. Life in Los Angeles with two kids and only one working parent is pricey.I was taken care of but I also felt like I had no control over my life. I was wholly dependent on a man for everything.I had few friends. It wasn‚Äôt for lack of trying. Oh, I tried. I made phone calls. I held parties. Other stay-home moms came over and oohed and aahed at our new appliances. Yes, our house was beautiful. Yes, these were top-of-the-line appliances. Yes, the bathrooms had been gutted and rebuilt with the latest fixtures. Yes, the yard was gorgeous, thanks to the landscaping and also to my gardening. But what use was all that beauty when I felt so alone?The other moms were different than me. I wanted to have deep conversations about art, literature, politics, and even sex. That kind of conversation made these women uncomfortable. They preferred to talk about the weather and how they only bought organic and of course about their husbands. Or they wanted to talk about the newest diet or exercise craze that would help us all lose weight. We‚Äôd drink ros√© and I‚Äôd feel miserable.I couldn‚Äôt be myself.Things changed overnight when I left my husband ten years later. It‚Äôs a long story, but I had to leave. I moved from the suburbs to an urban neighborhood. It wasn‚Äôt all that far from our old house, but the demographics were night and day.There, I rented a two-bedroom apartment. When my old acquaintances found out, they felt sorry for me.She‚Äôs divorced. She‚Äôs a single mom now. She‚Äôs living in an apartment in a ‚Äúbad‚Äù part of town.Yup, and I was also happy.I didn‚Äôt envy their marriages or their lives. I was finally living again. I was living my true life.Yes, I was struggling. I hadn‚Äôt worked in years and I now had to manage to provide for myself and my two children. My ex-husband had lost everything in the financial crisis and no longer had money to provide child support.But I was happy. I was making new friends ‚Äîpeople like me. People who had also attempted to live perfect, cookie-cutter, suburban lives in the way we thought society expected us to. We had tried to be the best parents for our children. I had tried to be the perfect mother, the perfect wife.I had failed. I failed because I wasn‚Äôt being authentic. My life only looked perfect on the outside. On the inside I was dissatisfied.I left that life. I‚Äôm a better mom for it now. And I‚Äôve never looked back.",30/05/2019,3,0,0,1,1050,1312,1,0,0,3,348
Talk to the Internet with IP addresses,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/talk-to-the-internet-with-ip-addresses-8f315ea28496,Stephanie Wong,800,7,1203,"Managing hundreds of IP addresses ‚Äî across servers, load balancers, firewalls, DNS servers, NAT gateways, and proxies ‚Äî is a headache that I‚Äôd give my left arm to avoid. Yet, one of the linchpins of on-prem systems is this aggressive use of IP addresses to balance, scatter, and manage traffic coming into your environment. This is all built into the configuration of your hardware and software, which ‚Ä¶seems to double every time you turn your head?When you‚Äôre looking to the cloud ‚Äî the shiny new horizon with promises of simplicity and ease of management ‚Äî it‚Äôs important to remember that creeping behind the shadows is a common operator challenge. The IP address logic you spent years tweaking and perfecting isn‚Äôt going to move like a sidecar alongside your VMs ‚Äî at least not in the same state. It will need to change in various ways, so it‚Äôs crucial to plan ahead for IP address changes that can affect your workloads, and how they interact with both internal and public network traffic. In other words, you can‚Äôt simply move your existing IP addresses to the cloud with your services.Why not? Cloud providers and data centers have a limited pool of IP addresses that they own, like a deluxe Bingo ping pong ball cage, exhausting and replenishing addresses as workloads request them. The sticking point is that providers often reuse previously assigned IPs in order to maximize their usage. This means that your services will receive a dynamically-assigned internal/external IP address. By default, these addresses are ephemeral, meaning if you restart your instance, you will lose those IPs and receive new ones. That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs like spending an entire Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs before realizing something is very, very off. And this is where it can become an even bigger headache than what you started out with on premise.If you find yourself in this painful situation, there are basically two solutions you can run through:Of course both will work, but they come with a big downside: As your cloud IPs change, any dependencies your services have on those IPs will break. Hardcoded IPs usually require a network admin to manually change, which means this can quickly turn into a nightmare of maintenance, like patching a leak in a pipe with new leaks constantly appearing.Let‚Äôs say you spin up your first backend machines in the cloud, and decide to tear them down for a period of time to save on costs. Suddenly when you‚Äôre ready to get them up and running again, you notice you lost those dynamically assigned IPs only to find new ones. Now, you‚Äôre left reconfiguring your on-prem app and any firewall rules to point to the new public IP of your cloud backend. This can grow tiresome and unwieldy over large environments.Google Cloud gives you a reliable solution with reserved static IPs. If your VM is shut down, you can retain the same internal and external IPs when you restart your instance. You can feel relaxed knowing that if you point a forwarding rule, firewall rule, or application to your cloud instance IP from within or out of the VPC network, you do not need to reconfigure the IPs every time you shut down your instances. This is especially handy if you are dependent on a specific IP address for your workload, and you‚Äôre tired of fending off your teammates from using that IP address. The best part? You can even promote a previously ephemeral IP to be a static one, helping you cut corners in a few places.For Compute Engine, you can assign one internal and one external IP address for each VM. For both cases of internal and external IP addresses, you can choose ephemeral and static IPs. With internal IPs, Google assigns your VM an ephemeral IP from your subnet range, unless you specify an internal IP within your subnet range. You can, however, reserve one later on and assign it to your VM if you decide you need a static internal IP.For external IPs, the same applies. Unless you assign your VM a reserved static external IP, Google will assign an ephemeral external IP randomly from a pool. Or, you can choose not to assign a public IP whatsoever, which can help reduce security risk and keep instances from being exposed to the public Internet. Again, you can assign a static external IP later. You can also a create custom external IP if you want to keep the one you had on-premise, which can save you from remapping dependent apps. Just keep in mind that static external IPs that aren‚Äôt assigned to an instance accrue a small cost. This is to help preserve IPs for instances that need them.Let‚Äôs walk through internal/public IP set up:One thing I mention in the video above is the considerable advantage of using internal IPs for network performance:Internal VMs talking to other internal VMs have the best network performance when using internal IPs. Otherwise, your internal VM‚Äôs traffic have to travel back to the public Internet through public IPs, which can slow it down. For example, maintain internal traffic between a database server and a web server on the same VPC network, or use Private Google Access with Google APIs and services.On the other hand, if you need the VM to communicate with the public Internet or a VM in a different VPC network, your VM must have a public IP address, unless you‚Äôve set up a proxy or VPN to the other network. I did a test to see the variation of performance when using internal versus external IPs within the same VPC.I found that you have less variable TCP throughput performance and much higher Mbps throughput when you use internal IPs among a variety of machine types.Once you understand how IP addresses are affected and the cascading effects your actions can have on your overall architecture, you see how useful it is to have remappable IP addresses. If you plan on deploying front end servers in the cloud, this can save you from huge headaches down the road. GCP gives you flexible options like promoting ephemeral IPs to static, the ability to reserve specific IPs, and the ability to protect your VMs by removing external IPs. It‚Äôs a lot to think about!There are some caveats when it comes to IP address range overlaps when doing things like VPC peering and on-prem Interconnect, but I‚Äôll leave you with this: Planning out IP ranges and usage is one of the first things you should clearly map out, and it‚Äôs about finding a balance. Creating a more restrictive and secure IP address topology usually means less flexibility and more friction. Think about how you can create a VPC topology with IP ranges that give you the freedom to scale and are as open as possible, while still secure. Consideration points include: production vs. test environments, peered and on-prem IP range reservations, and conservation of your IP space by using non-routable IPs. It‚Äôs a challenge that leaders in SDN like Google are redefining and making easier to approach so you can get started as quickly as possible.Stay tuned for more on this series and thanks for joining me on this wild ride to demystify cloud networking.",30/05/2019,0,0,3,6,999,527,7,3,0,9,81
Objectivity is the Most Important Design Skill,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/objectivity-is-the-most-important-design-skill-863aa6de5c78,Joshua Dillon,9,22,4872,"In nearly every conceptual, practical, or philosophical view of Everyday Empathy, popular culture is correct. Empathy is pretty great.Down the rabbit hole of popular Design theory, Empathy becomes considerably more nuanced.tl;dr version can be found in the article summary.Who is the Human benefiting from the Design solution?Because ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of the Human Centered Design process is most effectively measured by the degree of a Design solution‚Äôs benefit to its human actor, Human Centered Design practitioners must understand the stated human need, as well as the motivating nature of the need, to effectively respond with Design solutions that create meaningfully impactful products, services, and experiences on the actor‚Äôs behalf.What is the human feeling? What is the human thinking? What does the human need? What does the human want? What is the human‚Äôs ideal outcome? What are the human‚Äôs motivations and expectations? What are the human‚Äôs measures of success? How can we create systems that directly benefit the human? How can we create meaningful benefits for all of the humans acting within a system?How can we better understand the motivating nature, circumstance, and context, of the human‚Äôs need, ideal outcome, or measure of success?By being Empathetic.Assuming the perspective of the human benefiting from the Design solution gives Human Centered Design practitioners a method to understand the context and meaning of collected Design Research, Human Centered system observations, and qualitative human feedback.Within Human Centered Design processes, Empathy is the attitude, method, and practice of assuming the point of view of an identified human actor to better understand their needs, outcomes, and metrics for success, when designing meaningfully impactful services, products, or experiences.According to Design Culture, Empathy is Everything.As the conceptual usage, and industry attitude of the word ‚ÄúEmpathy‚Äù continues to evolve within the intersection of Design philosophy and practice, it has become increasingly difficult to find a crisp, meaningful definition on which to base team expectations.Empathy Everyday. Empathy is Compassion. Empathy Works. Empathy is a Stage. Empathy is a Foundation. Empathy is a Powerful Sales Technique. Empathy is a Lifestyle. Empathy is a Key. Empathy is a Framework.With each new philosophical perspective highlighting the conceptual value of Empathy, its practical purpose within Human Centered Design can often become misunderstood. This misunderstanding leads to emotionally subjective interpretations of the human actor, resulting in Design solutions that do not meet objectively identified needs, goals and ideal outcomes.Because each Collaborative Design contributor brings with them a different perspective (or article) on how valuable Empathy is as a worldview, business practice, or technological philosophy, there can be numerous disagreements about its interpretation and use when participating in the Design of practical, real-world solutions.Empathy has such a wide range of interpretations and emotional considerations outside of the Design space, that it becomes a difficult subject to tackle when setting expectations for the attitude of Collaborative Design teams.How Empathizing with the Human Actor Drives Design Processes.As Design practitioners highlight the perspective of the human actor across collaborative teams and functions, participating contributors align around a common Human Centered objective.Human Centered Design places an identified human actor at the center of a series of contextual problem statements, around which Design practitioners frame discovery research, testing hypothesis, and Collaborative Design exercises to determine ‚ÄúHuman-Driven‚Äù Design solutions.The goal of the Human Centered Design team is to create meaningful benefit for the ‚Äúhuman actor‚Äù by viewing Design challenges from their perspective when making decisions that will impact the actor‚Äôs experiences.With empathy serving as an effective way to understand the ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù part of the Design team‚Äôs problem statement, practitioners are able to more effectively gauge the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of the solution throughout the Design planning, creation, and implementation phases. This attitude of ‚ÄúPerspective-Based Decision Making‚Äù guides Design practitioners throughout the iterative creation of any process, function, or service, providing a touch point for the human actor within a system.Articulating the human actor‚Äôs perspective gives the Design team a frame of reference for the context of the actor‚Äôs needs, bringing together otherwise disparate facts and feedback to create a clear view of the Design problem, as well as the solution.Establishing empathy as a team philosophy drives Design attitudes and discussions when creating a wide variety of Design or Research artifacts, deliverables, or solutions.Designing with Empathy means that team observations, hypothesis, discussions, and solutions focus on creating benefit, or improving the condition, relationship, or experience, of the human actor.Responding directly to human needs, making choices with the human‚Äôs benefit in mind, and incorporating meaningful human feedback, all represent practical applications of Empathy within Human Centered Design philosophies.Empathy is meaningless without a meaningfully defined purpose.As varying popular usages of the word ‚ÄúEmpathy‚Äù continue to shift its tactical, professional use, it becomes increasingly important for Collaborative Design practitioners to re-center Empathy as an objective attitude when participating in the Human Centered Design process.When Design practitioners objectively assume the point of view of a human actor, Empathy has a practical, beneficial purpose within the Human Centered Design framework.The goal of Empathy within the Human Centered Design process is to create a perspective-based understanding of human needs, ideal outcomes, and measures of success. By understanding the actor‚Äôs perspective, Design practitioners frame objective assumptions and observations to create a solution for further feedback and testing.The Human Centered Design toolkit includes a wide variety of collectively established exercises, attitudes, and techniques, to objectively establish a deep understanding of the needs of the human actor, and then meaningfully respond by testing and assessing different human-facing hypothesis to identify and deploy the most beneficial Human Centered solution.Applying Empathy within Human Centered Design practice gives Design practitioners a method to better understand and contextualize the motivations of the human actor by objectively viewing the conditions or benefits of the Design solution from the human‚Äôs perspective.Types of Empathy as Framed by Human Centered Design Practice.Within Human Centered Design exercises, Empathy is the ability to take the perspective of the human actor who will directly benefit from the Design solution.Because many Design contributors consider ‚ÄúEmpathy‚Äù to be a universally understood word, with applications and meanings outside of the Human Centered Design process, setting expectations for how best to practically apply Empathy during Collaborative Design phases becomes a critical factor in focusing team discussions and exercises productively.Affective Empathy establishes an emotional perspective, while Cognitive Empathy establishes a psychological perspective.Affective Empathy is the act of understanding the perspective of a human actor by emotionally identifying with their feelings or emotional condition. Affective Empathy identifies with the emotion of the human actor, and as a result, exhibits an emotionally-driven response.Taking on the emotional perspective of the human benefiting from the solution is intended to minimize the inherent emotional biases of the Design practitioner, and provide a holistic understanding of emotionally complex problem statements. When applied to Human Centered Design methods, Affective Empathy runs the risk of encouraging an ‚ÄúEmotion By Proxy‚Äù mindset within the practitioner.Cognitive Empathy is the act of understanding the perspective of a human actor by psychologically identifying with their mental model, point of view, or state of being. Cognitive Empathy provides Design practitioners with an analytical model to identify with the psychology, thought process, and methods of human actors to better understand their world view and associated perspectives.Adopting the psychological perspective of the human actor gives Design practitioners a way to represent and respond to the human attitudes, expected systems, and underlying mental models that most resonate with the actor inside the space of the Design solution. Human Centered Design exercises also commonly focus on using Tactical Cognitive Empathy to identify possible Design solutions that resonate with the perceptions, functions, or mental models of the human actor.{A Brief Word of Caution: In Human Centered Design conversations involving the philosophical meaning, or practical application of the word ‚ÄúEmpathy,‚Äù voices have become raised.In a twist of ‚ÄúDesign-rony,‚Äù it is extremely difficult to change a Design contributor‚Äôs interpretation of the word ‚ÄúEmpathy,‚Äù even when trained in objective Design methods.}Common issues of Affective Empathy within Human Centered Design practices.Design choices driven by Affective Empathy create several detrimental types of fallacies. When left unchecked, these fallacies undermine the success of the Human Centered Design solution, as measured by the degree of benefit to the human actor.‚ÄúI have facilitated quantitative and qualitative research including the human. I have spoken directly with the human. I know intimate details about the human. I feel emotions on behalf of the human. I sympathize with the human. I have taken on the emotional role of the human. I am connected with the emotional perspective of the human. I know the human. I understand the human. I share the point of view of the human.‚Äù‚ÄúI am the human.‚ÄùThe primary philosophy behind the use of Empathy within the Human Centered Design process is the clear acknowledgement that Design practitioners are creating solutions on behalf of other humans. Taking on the emotional perspective of the other human does not make you that human.No matter how closely you identify with the feelings of the human, or how strongly you identify with the human‚Äôs emotional world view, or how often you have the same emotional response when using the same Design solution, you will never be the human.Design practitioners who view themselves as the human, instead of an objective advocate of our humans, do so as a representation of their own subjective world view, not out of objective consideration for the human benefiting from the solution.When taking on the emotional perspective of a human actor, Affective Empathy quickly becomes ‚ÄúInherited Emotion.‚Äù By inheriting emotions, the Design practitioner assumes their own subjective interpretation of the human‚Äôs emotion, rather than objectively determining an interpretation based on known perspectives, or new observations of the human actor.Inherited Emotion facilitates Emotional Confirmation Bias when the emotional disposition of the contributor inherits only those emotions with which the practitioner resonates. While not explicit, these intrinsic emotional value judgements wildly skew interpretations of Qualitative Research, resulting in Designs that do not address the human actor‚Äôs need.When prioritizing only the emotions of the human actor which create resonance within the Design practitioner, many other causal factors, alternate interpretations, and resulting solutions, are often de-prioritized, or ignored.Affective Empathy creates a sense of emotional justification, whereby the practitioner operationally prioritizes the emotional representation of the human over the direct feedback of the humans themselves.When taking an ‚ÄúEmotion by Proxy‚Äù approach, the practitioner feels empowered to take emotional leaps in logic to justify Design decisions, rather than objectively qualifying the value of the decision as measured against the degree of benefit to the human actor.Because the practitioner now emotionally represents the human, they feel empowered to make choices as framed by their own emotional lens, as they have now qualified themselves as the true ‚ÄúEmotional Voice of the User.‚ÄùWhen acting within Human Centered Design processes, Appealing to Affective Empathy is commonly used as a justification for a choice which may not have clearly defined logic, reason, or purpose, other than to address the emotional priority as conveyed by the Design practitioner.Emotionally justified actions on the part of the Design practitioner ultimately undermine the core principles of Human Centered Design as an objective system of representation for the human benefiting from the solution.When the feelings of the human are represented emotionally by the practitioner to a stakeholder in an effort to elicit an emotional response on which to base a decision of approval, Affective Empathy becomes a sales position.At this point, the Design practitioner is no longer advocating for the human, they are advocating for the solution by associating it with the human‚Äôs emotional story in the hopes of ‚Äúselling‚Äù the solution to a collaborator, or stakeholder.When used in ways that are subjectively (or politically) motivated, the technique of ‚ÄúThe Empathetic Sell‚Äù often misrepresents the emotional need of the human, without creating a solution that has the same level of commensurate benefit.The ‚ÄúSales‚Äù fallacy occurs when Affective Empathy is not used on behalf of the human benefiting from the solution, but is instead used to illicit an emotional response within the stakeholders, or points of review, by which projects are approved.Although beneficial to establish the emotional needs of the human within the minds of the Design team or business stakeholders, the solution itself should not need to evoke an emotional response in the stakeholder to have proven its objective benefit to the human actor.Design practitioners who incorporate Affective Empathy into the Design process can often prioritize solutions incorrectly, as a response to the emotion, rather than the cause of the emotion.Because the use of Affective Empathy is such a successful sales technique, it‚Äôs possible that no stakeholder noticed the fact that the solution does not address the causal need of the human actor, but only addresses the emotion itself.When the solution does not meet the needs of the human actor, the value of the tangible business metrics suffer as a result.If the human for which the solution is being designed does not directly benefit from the practitioner‚Äôs emotional representation of their need, the solution will be unsuccessful when judged by the metric of that human‚Äôs benefit.‚ÄúI understand the human‚Äôs emotions. I know what will make the human happy. I know what the human wants. I find this solution emotionally compelling. I like it. I believe this solution will address my emotional need. I feel like this is the right decision. This is the decision that means the most to me, the arbiter of the human‚Äôs emotions.‚Äù‚ÄúI like this one better.‚ÄùDesign practitioners who take on the emotional burden of the human actor are also clearly defining the measure of their own success. When Design practitioners act emotionally, even on behalf of the human actor, they have now shifted the stated measure of Human Centered Design ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù to reflect their own emotional qualification. This attitudinal shift minimizes the practical needs of the human actor and establishes the metric for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù with the practitioner themselves.By gauging their own emotional reaction as a litmus for solution success, Design practitioners operating with Affective Empathy are qualifying their own subjective emotional reaction above the needs of the human actor.Self-congratulatory emotional qualifications undermine the value of Human Centered Design methods. Design practitioners must objectively understand the nature of the human need, while also facilitating human-driven evaluations of the proposed solution.When Design practitioners come to an understanding of the emotional point of view of the human, they must not take on the emotional burden of that understanding, as it will shift ‚Äúpractitioner bias‚Äù into ‚Äúemotion by proxy.‚ÄùIntroducing one more layer of emotional complexity by asking the Design practitioners to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù on behalf of the human actor creates confusion, opinion, and frustration, on teams specifically assembled to objectively create meaningfully impactful solutions on behalf of a human actor.When Design practitioners express points of view based on a feeling, rather than a thought, they have either unknowingly adopted the Human‚Äôs bias as their own, or are presenting their own emotional biases under the guise of ‚Äúrepresenting the human.‚ÄùInherited emotional bias is what designers, researchers and product leaders must maintain objectivity to resolve, especially within teams focused on the Design ‚ÄúSolutioning‚Äù phases of Human Centered Design processes.Affective Empathy erodes the value of objective reasoning by unnecessarily introducing an emotional component into an otherwise objectively driven framework. Because the objective representation of the human actor is the critical cornerstone of Human Centered Design methods, objectively responding with meaningful Design solutions should be the Collaborative Design team‚Äôs highest priority.Conversations that incorporate the use of Affective Empathy, or other subjective representations of the human, should be re-framed to identify objective methods to verify team assumptions. If Affective Empathy becomes an issue, re-center the collaborative conversation on the objectively identified perspective of the human actor, rather than the emotionally interpreted perspective of the Design practitioner.In the ideal Human Centered Design model, the human benefiting from the solution is always the point of approval, and ultimately, the final word on the metric of the solution‚Äôs success.The benefits of objectively understanding the perspective of the human actor.While Affective Empathy takes on the emotional perspective of the human actor, Cognitive Empathy focuses instead on the human actor‚Äôs psychological point of view, existing mental model, or established analytical mindset.The use of Cognitive Empathy is an extremely effective method for Design practitioners to consider a series of possible Design solutions, while also systemically gauging likely human responses, based on the understood motivating perspective of the human actor.Design practitioners who understand the psychological perspective, or the way the human thinks, are better equipped to troubleshoot points of Design friction as solutions are actively being created.Solutions based on Cognitive Empathy are grounded in the practitioner‚Äôs objective understanding of the human‚Äôs mental model, psychological perspective, or expected metrics for solution success.Applying Cognitive Empathy objectively means observing, measuring, and assessing Design decisions from the perspective of the human actor in an effort to better understand the context, condition, and circumstances of their needs, goals, and outcomes.Design practitioners often use Tactical Cognitive Empathy when exploring Design options to meet specific functional needs. Assuming the perspective of the human interacting with the functional solution drives interaction models, data architecture, and platform strategy across a wide variety of system touch points.After objectively identifying known human functional needs, goals, and metrics for success, it becomes much easier for Design practitioners to generate directly beneficial solutions as a response.Cognitive Empathy serves as a method to approximate the human‚Äôs reaction to the tasks, steps, and processes necessary to achieve the desired functional outcomes.Incorporating Empathy objectively into Human Centered Design solutions enables Design practitioners to Design systems of interaction which mirror a human actor‚Äôs intent, expectation, and progressive need.Cognitive Empathy is especially beneficial when Designing solutions including highly specialized, or enterprise-level digital applications. Because the mental models of human actors performing functional tasks at the enterprise level so closely align to the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere‚Äù of the human need, Design practitioners are able to add significant benefit by considering the psychological and functional perspective of the human actor.When Design practitioners focus on understanding the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù of functional needs, they are able to more effectively determine the ‚ÄúHow‚Äù of the Human Centered Design solution.Design practitioners are often challenged with balancing practical system variables against the needs of the human actor.In some environments, these challenges are based on limited budget, resources, or technology. In other environments, they are based on requirements, delivery timelines, or market spend. In all cases of Human Centered Design, the limitations of the system, the team, or the company, also directly shapes the solution.Cognitive Empathy gives Design practitioners a method of mentally gauging the human‚Äôs reaction to ‚ÄúTechnically Feasible‚Äù solutions in order to establish a balance between the needs of the human actor, and the practical solution limitations.When facing a technical challenge, Cognitive Empathy gives the Design practitioner a frame of reference to create assumptions, or hypothesis, on how the human might react to feasibility limitations.Once a hypothesis has been created, practitioners can then approximate the response of the human actor for further Design iteration and testing. Considering the human perspective when faced with technology or system challenges is one of the many ways that Cognitive Empathy can be objectively applied to practical, real-world Design solutions.The Design practitioner‚Äôs view into both the human need, as well as the business goals, provides the necessary visibility to practically ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù Design solutions between business metrics, technical feasibility, and meaningful human outcomes.Objectively determining ideal needs, goals, and outcomes of the human actor serves the function of Human Centered Design by clearly identifying, and continually prioritizing, the human measures of success for the solution.It is much easier to determine what benefit the human actor hopes to achieve when viewing the problem statements from the actor‚Äôs psychological perspective.As the Human Centered Design process shapes Design solutions to meet objectively identified human needs, the role of Cognitive Empathy shifts to become a practical mental checkpoint throughout Design delivery and implementation.Design practitioners acting with Cognitive Empathy are able to incorporate the human actor‚Äôs perspective when troubleshooting business, technology, or system limitations throughout the end-to-end Design and Delivery process. This continued focus on the perspective of the human actor throughout the Delivery process maintains a meaningful connection between the solution and the human actor, even as code rolls off the digital presses.Cognitive Empathy gives Design practitioners a method to objectively apply team understandings of the human perspective, mental model, and referable research observations, to technical challenges with the intent of balancing delivery feasibility against the needs of the human actor.During different phases of the Human Centered Design process, the benefits of Cognitive Empathy shift to continue to meet the needs of the human actor.The application and value of Cognitive Empathy within Human Centered Design evolves throughout the Design and Delivery process, based on the corresponding uses and goals of each Design process phase.When included during problem framing exercises, Cognitive Empathy serves as a way to better understand the needs of human actor. During ideation phases, Cognitive Empathy plays the role of motivation, prioritization, and goal identification for team brainstorming. During iteration stages, Cognitive Empathy provides a functional perspective, driving tactical Design solutions. During research and assessment, Cognitive Empathy gives the Design team a way to contextualize feedback and actor responses.Although a demonstrated method for determining a human actor‚Äôs perspective need, identified priority, or expected outcome, Cognitive Empathy must still be objectively rendered into a Design solution that creates an associated level of meaningful benefit as a reflection of the perspective human need.The Fine Balance of Detached Attachment.Objective Empathy is purposeful. Objective Empathy is strategic, tactical, and meaningful. Objective Empathy understands human needs, while also balancing an inherent knowledge of ‚Äúthe system,‚Äù to deliver the highest possible benefit to the human actor, within the circumstances of real world constraints.The success of Empathy‚Äôs contribution to the Design process is determined by the effectiveness of the Design practitioner to objectively understand, represent, and respond to, the perspective of the human actor within the context of the Design solution.In either functional model of Empathy, objectively representing the human actor‚Äôs perspective is the core consideration of its application and functional use within Human Centered Design frameworks.Design practitioners must learn to objectively administer the application of Empathy as both a step, and a team attitude, when formulating solutions based on Human Centered Design practices.Human Centered Design practices place a high degree of emphasis on Empathy as a way of understanding a human actor‚Äôs needs, goals, and outcomes because the determination of Design solution ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is measured by its degree of direct benefit to the human actor.Establishing Objective Empathy as a driving team attitude should be clearly articulated when assembling Collaborative Human Centered Design teams. Designers create the most beneficial solutions by understanding all of the variables of the system, including variables which may not be directly driven by the human themselves.Many of the decision points that create successful design solutions are not known to the human actor. The value of ‚ÄúEmpathetic Understanding‚Äù is the Design practitioner‚Äôs ability to view the problem from the perspective of the user, while also responding from the standpoint of a professional Design practitioner. This dual purpose must be objectively applied to find balance between the needs of the human, and the service, product, or technology.It is the Design practitioner‚Äôs responsibility to Empathetically understand the human need, and respond with meaningful Design solutions, while also objectively balancing the human benefit against the functional needs and limitations of the ‚Äúsystem.‚ÄùObjectively balancing the human perspective against the functional considerations of the solution is one of many benefits Objective Empathy provides within the Human Centered Design process.As Design practitioners approximate and evaluate possible perspectives of the human actor, they must practice objectivity to effectively minimize their own relative preferences, biases, and world views.Maintaining objectivity can be especially difficult when Collaborative Design participants are contributing a highly specialized skill or business function.While the entire Design team shares the same inherent challenge of objectivity, those with specialized skill sets are often motivated by different systemic considerations than the Human Centered problem statement. Specialized team considerations run a higher risk of driving decision making as a reflection of a ‚Äúdepartmental‚Äù need, rather than an associated Human Centered benefit.Objectively discussing the impact of specialized team roles or functions on the experience of the human actor facilitates increasingly successful Human Centered Design solutions by focusing team conversations around the human actor‚Äôs response to system limitations.Considering the human actor‚Äôs perspective when reviewing specialized limitations or opportunities gives the Collaborative Design team a forum to troubleshoot alternative solutions which meet the needs of the human actor, as well as the needs of specialized team functional contributions.The role of Objectively in the Design Research process.The functional contribution of Human Centered Design Research is to objectively observe, test, measure, or evaluate the motivations, needs, outcomes, attitudes, or responses, of the human actor.Design Researchers act as facilitators for Human facing conversations with the intent of observing, measuring, or quantifying various determining factors of benefit, while also assessing or qualifying the human‚Äôs response to a variety of Design solutions. Design Researchers facilitate the conversation, feedback, observation, qualification, and quantification of the human actor through a wide variety of methods, techniques, and exercises. Design Research tests are often targeted to illicit specific types of feedback, or indicators of success, from a human actor as a reflection of Design ‚Äúsuccess.‚ÄùBecause many of the Human Centered Design team‚Äôs decisions will be based on incorporating the direct feedback of the human benefiting from the solution, it becomes increasingly important to establish objectivity, trust, and transparency as a central characteristic of Design Research contributors.Objectivity minimizes subjective Research variables across different Design Researchers, effectively establishing a comparative baseline, from which to draw meaningful Design conclusions.Objective Design Research gives Design practitioners a central team knowledge base, compiled from both Qualitative and Quantitative Research results. When compiled and reviewed, objective research findings can be meaningfully compared, referenced, and analyzed by cross-functional teams when evaluating Design solutions for testing and evaluation.When Design Researchers become influenced by Affective Empathy, subsequent results, observations, readouts, and findings become an interpretation, rather than an objective representation, of the human actor. This bias ultimately leads to a Design solution that addresses the subjective views or interpretations of the Design Researcher, rather than the actual needs of the human actor.Inaccurate, biased, or ‚Äúinterpreted‚Äù Design Research creates a false metric for success, significantly impacting the ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù of the Design solution‚Äôs response when measured against the actual needs, goals, and outcomes of the human actor.Effectively communicating Qualitative and Quantitative results is a key responsibility of Design Research practitioners.Communicating Human Centered Design Research results across departments, roles, and collaborators provides a central ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù reference point, which helps facilitate Empathy for the human actor within larger organizations and team functions.As practitioners gain visibility into objective Design Research, it becomes easier for cross-functional teams to understand their impact on the human‚Äôs experience. When Human Centered Design Research become ‚Äúfiltered,‚Äù contextual details which may have meaning to certain specialized team contributors may be minimized, or lost, when only limited Research results are presented.As the functional specialties of different Design contributors may be interested in different solution-impacting aspects of the human actor‚Äôs perspective, limiting or distilling Design Research based on the interpretation of the Researcher ultimately ignores, or minimizes, different functionally specialized opportunities that can be found in Research results.Qualitative and Quantitative Research results benefit the entire cross-collaborative Design team by establishing a common frame of reference for solution success across departments, and contributing team functions.When balancing Empathy objectively, Human Centered Design practitioners are able to effectively identify causal needs, craft and evaluate ideal human outcomes, and Deliver meaningful benefit to the human actor more effectively than traditional requirements-led Design processes.Empathy is more than just an attitude, tool, or Design-sales jargon.In the world outside of Design frameworks, Empathy, Sympathy, and Compassion make up a trifecta of traits that indicate an emotionally balanced worldview within human actors. Empathy is highly encouraged in nearly any social context, and most articles conceptually highlighting the value of Empathy (especially in the workplace) are in support of the larger socio-cultural ‚Äúgood,‚Äù which is something that even the saltiest Design practitioners can easily support.Empathy is an act of respect and acknowledgement. Empathy is caring enough to take the time to understand the perspective of another person. Empathy is an act of listening, sensing, and observing, to better understanding another human‚Äôs perspective. Empathy is acting with consideration. Empathy is that tingly feeling you get when you emotionally resonate with another human. Empathy is a lot of the things.Empathy forms the basis for any mutually beneficial relationship between everyday human actors.Design practitioners who adopt Objectivity as their foundational guiding Design principle employ many different types of techniques, exercises, and methods, to respond to the needs of the human actor. As a universally applicable attitude, Empathy must purposefully lead to Objective evaluation, conclusion, and action on the part of the Design practitioner, to truly benefit the human actor.While Empathy does serve the Design team as attitude, method, and philosophy, the objective balance of anticipated human benefit must be weighted against the real world circumstances and limitations of the practical, usable, and functional Design solution.Designers who take on the emotional burden of the human actor undermine the Objective nature of the Human Centered Design process, delivering Design solutions that do not meet the human actor‚Äôs need.Empathy is one of many exercises, methods, and attitudes, but Objectivity remains as the most universally important Design skill.",31/05/2019,1,0,15,53,706,506,8,2,0,9,93
Curves & how they‚Äôre stored in computers,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/curves-how-theyre-stored-in-computers-6211e2b0ed59,Shukant Pal,252,4,608,"Have you ever thought out how Google Maps stores those chaotic paths across Earth‚Äôs spherical curvature? Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs not so complicated.Let‚Äôs say you were given an interesting function f(x) that describes an arbitrary curve, for 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1. You can only solve for f(x) through an API, but cannot represent it any other how. How you will you send this curve over a network?A simple method would be to sample (solve f(x)) at many points and then send those coordinates over the network. The receiving client can then connect the dots and form an (almost) smooth curve, without actually solving for f(x). This solution works for small sets of data; however, we want to have a more concise and human-friendly way of storing those curves. In this article, I‚Äôll talk about the bezier curve.Bezier curves are described by a set of control points, which are repeatedly linearly interpolated. The resulting curve passes through the initial and final control points, but is only attracted to the other points.This curve‚Äôs degree is directly related to the number of control points. This bezier curve has four control points; hence, it is a cubic polynomial.I like to think bezier curves as recursive, weighted averaging of points. Take two points A(x,y) and B(x‚Äô,y‚Äô): how do we connect these two points?Let‚Äôs say a variable point C cuts AB at a ratio t:(1 - t), then C is the average of A and B, where A is given weight t and B is given weight (1-t). Essentially,C = t*A + (1 - t)*BNow, the mid-point is when t=1/2, where C = A/2 + B/2. If you sample this equation from 0 to 1, then you will connect A and B. Congrats, you‚Äôve already learnt the linear Bezier curve.Extending the linear Bezier curve to higher degreesLet‚Äôs first make a notation for a point between A and B, that is calculated by parameter t in the equation we formed. That point can be P(A, B, t). That means P(A, B, 1/2) is the mid-point of AB and P(A, B, 1/3) and P(A, B, 2/3) divide AB into three parts.Now, we want to form a quadratic curve that goes from A to C, and is attracted towards point B. Just like we took the weighted average of A and B in the linear bezier curve, we will take the weighted average of corresponding points on AB and BC.P(A, B, C, t) = t * P(A, B, t) + (1 - t) * P(B, C, t)Similarly, you can this to the next level and take the weighted average of two points on two quadratic bezier curves (P‚Å∞P¬πP¬≤ and P¬πP¬≤P¬≥), which are indicated by the blue dots. and form a cubic curve.You can generalize an algorithm from these animations:De Castelijau‚Äôs algorithm is another way to draw a bezier curve. If you take a point evaluated at parameter t, then the curve can be split into left and right curves at that point. Hence, you repeatedly split curves until a certain depth, and store the splitting points in an array.Bezier curves are good for a few points. However, several points cannot be connected using one bezier curve. This is because the degree of the resulting curve will be very, very high. A higher degree means more computation power is used and the curve will be excessively ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù and will be barely ‚Äúattracted‚Äù to any one point. In practice, bezier curves are knitted together piecewise for many points.Final notes: Bezier curves are just interpolation of control points. They are the basis for B-Splines, which can be thought of knitting together lower degree bezier curves for more than n+1 points.",30/05/2019,0,0,5,28,470,237,4,1,0,1,137

Working With The Voices In My Head,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/working-with-the-voices-in-my-head-2e0684db81d3,Micah Baldwin,15400,5,1051,"For most of my life, I would sit down in front of a white screen with a blinking cursor and just start writing. The words would flow and in the back of my brain, a small, but persistent, voice would cheer me on.A year ago or so, that voice was replaced with a louder voice reminding me of how little anyone wanted to read what I wrote. That my skills as a writer were lost, and the best I could ever hope for was a few likes on 280 characters.So I stopped writing.For most of my life, I have wanted to be a writer. Not just a writer, but an author. More than once, people have asked me if I would ever write a book, to which my reply was always the same, ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt want to write a book, honestly, there are few things I would rather do, but that voice in my head continually reminded me that my dream was too large. And I listened to those words. The voice, you see, is mine.So I stopped dreaming.A year ago or so, I committed to putting myself first. I made changes. I went to doctors. I even started therapy again. But I couldn‚Äôt write. The very thought of writing caused my heart to beat in overdrive. The voice no longer had to scream. Just a simple, ‚Äútsk,‚Äù and I turned on the tv instead.So I write this with my heart beating rapidly.Over that year, I learned a lot about my health, both physical and mental. That‚Äôs not right. I didn‚Äôt learn. I unlearned and explored.When we are children, we build defense mechanisms to handle the world. Some are good (don‚Äôt cross the street without looking both ways), and some are bad (never leave your house, but only bad things happen outside your house). Those defense mechanisms, over time, define who we are as adults.The world we create as children defines the life we live as adults.For me, dealing with a mind made unstable by bipolar, bipolar depression and anxiety, the defense mechanisms I built protected me against mania, deep depression and a debilitating sense of dread and overwhelmed.I couldn‚Äôt describe how I was feeling to my parents or friends, shoot, I didn‚Äôt understand how I was feeling. While I knew something was wrong, I did get properly diagnosed until I was in my 30‚Äôs. And the anxiety and bipolar depression? Not until a year ago.How did my defense mechanisms manifest themselves? As voices in my head. Many voices in my head.At this point, if you have read this far, you are probably thinking that you don‚Äôt suffer from the same disability I do, and therefore this doesn‚Äôt apply.I bet a voice told you that.We all have voices that we use to manage our lives. For me, I have many, and I am still exploring their use and trying to eliminate the ones that I don‚Äôt need and control the ones that I do.Everyone has that voice in the back of our heads that tells us we are not good enough and that no matter how hard we try, we will fail.Everyone has that voice in the back of our heads that points out all of our mistakes and why we will never amount to anything.We believe it motivational, yet it makes us feel bad.We accept it as truth.But it‚Äôs a liar.It is impossible to suck as bad as the Critic believes we do.Have you ever stopped to think of whose voice the Critic is yelling at us with? Is it a parent? An old teacher? A coach? Our significant other?Ourselves?Mine is me. I have said many times: ‚ÄúThere is no one harder on me than me.‚ÄùAnd my Critic screams.My Cheerleader is quiet, I can barely hear her (I am pretty sure it‚Äôs my mom). I can barely hear her because I have gotten so used to listening to the Critic.After all, the Critic is always right, right?My Cheerleader is Truth. The support she provides is reminding me of what I can accomplish, what I have accomplished and what I will accomplish.She gives me the receipts. The Critic never has the evidence.I struggle to remind myself of that fact. The Cheerleader is Truth.The Cheerleader is Truth.The Cheerleader is Truth.Mostly because the Critic is such a good liar. (And he is me.)But the Cheerleader is always there for me when I need her most.I just need to remember to listen.Sometimes, I need to be reminded to give myself a break.It‚Äôs ok to miss a goal. Or to eat that cake.Sometimes, I just need to be told I can just relax and that everyone that I love loves me back.The Grandmother tells me so.Sometimes, the Grandmother tells me that I should be immediately gratified, even if it‚Äôs better for me to delay a bit. I have to trust that the Grandmother means well but is not always the best arbiter of what‚Äôs best for me.But I do love my Grandmother.We each have these three voices:The Critic ‚Äî tells us when we are doing wrong even when we are doing right.The Cheerleader ‚Äî reminds us that we are good, do good and will be good.The Grandmother ‚Äî lets us slip gently and sometimes just have the cookie.It‚Äôs important to remember that the volume of the voice is not directly connected to its value. That Critic screams. We listen to it because we believe that the best motivator is critical. That we will get better if we can only spend time on what we did wrong.The Critic is a liar. Its job is not to speak truth to power, but to make you feel bad. That‚Äôs it.The Cheerleader is not the opposite of the Critic. It is not always positive; it is always truthful. Its job is to show you reality, even when it is positive.And we all need The Grandmother but in small doses. It is easy to live in a world of immediate gratification. Success needs long-term goals. Listen to your Grandmother, don‚Äôt listen to only your Grandmother.I am exploring my voices to understand the ones that exist for my benefit and those that exist to protect me from a life I no longer lead. We all have defense mechanisms we created as children.So I started writing about mine.",30/05/2019,2,0,6,5,,,0,0,0,1,442
Features vs. Benefits vs. Outcomes ‚Äî Leverage All Three to Boost Your Sales,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/features-vs-benefits-vs-outcomes-leverage-all-three-to-boost-your-sales-aa56883580a0,Lisa Mullis,159,5,1052,"Imagine you‚Äôre looking to sign up for a new coaching service. Of the ones you‚Äôre considering, you read this program description:‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get an initial consultation, a one-hour coaching session each week for six weeks, and daily email support for the duration of the program.‚ÄùAnd a second one:‚ÄúDuring the initial consultation, we‚Äôll discuss your vision and strategize next steps so you walk away with a couple of immediate wins.Then for the next six weeks, we‚Äôll hone in on your purpose and create a doable action plan that will move you from sales stagnation into profitable momentum. You‚Äôll be thoroughly supported throughout the program with daily email and phone access whenever you need it.Imagine how your newfound clarity and confidence will transform the way you do business and in turn what your business does for you.‚ÄùWhich program sounds more exciting and promising?Which one do you feel more confident will produce results?Which one would you go for?What if I told you these descriptions are actually for the same program?The difference is the first is focused on features and the second emphasizes benefits and outcomes. Right away you can see how highlighting benefits and outcomes creates a more compelling, emotional pitch.Many people get confused about the distinctions between features, benefits, and outcomes when it comes to their own marketing messaging. If that‚Äôs you, then read on because I‚Äôm going to break down the differences between these three components and explain where they fit into your communications so you clarify your value and make stronger connections and sales.Let‚Äôs start with features because this one is easy for most people. In fact, that‚Äôs why so often product and service descriptions are long on features but short on explaining outcomes. Features are attributes like size, shape, color, function, and process. A food processor can be described by its motor‚Äôs horsepower, the types of blades and attachments, and what categories of food it can handle.For services or other intangible offerings, features are the steps in the process and how it works (i.e. the number of meetings included, follow-up support, or bonus elements).In all cases, people need to know what something looks like, literally or figuratively. Describing the features of a product or service establishes base expectations and provides context.Benefits are the short-term, future-focused advantages you gain as a result of the product‚Äôs or service‚Äôs features. What can you do or experience immediately because of how the product is designed and functions? Benefits are what comes immediately after the ‚Äòbecause.‚Äô Because of that blender‚Äôs 1200-watt motor, you can pulverize hard foods like nuts and ice in seconds flat. Because the blender‚Äôs pitcher and other plastic parts are BPA-free, you don‚Äôt have to worry about chemical contamination. Because the coach meets with you weekly, you have regular access to learning and support.Benefits offer insight into what makes the product or service unique. They build the case for why the offering would be a better buy than the competition.Here‚Äôs the Triple B mental reminder:Because = Benefits = Build the caseOutcomes describe the transformations that result from using the product or service. They bring emotion into the mix. With the blender‚Äôs power and versatility, it will be easy for you to make highly nutritious meals that support your family‚Äôs health. With the intensive one-on-one support and strategic planning you get in the coaching program, you‚Äôll learn a new way of doing and thinking that will take your business to the next level.Whereas benefits are about short-term advantages, outcomes speak to the long-term gains. They paint a vision of the future where your customers have resolved their challenges and met their aspirations. Outcomes are a result of the benefits just as benefits are a result of features.Features = Benefits = OutcomesLet‚Äôs look again at the program descriptions I shared at the beginning to see how features, benefits, and outcomes work together for a compelling pitch.Description 1:You‚Äôll get an initial consultation [FEATURE], a one-hour coaching session each week for six weeks [FEATURE], and daily email support for the duration of the program [FEATURE].Again, this first description only talks about features. Features are important because they help you know the basic nature of the program, but without sharing benefits and outcomes the program feels dry and uninspiring.Description 2:During the initial consultation [FEATURE], we‚Äôll discuss your vision [FEATURE] and strategize next steps [FEATURE] so you walk away with a couple of immediate wins [BENEFIT]. Then for the next six weeks [FEATURE], we‚Äôll hone in on your purpose [BENEFIT] and create a doable action plan [FEATURE] that will move you from sales stagnation into profitable momentum [OUTCOME]. You‚Äôll be thoroughly supported throughout the program [BENEFIT] with daily email [FEATURE] and phone access [FEATURE] whenever you need it [BENEFIT]. Imagine how your newfound clarity and confidence will transform the way you do business and in turn what your business does for you [OUTCOME].In the second description, the benefits and outcomes make up nearly half the copy. You get a much better sense of what to expect and how well this program can solve your immediate and long-term challenges.For more examples including a fun and powerful way to combine features and benefits called the Benefits Burrito technique, check this out.Product and service descriptions are one of many ways to share features, benefits, and outcomes in your communications. Presented as a bulleted list, features and benefits work great for a side-by-side comparison between your offer and the competition. Highlighting benefits is essential when promoting memberships. Donation requests centered around outcomes can significantly boost response. Outcomes are also an important component of a strong positioning statement.When your features, benefits, and outcomes clearly differentiate your products and services, you‚Äôll attract more of your ideal customers. They‚Äôll be able to connect their challenges and aspirations with the solutions you offer through your product or service. When they understand the value of what you‚Äôre offering, it will be easier for them to come to a buying decision. And for you, upselling and cross-selling will be easier, allowing you to earn more and have greater impact.If you‚Äôd like more help with communicating your unique value, check out my free plug-n-play blueprint Define Your Brand‚Äôs Star Power with writing templates for developing a strong brand positioning statement.

Goals vs. Milestones,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/goals-vs-milestones-c1dcdbb1c708,Morr Meroz,83,2,417,"There‚Äôs a lot of talk about setting goals.I‚Äôve heard people define a yearly plan for their business with certain goals such as ‚Äúreaching 5000 email subscribers before the end of the year‚Äù or ‚Äú10% increase of traffic every month‚Äù, YouTubers who want to get to 10,000 subscribers in 6 months, and other generic metrics.Setting up such goals is nice, but there‚Äôs one problem with doing so ‚Äî you can‚Äôt truly control or predict these results.In other words ‚Äî no matter how many time I write ‚Äú10% monthly growth‚Äù in a Keynote presentation, I can‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôll happen. Reaching 10,000 subscribers isn‚Äôt a goal ‚Äî it‚Äôs a milestone.The way I like to define goals is around results I can accomplish by doing something specific.For example ‚Äî if I have a goal to release 3 courses this year, or an animated short, or a new weekly YouTube show, I can control whether this goal is accomplished or not. If I do it, the goal will be accomplished. If I don‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt be.I prefer to create plans and schedules that revolve around these type of goals, because then I have no one but myself to blame if I don‚Äôt accomplish them.I enjoy a good vanity metric like everybody else.I love reaching a cool number of subscribers (like when I passed 100k subscribers on YouTube) or a nice amount of monthly website visitors, but I can‚Äôt set my goals around that. Because I can‚Äôt really control it.Reaching a 100k subscribers isn‚Äôt a goal, it‚Äôs a milestone.It‚Äôs great when it happens, but it‚Äôs not an accomplishment by itself. It‚Äôs a result of other smaller accomplishments, like consistently releasing high-quality content, or doing good marketing, or slowly building a brand over a few years.I don‚Äôt think these milestones are meaningless. They are extremely important, especially if you‚Äôre trying to get a brand to advertise on your site, or if you‚Äôre trying to sell your company. You need to have these statistics under watch and make sure they are going up rather than down or plateau.But when you get down to creating a plan for the next year (or month or quarter) maybe try to think of it as project-based rather than milestone-based, and simply make sure that the projects (AKA ‚Äî goals) are effective at increasing your general analytics (AKA ‚Äî milestones).This is not only a more effective way of running your brand, but it‚Äôs also a less frustrating and more satisfying.

How To Limit Your Exposure To The Surveillance Capitalism,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/surveillance-capitalism-9294fc3a7709,Marko Saric,2800,11,1632,"Businesses are collecting, buying and scraping any piece of our data they can get their hands on.The aim is to feed their machine learning algorithms to capture our attention, increase our engagement, distract us, influence us, change our minds and manipulate us.All this to create a better and more accurate profile of who we are in order to make the ads more attractive and targeted for us to click on.A vast majority of billions of dollars in profit that Google, Facebook and others make comes directly from this ability to make us click on the ads they serve.The financial incentives of the surveillance capitalism businesses are to get us addicted to their products, manufacture a consumerist demand and generate profit for their shareholders.‚Äú The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power ‚Äú by Shoshana Zuboff is a great introduction to this intrusive system.My trip down the rabbit hole of ethical alternatives to the surveillance capitalist tools has been inspired by reading this book.‚ÄúSurveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs how Larry Page answered the question ‚ÄúWhat is Google?‚Äù in 2001:‚ÄúIf we did have a category, it would be personal information‚Ä¶. The places you‚Äôve seen. Communications‚Ä¶. Sensors are really cheap‚Ä¶. Storage is cheap. Cameras are cheap. People will generate enormous amounts of data‚Ä¶. Everything you‚Äôve ever heard or seen or experienced will become searchable. Your whole life will be searchable.‚ÄùSo what‚Äôs so bad about using Google, its platforms and apps?The following is just a sample of some of Google‚Äôs surveillance activities. Here‚Äôs a longer overview of reasons not to use Google with all the sources you may need.Perhaps a more effective way to show you what Google collects about you is just to visit the activity overview of your Google account here and take a look at all the data.And this is only what Google knows from you directly using their services. They‚Äôre not transparent about what else they collect and what else they know about you.Google is certainly not the only one. Facebook in many cases is an even worse beast. Here are some reasons why not to use Facebook.We can all agree that some of the services from Google, Facebook and other companies part of the surveillance capitalism are very convenient, useful and practical.But their system of data collection and behavior manipulation has no transparency. Concerns about using them are of an ethical and moral nature.We are not ‚Äúas some have insisted, the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of Google‚Äôs sales. Instead, we are the objects from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated for Google‚Äôs prediction factories. Predictions about our behavior are Google‚Äôs products, and they are sold to its actual customers but not to us. We are the means to others‚Äô ends. This new form of information capitalism aims to predict and modify human behavior as a means to produce revenue and market control.‚ÄùSurveillance capitalism has become the default business model for the majority of startups and apps that we use. This whole system is ‚Äú intentionally designed to keep us ignorant‚Äù and ‚Äú our ignorance is their bliss ‚Äú.We need reforms, more regulation and better regulation to put a stop to these anti-consumer practices.Until then we should become aware of these manipulative techniques, get better educated about them and take action in our digital lives to disengage and reduce their influence.The simple reason that businesses keep doing this is that it works. So if we stop rewarding their behavior, they may reconsider their actions, evolve and find better, more sustainable and more human-centric business models.This list of recommended ethical alternatives to Google features only apps I believe are pretty much up to the standards of what you can get with surveillance capitalism products.It‚Äôs important to me to still use tools that are well designed and that are easy and convenient to use.I am trying to find a balance between dramatically reducing the amount of my data that I expose to the surveillance capitalism while still using modern and useful tools.This is the reason I‚Äôm making my move away from the surveillance capitalism one step at a time.I still keep a Google and a Facebook account among others but I am more mindful about them, aware of what the usage of them entails and more careful when and why I use them and what alternatives I have.I‚Äôve actually even read some terms of service and privacy policies as these ethical alternatives are very transparent, write their policies in plain words and make it clear what they do and why.Here are the things I have done (and things you can do) to reduce the usage of Google and similar services, and restrict the amount of personal data that you‚Äôre giving to these third-party actors.For every tool I recommend in this guide, I suggest you explore it for a bit and give it a chance before making your own opinion on its usefulness to you.This is arguably the easiest switch you can make. There are plenty of options for alternative search engines and they work well too.Switching to one of these ethical alternatives and making it the search default in your browser would dramatically decrease the amount of personal data that you expose to Google.Everything from the things you search for, the websites you choose to click on, to your location.Chrome is not the only browser that exists. There are arguably better and certainly more ethical alternatives.Most of us spend most of our internet time within a browser, so choosing a good browser is the key to restricting the data you are giving away to surveillance capitalism.These ethical browsers can block all the invisible cookies and other web trackers that follow and profile you as you browse the web.They can also block all the banner advertising and other distractions meant to influence and manipulate your actions.All this makes the web so much faster and more user-friendly experience. It saves you tons of data and boosts the performance of your device too.Moving to a new email provider after using Gmail for years can seem like a daunting task.The way I‚Äôve dealt with it is that I have kept my Gmail active but slowly started moving all the important and valuable conversations to my new ethical email provider.I take action on the new email as it arrives into my Gmail. I forward the important conversations to my new address and reply from there. I change my address in the database of companies and newsletters I want to keep hearing from.The rest I ignore or unsubscribe from. Soon my old Gmail will only receive emails that I don‚Äôt really care about anymore and I may even close it.Out of all these ethical product alternatives, I feel maps can be the biggest inconvenience for specific use cases.Address lookup, live traffic, discoverability of nearby places, public transport and the ability to read reviews of the different attractions, hotels and restaurants is currently not at the same standards as with Google Maps.For your location and directions, these alternatives work great. They are even superior to Google Maps in terms of offline usage. I hope they will soon get up to the standards on the other features too.It may seem easy to escape Facebook tracking by not having an account but it‚Äôs certainly more difficult to remove Facebook from your life than Google.Most of our families and friends use the commercial social media services and it‚Äôs difficult to find an ethical alternative that has all the people you know on them.Facebook like Google also tracks you around the web using their ‚Äúlike‚Äù button and the analytics service that businesses insert into their sites and apps.These are the noncommercial alternatives that are worth exploring and seeing if you can get people you care about to use them too:Windows, Chrome OS that powers your Chromebook and Android do a lot of tracking and profiling by default. You may reduce this by changing some of the settings or using different apps but you also have the option to switch the operating system.This is the most technically challenging step in this guide and some people won‚Äôt be too inclined to explore it but I will list some options that I have found as great alternatives:So if the majority of these ethical alternatives don‚Äôt track us, don‚Äôt profile us and don‚Äôt show us ads, how do they make money?Most of the ethical software options available are part of the free and open source software movement.‚ÄúFree software‚Äù means software that respects users‚Äô freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, ‚Äúfree software‚Äù is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of ‚Äúfree‚Äù as in ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù not as in ‚Äúfree beer‚Äù. When users don‚Äôt control the program, we call it a ‚Äúnonfree‚Äù or ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program.These are mostly developed by individuals, volunteers, smaller groups or non-profit organizations. They don‚Äôt collect your data, profile you or allow advertising. Some even go great lengths to have a more environmentally friendly product.That‚Äôs why your relationships to apps should change from expecting everything for free. The reason you have a free email address from Google is that the behavior data that you leave is valuable and worth a lot of money.These are some of the ways you can support your favorite ethical software projects or your favorite content creator:There are now so many resources available for us in this exploration of ethical and humane applications. These are the sites that helped me a lot in my search for more ethical alternatives to the surveillance capitalism tools:Originally published at https://markosaric.com on May 30, 2019.",30/05/2019,1,0,35,11,1050,306,1,9,0,34,138
OOP: how I would explain it to my grandmother,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/oop-how-i-would-explain-it-to-my-grandmother-8e549180c6d0,Mike Gazzaruso,101,6,929,"Back in the days, computers were able to run lists of operations (called ‚Äúprograms‚Äù). We had some popular programming languages like Fortran, Cobol, and Basic. The programming paradigm used was ‚ÄúProcedural programming‚Äù. This paradigm involved the following statements:A program was a bunch of functions and variables, and this led to some consequences:Due to these inconveniences, quick often the programmers tended to produce the notorious spaghetti-code.So, we felt the need to adopt a more versatile approach, and thus OOP (Object Oriented Programming) comes in help for us.OOP was introduced in 1967 by the Simula programming language, followed by other languages like Smalltalk and Lisp. By the way, the real ‚Äúgame-breaker‚Äù was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup, with his C++.Since this is a beginner lecture, we don‚Äôt want to use technical terms. Furthermore, it‚Äôs plenty of good resources on the Internet, where one can learn the principles of OOP. The scope of this lecture is to give a basic yet explanatory overall vision.Classes are another name for Abstract Objects. Let‚Äôs suppose to have a Car. A Car can accelerate, brake, and steer. Furthermore, a car has four wheels and a gear shift. Now, let‚Äôs suppose to have a Scooter. A Scooter can accelerate, brake, and steer as well. It only has two wheels but no gear shift at all. But, hey, both Car and Scooter are two Vehicles! They both share some variables (or properties), i.e.: the wheels, some functions (or methods), i.e.: accelerate, brake, steer. Also, the Car has some stuff (property: Gear Shift) that the Scooter does not own.We could think to write three Classes:We put all the common stuff in the Vehicle Class (the ability to accelerate, brake and steer, plus the fact that a Vehicle has a certain number of wheels).The Car and the Vehicle Classes inherit from the Vehicle Class. So, they inherit its methods and variables, being able to redefine (or override) some of them (i.e.: we know that a Vehicle has a certain number of wheels, for sure, but we don‚Äôt know in advance how many they are, this will be declared or, better saying: implemented in its Child Classes).To visually summarise, we could write some meta-code like this:By doing this way, we can see that we don‚Äôt need to declare anything on the Scooter Class, due to the fact it inherits all properties and functions from the Vehicle Class. While inside the Car Class, we have all the stuff from the Vehicle class, plus we have to specify the extra stuff that belongs only to the Car Class.We also initialize our Class: every Car has four wheels, every Scooter has two wheels.Later, we can access our properties and call our functions (or methods), using the so-called dot notation.Let‚Äôs suppose to zoom in our Car. If we are manufacturing a real car, we would like to insert and assemble the gears, the engine, the pistons, every single screw and so on. But, it would be dangerous and also very unuseful to give the car‚Äôs buyer access on every single piece of our Car. Rather, we‚Äôd like to prefer to give him access to the higher-level controls only! To be clearer, if a driver wants to steer, he doesn‚Äôt manually insert his hand into the car‚Äôs mechanics to move the wheels, he only needs to turn the car‚Äôs steering wheel! In other words, the steering wheel acts as an interface between the driver and the car. This mechanism is a pillar in OOP and it‚Äôs called Encapsulation. It allows developers to abstract a concept, and at the same time, it allows the end user to do a task with minimum effort and minimum risk because the developer already implemented the behavior when he developed the interface. So, when we call accelerate(), we are done! Under the hood, the developer has implemented the logic to accelerate, maybe involving a plethora of actors (gears, pistons and so on). But we only have a high-level way to accelerate: invoking accelerate(). Another example could be at the Post Office: the employee at the front office could be an interface between us and the withdrawal of some cash. We can‚Äôt manually go in the back office and withdraw money (unless we want to be arrested, obviously!), so we need an interface that does the work for us. Another way of reading: I don‚Äôt know the processes that are involved to brake, but I know that if I call the function brake(), my car will brake for sure.Let‚Äôs suppose to have a Class with a function sum(). This function accepts two integer numbers and returns the sum. Later on, we want to code another function that sums two double numbers. In procedural programming, we should create two different functions, named differently, i.e.: sumInteger() and sumDouble(). With OOP we can use Polymorphism and overload the sum function.We can see how the right sum function is chosen automatically: the compiler (or the interpreter) checks for the input type. In the first case, the signature is the one from the integer sum function. In the latter case, the double sum function is chosen, since we passed two double values to the function.This enhances flexibility when we write down our code.Well, we reached the end of our journey. The purpose of this article is to give to the reader a high-level understanding of what is OOP and what advantages it offers when compared to procedural programming. If one wants to go deeper, it‚Äôs plenty of good books on the Internet. Furthermore, here on Medium, there are really good stories about it.

Understanding Menopause: How Can Technology Help?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-menopause-how-can-technology-help-a7f5c00d3e4f,Yumi Tsoy,92,7,1450,"Last year I was given an unusual task: to find startups helping women in perimenopause. The aim was to showcase the most exciting technologies in the space. However, what started off as a simple enquiry into the market, ended up being an insight into perhaps one of the biggest gaps in the femtech industry. Further research only confirmed: there is a big opportunity to address the needs of women with menopausal symptoms that few entrepreneurs to date seem to have seriously considered. Read on to get a deeper breakdown of the problem, see how some startups have started addressing this challenge and in case you are looking, get some inspiration for your next business idea.What am I talking about and why is it important?First things first, let‚Äôs start with the fact that despite being female, I had no idea what perimenopause was. Thanks to my best friend Google, a quick search confirmed that perimenopause is:‚ÄúThe time in which a woman has irregular cycles of ovulation and menstruation leading up to menopause and continuing until 12 months after her final period. The perimenopause is also known as the menopausal transition or climacteric.‚ÄùIn more human terms, it is a transitional period when a woman can be experiencing menopausal symptoms without going into menopause. Around 8 in 10 women experience such symptoms for some time before or after their periods stop, some even up to a decade in advance.Given the scale, it seemed odd that no one was talking about this issue. Things became a bit clearer when some women who I have been speaking to kindly pointed out that even those going through it often have no clue what their symptoms mean either. Imagine you are a woman in your 40s and start experiencing associated symptoms: mood swings, difficulty sleeping, muscle pain, low libido etc. You have no idea what is happening with your body and decide to see a doctor. You list some of your symptoms and get an unexpected response back, ‚ÄòIt sounds like you are depressed.‚ÄôWithout additional tests/data on female hormones, these symptoms only show the surface image, making common perimenopause symptoms resemble those of mental health issues. A worrying amount of time, unsuspecting hospital visitors are prescribed antidepressants. For many, this could lead to years of ineffective treatment. However, when addressed correctly, the symptoms can go away entirely. There was clearly a need for tools that would equip women with the right data to take to doctors or even just an expert who could immediately recognise the symptoms for what they were.To my astonishment, despite the fact that the vast majority of the female population will experience this in one way or another, there were only a handful of startups addressing this problem directly. Furthermore, no one was even talking about it. Women and men alike seemed to have found the subject too awkward, uncomfortable or even stigmatised. I talked to several women who told me about how embarrassed they felt, asking for a day off work when they experienced hot flushes and debilitating migraines (probably most common menopause symptoms).So how can technology help?Identifying women with such symptoms and finding touch points in their daily routine is no easy feat. More often than not, it requires pre-existing intent from the user, an understanding that something might not be right and that help can be found via digital means. There is still a long way to go until people have full confidence in technology but for those interested in seeing how it could help, there are a few options available.For example, when people download B-Wom, a digital coach for women‚Äôs health and wellbeing, their main goal might just be to improve how they feel on a daily basis. However, the user journey within the app means that every woman starts her experience with a detailed questionnaire. This way, even those who are not sure about their symptoms can learn what is happening with their bodies and receive helpful guidance. B-Wom could potentially identify women in perimenopause even if they initially thought their symptoms were related to something else.Similarly, Adia Health helps women with diagnosis and ongoing treatment but in their case, by first offering women an at-home finger-prick hormone test. The results are then used to inform treatment with specialist fertility professionals through their platform. Both are great because they fit into an existing user journey, helping women who are already seeking a solution but might not be fully aware of the causes behind how they feel ‚Äî a common experience for women in perimenopause.Understanding your hormones is highly important in figuring out treatment. Blood testing is by far the most common way to do that but understandably, many are not comfortable pricking themselves on a regular basis to test oestrogen or progesterone levels. There are other options, although at this point we are starting to veer towards more indirect solutions. Yono Labs, DuoFertility and Temp Drop, for example, are all wearables that track basal body temperature (BBT) ‚Äî your lowest body temperature that can act as a proxy for the level of oestrogen in your system. The biggest use case for this is in family planning, but BBT can also be a way to track cycles and their regularity, which in turn can be an indicator of perimenopause.In fact, in my research, I have found a number of quite varied diagnostic solutions: Healthy.io for urine testing, cue.me for saliva, Kenzen for sweat analysis and many others. All in one way or another enabled people to understand their bodies. However, if BBT was starting to move away from our needed use case, these solutions were even more indirect. These companies represented some of the most complex and exciting solutions, but, unfortunately, were targeting other health issues (e.g. kidney disease, stress, general athletic performance, etc.). The technology was there but it was simply not aimed at solving women‚Äôs wellness needs.I have also encountered a multitude of period tracking apps but for the most part they occupied an undecided place in the femtech world: certainly useful but not aiming to solve any complex challenges. For this reason, I will skip over them but if you are interested, you can find some good options here.Who are the favourites?So what was left? A number of impressively researched and designed solutions but in very early days of their journey. Grace Wristband is one of them, a prototype for a bracelet designed to alleviate hot flushes by sending a localised cooling sensation around the wrist. Sensors within Grace‚Äôs bracelet will allow continuous data collection that will help to understand one of the most common perimenopause symptoms in more depth. I love how neatly Grace integrates into a woman‚Äôs life: it is discrete and users do not have to do anything to obtain value from wearing the accessory. It is also the only startup that I have seen that not only combats symptoms as they happen but can even predict and manage hot flushes before they occur.Simi is another interesting example within this early-stage startup sub-category, conceived to be an end-to-end solution containing a connected saliva-based hormone tracker, an app and an analytics tool to help women manage their health. Simi placed a big emphasis on convenience: giving women a portable hormone tracker that would give them the power to monitor their health at any time. This seems to be geared at a more demanding audience who want to stay in the know at all times and more independently, without necessarily needing to see a doctor to obtain results. Although Simi is just a concept, I like how much control it gives back to the user ‚Äî it is up to the individual to decide whether they monitor their hormones, how frequently, whether they share the results etc.It is probably no coincidence that Grace and Simi, two of the most focused solutions, came from students with design backgrounds. Changing minds is not easy but turning something that is often misunderstood into a well-crafted product that puts users‚Äô needs first is the cornerstone of good design and an important step towards encouraging the right conversations.The market for femtech solutions for women over 40 still has a long way to go. It seems backwards that anyone wanting to manage their symptoms needs to find a range of indirect paths and disjointed solutions to do so. However, it is not just about connecting fragmented parts of the user journey: we could also do more to change perceptions, helping people to foster open conversations in place where we now have awkward silences. With any luck, this will lead to greater empathy and encourage a new wave of practical, relevant and effective solutions that will give women control of their health.",31/05/2019,0,0,4,2,946,633,5,0,0,16,78
Why you need to stop obsessing about your MVP,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-need-to-stop-obsessing-about-your-mvp-555bad1ebd9f,Christopher Moisan,204,5,691,"Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was a great concept. It sheds light on our assumptions and helps us think about how best to approach our product development journey.However, its greatness is perhaps only matched by the great confusion it causes. While intuitively ‚Äògettable‚Äô, its meaning is often confused, co-opted or lost altogether. So much so, that in some circumstances it gets contorted from something designed to help us reduce uncertainty and improve our chances of success to something that is used to create a ‚Äòtheatre of certainty‚Äô and definitely won‚Äôt help our chances of success.Where does it get misunderstood? And how should we think about MVP to make the most of it? We‚Äôll get to that in a moment, but first, let‚Äôs briefly reflect on its origins.Building successful new products and services is a complex undertaking. Success will be determined by many factors and variables. Some of which will be known and ‚Äòcertain‚Äô, some of which will be unknown, while others will be educated guesses and hypotheses which may prove to be true or false. This is where MVP comes in.MVP was popularised by Steve Blank and Eric Reis (Lean Start-Up Movement). For Reis, the definition was a ‚Äòversion of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort‚Äô. While Blank and Reis get the kudos, it was actually Frank Robinson from SyncDev back in 2001 that coined the phrase (yes, almost two decades ago). For Frank Robinson, MVP was founded in the principle of ‚Äúmaximising return on risk‚Äù. The key word here is risk. There‚Äôs plenty of commentary about the nuanced definition, but for me the essence of MVP is unequivocal:By identifying and validating critical assumptions and risks, as efficiently as possible, we will improve our chances of success.Doing this alone won‚Äôt guarantee success. We still have our known-knowns to build and deliver on and there‚Äôs the unknown-unknowns ‚Äî things that crop up during our product development journey that we need to address. But MVP was a brilliant way for us to think about mitigating the risks associated with our bets on what are the critical factors for success.Here are a few common examples.MVP remains a useful concept and rightly part of our toolkit. There are a few ways you can apply it within your organisation which helps make it more valuable.Using MVP to describe ‚Äòthe thing‚Äô risks your stakeholders becoming attached to ‚Äòthe thing‚Äô. Instead focus your stakeholders on the outcomes, not the features. This allows your teams to define ‚Äòthe what‚Äô and the sequencing, and focus them on the riskiest assumptions. This approach can flow through to your product development roadmaps too. Work this way and you‚Äôll have a higher probability of success. As Steve Blank said, ‚Äòan MVP is not a cheaper product, it‚Äôs about smarter learning‚Äô.Thinking in plural helps stop the focus on a single end product. Multiple MVPs also help minimise the biases that occur when we anchor to one idea or even worse, when a single idea gets too big to kill.It‚Äôs also important to remember an MPV needn‚Äôt be a product at all ‚Äî it just needs to maximise your learning vs effort. A clickable prototype or faked landing page is a valid MVP, too.Reframing MVP as a mindset and approach helps change the conversation from ‚Äòthings and features‚Äô to the critical hypotheses and tests to help us derisk. You can also apply this to other aspects of your overall service offering. What are critical service or cost assumptions you need to prove? Can you prototype something to validate these? This is also something you don‚Äôt do at the start of your journey ‚Äî it should be a continuous activity as new assumptions/risks appear. As Tom Chi, co-founder of Google X, says: ‚ÄúMaximising the rate of learning by minimising the time to try things.‚ÄùRemember: new product success is elusive for even the smartest and most experienced teams.MVP offers a smart way to identify and mitigate risks and improve our chances of success.Used wisely, and the language carefully, It can be very effective.Thanks to Yuri Yoshimura for the illustrations.This also appeared on Idean.com",30/05/2019,1,0,5,8,1050,488,2,1,0,5,115

The Threat ‚ÄòPointless‚Äô Jobs Pose to Workers‚Äô Mental Health,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-threat-pointless-jobs-pose-to-workers-mental-health-82eb5370e7ea,Michelle,145,5,1143,"It‚Äôs 9am. I‚Äôve been at work for an hour and I‚Äôve already done all the jobs I need to do. But there‚Äôs still another seven hours to go. I groan inwardly. The thought of being pinned to this desk, with nothing to do for the rest of the day, is hard to bear.Most of my days at work are like this. I started the job just under a year ago, and I was excited to take the position. I expected it to be a step up the career ladder. The job ad promised new challenges and responsibilities, and it seemed like a logical progression from my previous role.But things haven‚Äôt worked out the way I‚Äôd hoped. I don‚Äôt have enough work to do, and the work I do have amounts to nothing more than low-level admin. I have no phone calls to make, nor hardly any emails to send. I just find myself colouring in spreadsheets, typing up minutes no one reads, and updating policy documents with the new company logo.The boring and tedious nature of the job has taken its toll on both my mental and physical health. I end up feeling sluggish most days. My body gets stiff from sitting at a desk too long. Fog descends on my brain. I leave the office feeling like a zombie; heavy with lethargy and mentally drained.Worst of all though, has been the impact on my self-esteem. Being given so little to do means I end up feeling worthless, pointless, like I might as well not be there. This has made me feel like a shadow of a person; an apparition; effaced.I leave the office feeling like a zombie; heavy with lethargy and mentally drained.These feelings have been compounded by the fact that in my previous job I was very much a central part of the team. I was often busy and had responsibility for certain areas of work. My work did have an impact; if I didn‚Äôt do certain things, things wouldn‚Äôt get done. I was somebody, dammit! But now, I‚Äôm nobody. And when I see my colleagues rushing around, sighing over the length of their to-do lists, I find myself thinking, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs how I used to be‚Äô, and the extent to which my sense of self-worth has been eroded in this job hits me.In recent years, greater attention has been paid to the impact our jobs can have on our mental health. Yet, most of this is focused on tackling the effect of long hours and heavy workloads on stress levels and overall wellbeing.But my own experience has led me to believe that working a pointless or ‚Äòbullshit‚Äô job also puts workers‚Äô mental health at risk.Feelings of ennui, boredom and worthlessness pose just as much of a risk to workers‚Äô mental wellbeing as stress caused by overwork does.According to the findings of a 2015 YouGov survey, a third of the UK workforce believe their job does not ‚Äúmake a meaningful contribution to the world‚Äù. Given that research has highlighted the importance of purposeful, meaningful work in protecting people against common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, I would argue that feelings of ennui, boredom and worthlessness pose just as much of a risk to workers‚Äô mental wellbeing as stress caused by overwork does.Indeed, you need look no further than David Graeber‚Äôs recent book, Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work and What We Can Do About It, for a collection of compelling testimonies from people which describe the profoundly negative impact working a pointless job can have on mental health, from feelings of alienation and dissociation through to anxiety and complete nervous collapse. Graeber says: ‚ÄúBullshit jobs regularly induce feelings of hopelessness, depression, and self-loathing. They are forms of spiritual violence directed at the essence of what it means to be a human being.‚ÄùI agree. So, what should we do about it?I believe that tackling the problem of pointless work and the negative impact it has on mental health will require nothing less than a radical transformation of the world of work ‚Äî and thereby society ‚Äî itself.Policies such as the four-day working week and universal basic income would help to bring about such change. Firstly, they would help to free people from having to take on pointless jobs, or at the very least, reduce the amount of time we are required to spend doing such jobs. This in turn would boost wellbeing.Pro-capitalist conservative types may argue that such policies would destroy people‚Äôs work ethic and encourage us to sit around doing nothing all day. To which I say: plenty of people already are sitting around doing nothing all day, just in ‚Äòbullshit‚Äô jobs.The reason why, to return to Graeber‚Äôs quote above, pointless work destroys the ‚Äúessence of what it means to be a human being‚Äù, is because humans want to lead meaningful and purposeful lives. We need to feel that we have an impact on the world, a contribution to make. We want to feel fulfilled, to be able to flourish. Sitting at desk all day ‚Äòworking‚Äô a pointless job thwarts these needs and desires. Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt follow that freeing people from paid work would mean we all become layabouts. On the contrary, we are far more likely to use our freedom to undertake activities that fulfil the needs we have for making a positive difference in the world and for social connection.The damage pointless jobs can cause to workers‚Äô mental health may be experienced at the individual level. However, it‚Äôs collective, structural solutions that are needed to address the problem.Most importantly though, introducing things like the four-day working week and implementing a universal basic income would allow us, as a society, to re-think the role work plays in our lives. We live in a world driven by capitalism, which means paid work comes to dominate our existence; we ‚Äòlive to work‚Äô and our jobs come to form a key part of our identities. Yet with a shorter working week and a guaranteed income for all, this could change dramatically. With less of an imperative to engage in paid work for someone else, and with more time of our own, not only would the world of work be transformed, but so too would the nature of society itself.The damage pointless jobs can cause to workers‚Äô mental health may be experienced at the individual level. However, it‚Äôs collective, structural solutions that are needed to address the problem. Right now, far too many people are sat stuck behind desks, clock-watching, their minds, talents and dignity wasting away.Pointless jobs may boost the employment figures, they may serve as a means of ‚Äòsocial control‚Äô.

Anxiety Attacks vs Panic Attacks,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/anxiety-attacks-vs-panic-attacks-c1b634d66e3f,Maddy Nicole Heeszel,28,6,1307,"The more I connect with others regarding my mental health journey, the more I realize that people find that the discrepancies between an anxiety attack and a panic attack are not so easy to define. In fact, many folks believe that a panic attack is a synonymous term for an anxiety attack and vice versa. They do sound alike, don‚Äôt they? What even is the difference between panic and anxiety anyway? Don‚Äôt they always play hand in hand? Do both involve the universal sensation of fear?What people forget is that fear comes in many types with different intensities, causes, and characteristics, and they can certainly exhibit varying signs and symptoms.Even early on when I first started to deal with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) over a decade ago, I didn‚Äôt even quite understand the difference. Like many, I used panic and anxiety interchangeably. However, in 2014, I began to understand what made the two different once I started struggling with frequent panic attacks myself. It is due to this common misunderstanding that led me to create this blog post.The easiest way I can describe an anxiety attack is a period of anxiety, which may range from moderate to severe. These normally begin with worry of some sort like a fear of speaking to an audience or attending a job interview. While most people struggle with some type of anxiety, worry, and fear from time to time, anxiety is often more intense than your average period of distress. The worry itself can be impairing to the point where you may have difficulty concentrating and doing anything except think about what you‚Äôre anxious about at the moment. Anxiety attacks can be due to something medical, can be a result of different anxiety disorders, or can be brought on psychologically.Some symptoms might include:For me personally, I would experience anxiety waking up in the morning before school, prior to taking a test or talking out loud / in front of the class, while at an appointment of any kind, during phone calls with strangers, and while interacting with most males. These were all things I knew scared me and made me go outside of my comfort zone.An anxiety attack can last hours, a day or two, or even weeks or months at a time before subsiding. They can occur during an event or near a stimulus that you are frightened of or can occur months before you know you will come in contact with it. For instance, if someone is scheduled to go to the doctor six months from now, they may suffer from anxiety that comes and go or stay and slowly intensify the closer the appointment comes. Generally, experiencing an anxiety attack is sometimes similar to the sensation of tripping over a step or reaching into your pocket and realizing that your phone isn‚Äôt there.Commonly, people find panic attacks much scarier than an anxiety attack. The symptoms of panic usually include stronger anxiety symptoms, can either be more or less variant, and typically affect your life and day-to-day tasks more than general anxiety. In fact, many describe a panic attack like they are having a heart attack, even though they are not the same. A panic attack might begin as an anxiety attack, it might ignite suddenly when you are exposed to a certain stimulus (e.g., a loud sound), or it may simply come out of the blue for no apparent reason. Panic attacks can be a result of trauma or abuse, due to dealing with long-lived and serious anxiety, or might even be a result of something medical like a vitamin deficiency or hormonal balance.Some symptoms might include:For many folks, having a panic attack is such a handicapping, excessive experience that one usually cannot focus on or do anything else while they are struggling with the attack. It is far more debilitating than everyday stress and a much stronger anxiety response to the point where one might believe their health is in immediate danger. At this stage, their brain is in a full-fledged fight-or-flight response, and its main goal is to protect them from perceived danger. During a panic attack, your body doesn‚Äôt want or expect you to sit through a wedding, sing on stage, shop in a store, or conduct your normal day-to-day activities; it wants you to run, hide, or fight for your life (or better yet, make you think you need to). In the midst of panic, you want so badly to escape but usually don‚Äôt know why or where to go; you truly feel like nowhere is safe, not even in your own skin.After I began struggling with panic attacks after dealing with long-lasting, severe anxiety, I couldn‚Äôt continue to drive, count back change at work, and eventually, leave the house (agoraphobia) because I was so afraid of having another panic attack outside of my ‚Äúsafe zone.‚Äù Nowadays when I struggle with panic, usually all it takes is the exposure of stimuli that caused or exasperated my panic from the start (e.g., driving, going to work, leaving my neighborhood, etc.), even if the stimuli that trigger my attacks aren‚Äôt things that would normally make me anxious or do not currently make me anxious the way they used to. However, there are also periods where I experience an anxiety attack, and it turns into a panic attack.The good news is, panic attacks, while they are often much more debilitating than general anxiety, usually only last a few minutes to a half hour rather than several days at a time. Still, panic attacks can occur every now and then or may occur multiple times a day. Some may feel the aftereffects of a panic attack for months (i.e., feeling on edge) until they learn how to accept control their fear and panic.All in all, while anxiety and panic attacks have their similarities as they both involve anxiety and various symptoms of anxiety from sweating to a pounding heart or accelerated heart rate, panic is a stronger form of anxiety, or really, an exasperated component of it. Unlike anxiety, panic attacks can include some or all of the common symptoms of anxiety plus an extreme fear that you‚Äôve lost control over your thoughts and actions, may die in the midst of the attack, and might very well have ‚Äúno way out.‚ÄùEither way, both are fear-based and involve feelings of restlessness or overstimulation, even when there is a medical cause or contributor to the panic or anxiety. Likewise, both can have the same or similar triggers whether they be social, situational, mental, physical, and so on and so forth. The two additionally can be expected or completely unexpected. Anxiety and panic can be apart of a mental health disorder and last long-term, or they may act temporary symptoms, not apart of a disorder at all. Regardless, health is always a concern with panic and anxiety whether it be merely psychological or mainly a physiological problem. Thus, they are both something that need to be addressed one way or another.Those who struggle with anxiety or its associated mental disorders may have an increased risk of developing panic attacks or a series of phobias in the future if they 1) do not get help for their anxiety and 2) fail to do anything to ease their anxiety by making necessary lifestyle changes.Due to the latter statement, I urge people struggling with anxiety to get help in any ways that they whether it be taking medication prescribed by a doctor, attending therapy or counseling, eating healthier, or seeing a holistic practitioner for natural treatment. Both anxiety and panic can come and go or can increasingly get worse over time without being addressed. The sooner you are able to treat your anxiety and figure out why it‚Äôs occurring, the sooner you may be able to heal and find mental freedom.Originally published at http://theworriedwordsmith.blogspot.com.",31/05/2019,0,0,7,3,1050,787,1,2,0,3,41
Why the Tech Giants Can‚Äôt Save the News,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-the-tech-giants-cant-save-the-news-b0f72b9fa98d,Rob Healy,76,11,2437,"Podiem Paper #1: ADDITION BY SUBTRACTION#ThePodiemPapers are an ongoing series of short essays aimed at heightening the public conversation around core issues intersecting journalism and social media.__________________________________________________________________We are at a tenuous and fragile inflection point in our country‚Äôs history. A point in which the very idea of what it means to ‚Äúreport the news‚Äù is under siege, print journalism is dying a quick and painful death, and televised news now more closely resembles WWF-Kabuki theater rather than any sort of productive public discourse.Meanwhile, ad-revenues for print journalism continue their 20 year decline save for the very few legacy outfits (NYT et al.). 1/5th of all local newspapers have shut their doors in the last decade. 2,700 American journalists lost their jobs in 2019 alone in what Business Insider is calling a Media Landslide. Just wait. It gets worse.Fake News and its complimentary antecedent, Conspiracy Theorizing, are both growing rapidly in their precision and effectiveness, wreaking havoc on liberal democracies at a global scale and will most certainly continue to be an inescapable fact of American political life for the foreseeable future. With the oncoming wave of deep-fakes and the growing profitability of ideology-driven news, the long-term prospectus for the news media landscape is looking bleak. Dystopian-Toxic-Wasteland bleak.One only needs to look at a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report showing PR professionals outnumbering journalists 6‚Äì1, jumping to 12‚Äì1 in the coming decade. Bottom-line takeaway being that the persuasion game is becoming more lucrative by the minute. The truth-telling game, not so much.And now, in journalism‚Äôs absence, we are turning to the software developers to save us. We have tasked the tech giants with doing the difficult messy work of reality gate-keeping. Deciphering truth from fiction, separating out what is real from what is merely pretending to be.The tech companies in turn (who could fairly be blamed for at least some of this journalistic collapse to begin with) have been tasked with rescuing journalism from its downward spiral and saving our democracy in the process.A herculean task if only it was limited to the readership of The Albuquerque Journal or The Fresno Bee. The entire industrialized free world on the other hand is near impossible. Don‚Äôt feel bad though. Remember no one asked Facebook and Twitter to stretch their tentacles globally before they figured out whether their product was a net-force for good. Move Fast and Break Things and all the rest. They brought this on themselves to be sure.And so now, the tech giants will predictably do the only thing they know how to do or could reasonably be expected to do. They will turn to filters and algorithms and AI and deep learning models to synthesize our global data and determine what is ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù for our communal consumption, all while maintaining some sense of global scale (see: shareholder profits).My not so bold prediction: They will get this wrong. And it will end disastrously.They will get it wrong not because they are inherently selfish people (although some of them may be) or because they are stupid (ditto again here). Nor should they be fairly asked to fund all the news desks from Chennai to Mumbai.Even with the best of intentions and plentiful resources, they will still get it wrong for a much more fundamental reason. They will fail because real ‚Äúreporting‚Äù evades coding constructs and logic rules by its very definition.This inability to define news in concrete ways, ways that the tech companies can translate into yes/no ‚Äî on/off ‚Äî 1/0 categories at scale, is a feature, not a bug of journalism. A function of the fact that news reporting belongs not to the world of objective data transmission, but to the world of the subjective dark-arts. On the continuum of magical sophistry at one end and deep mathematical proofs on the other, news reporting has much more in common with Hogwarts than MIT.The tech companies of course know this, they just are scared of admitting it out loud. To do so would be to acknowledge that they were all too giddy to rub the lamp how many ever years ago without a clue as to how to put the genie back in, or control it once he got out.Yet, Twitter‚Äôs recent accidental internal leak admitting that any filters for Nazism on the platform would catch prominent GOP politicians in its filter-net while Facebook‚Äôs stuttering and back-heeled half measures regarding Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs doctored slurred speech video that went viral only drive home this point even further.What I want to argue here is that the above issues are only the tip of the iceberg. What waits for the programmers at the bottom of this rabbit hole are deep philosophical questions that elude the boundaries of formal logic all together. That there exists a whole host of epistemic dilemmas that don‚Äôt get any easier from here on out. Facebook‚Äôs and Twitter‚Äôs easiest programming days are now firmly behind them.I want to spend the remainder of this essay focusing on just one of these epistemic dilemmas in order to underscore how complicated of a world we now are wading into. That dilemma is illuminated by the journalistic practice of Addition-by-Subtraction. The idea that the kind of reporting that actually informs and shapes liberal democracies exists not in the combined synthesis of data-sets but in the synthesis of the data set‚Äôs subtraction. The actual work of ‚Äúreal‚Äù journalists is not merely just to interpret the data in front of them and then decide what to do with it (if x then y), but often more profoundly, their job is to interpret what is missing from the data set. To differentiate between the literal truth of the moment, and the larger truth of the story.This conundrum is not new of course. Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein spent their lives fudging around with it. As did Foucault and Derrida after them. And they all hover around the idea that there are near infinite number of ways to interpret a sentence, a paragraph, a page, book, a play, a movie, a work of art, a song etc.Yes, there are clearly some ways of interpreting a sentence or poem or novel that are more ‚Äúright‚Äù than others. But how do we go about codifying that interpretation game? How do we structurally create a set of software rules for say, just linguistic interpretation, especially if the language itself is self-contradictory? The AI community has been struggling with this since the 80‚Äôs. If only all language could fall neatly into the ‚ÄúAll men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore‚Ä¶‚Äù syllogisms, we wouldn‚Äôt have any of these problems. Unfortunately, until our robot overlords can create these scalable meta-truth filters, journalists and authors are all we have to help us muddle through the muck.More simply stated, we are unnervingly reliant upon journalists to be our tour-guides through the murky forests of these interpretive and contradictory language games. We need them to make sure that we don‚Äôt all collectively walk away from reading Romeo and Juliet thinking that we should probably just kill ourselves if our lover dies.To see exactly how much of this interpretive contradiction game takes place inside of a realm that formal logic cannot penetrate, a realm that the (muggles) software engineers are incapable of entering, take as an example the following scene from the 1996 British Film, Brassed Off.At the end of a date, Andy (Ewan McGregor) brings Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) back to her apartment. Just as they are about to part ways, Gloria asks Andy, ‚ÄúDo you want to come up for coffee?‚Äù Andy, locking eye contact, shoots back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drink coffee.‚Äù Without missing a beat Gloria responds, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got any.‚Äùhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRAGb-6wAvkThe philosopher Slavoj Zizek artfully uses this story to illustrate the idea that when you subtract the coffee from their conversation, you aren‚Äôt left with ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. Instead, almost as if by magic, what you are left with is an openly erotic proposition. When you subtract the coffee, you get a true sense of what the entire interaction was to begin with. The subtraction creates the story.Do not be confused. This isn‚Äôt just some COMM‚Äôs 101 lesson in context and subtext. This is something much deeper. The language game being employed here can only be fully understood once the language has been negated. The full intention of her inviting Andy up for coffee is unveiled only after the linguistic subtraction. Some socio-linguistic equivalent in summing two negative integers to get a positive.Imagine a situation where a deep learning algorithm encounters this dialogue. What would it make of what had just transpired? Imagine how limited the scope of their interpretive framework would be when pressed up against the glass of the addition-by-subtraction game. Imagine how disastrously wrong an unsophisticated filter would interpret the above events. Would it quickly resort to things like pupil dilation and cheek-blood-flushing and the millions of other hidden physiological cues that give away intentionality in order to fill in the blanks?In reality of course, there is only one version that is ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù in capturing Gloria‚Äôs true intentions. Namely, that she wants to shake-the-sheets with Andy while still giving herself a respectable ‚Äúout‚Äù if he is not interested, thus saving herself from the social embarrassment of rejection. This intention is not new or novel or especially complicated. These kinds of romantic interplays have been going on for centuries. Rather, it‚Äôs the sentences Gloria is stringing together that hang on a tapestry of innuendo and evolving cultural context that are revelatory and novel. And software algorithms are hopelessly lost when it comes time to sift through this type of dialogue.And this is just a simple Man-meets-Woman scenario. Imagine what happens if you add something complex into the mix with multiple actors and institutions operating on a geo-political and cultural level. Take for example the old 1960‚Äôs Soviet joke during which grocery store shelves ran empty for months at a time.A young man walks into a grocery store and looks around.He asks the salesman, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any meat?‚ÄùThe salesman responds, ‚ÄúNo comrade. We don‚Äôt have any fish. It‚Äôs the store across the street that doesn‚Äôt have any meat!‚ÄùThe punchline of the joke doesn‚Äôt just rest on some linguistic trick, although it does have that feature. Instead, the point of the joke holds within it two, much deeper insights that can only be accessed via the addition-by-subtraction method. The first analysis being that there in fact used to exist a world where the distinction between the store without fish and the store without meat actually mattered and that 1960‚Äôs Soviet communism has since destroyed that distinction. Made it irrelevant. And then comes the deeper level of analysis that sees this lack of distinction between stores as a much grander metaphor for the identity-stripping death-of-distinction-syndrome that rested at the heart of all of Soviet government-controlled society at the time. All differences and distinctions in individuation were made irrelevant. There is only the state.Here we see the addition-by-subtraction technique creating a deep and complicated backstory that reveals itself to the audience only after all the linguistic ingredients have been stripped away.I use these two examples because they are cute and clever and prove my point. And if you are inclined to be a member of the pro-algorithm pro-tech community, you might rightfully say, ‚ÄúDeep learning models actually can make very reasonable and accurate assessments of the above scenarios.‚ÄùThat is why I find the following NPR interview with Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA so instructive. Both institutions for which the stakes of the addition-by-subtraction game couldn‚Äôt be higher. Where an accurate understanding of data is the difference between foiling a terrorist plot or not. His responses are illuminating.Reporter: ‚ÄúDo you see a future world where we don‚Äôt need human assets on the ground gathering intelligence? A future perhaps where AI and computers and drones can aggregate all this data for us safely and more accurately?‚ÄùHayden: ‚ÄúNo. At least not anytime soon. The problem with intelligence gathering is that it‚Äôs often what is not said, what goes unspoken, that is far more instructive than what is actually in the transcript. To make sense of the unspoken most often requires raw HUMINT (human based intelligence). People who are familiar with the actors and the context. And the contextualizing of that ‚Äúunspoken‚Äù, the conversation in between the lines, happens all the way from the boots on the ground to Langley and at every step in between.‚ÄùMy point is that all of this is not some esoteric diatribe on the philosophical endpoints of news reporting. Rather that it all has very real-world implications with practical real-world consequences. And we are unconsciously pushing out the people whose very job it is to establish standards and protocols and best practices for discerning what the actual addition-by-subtraction game is on the ground floor.It would be as if we all collectively demanded that the CIA get rid of its agents, sources, and covert operatives, so as to only use drones from here on out because we couldn‚Äôt stomach the messiness of human based sources. Could we be upset with them if our intelligence gathering capabilities were severely hindered and grave consequences came as a result? Is journalism really all that different?And so, it should scare all of us that we are handing over this difficult and messy and integral civic responsibility to the tech companies. Tech companies whose market incentives are coldly indifferent to what our collective take away from Romeo and Juliet is. They only care that you read it and share it and post it and argue about it and comment on it and do it all over again the next day.Actual real journalism, the kind that lets you know if your politicians are compromised or a corporation is cheating its customers or whether there is lead in your town‚Äôs drinking water, is an imperfect dark art. Reporter‚Äôs entire careers have been ruined for millimeter mistakes and yet I don‚Äôt think it would be hyperbolic to say that whole democracies have been saved by way of their millimeter victories. Millimeter victories that were won often times by seeing what existed beneath the text, what was hiding in between the language.If we do in fact take it as true that those millimeter victories happen by way of tedious, human-centric, addition-by-subtraction reporting, then the question we should all be asking ourselves is whether or not we think the tech giants seem truly committed to that cause. Sincerely invested in helping us all distinguish between the store without fish from the store without meat.Or perhaps more importantly, do we think they‚Äôre capable of even being able to tell the difference?",30/05/2019,0,0,8,35,586,408,4,0,0,6,26
Turn Your Productivity on Autopilot,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/turn-your-productivity-on-autopilot-6e389e26f1bb,Jenna Cook,72,8,1638,"Have you ever wondered how some people get so much done? You may think they have superhuman willpower, but I‚Äôm here to tell you that‚Äôs not the case. The most successful and productive people know how to make habits work for them, and you can do.Think of your willpower as a battery. When you wake up, refreshed from a full night‚Äôs sleep, your willpower is at full charge. Now, as you go about your day, your willpower is drained by almost every conscious decision you must make. ‚ÄúConscious‚Äù is the keyword here.Treat your willpower as a valuable, fleeting resource.If every morning when you wake up, you are in the habit of brewing coffee, taking a shower, and brushing your teeth, then those actions are already ingrained and not something you need to make a conscious decision to do. These activities are routine, or habits, and do not tax your mental willpower. Your battery is still at full charge.On the other hand, if eating breakfast is only something you do when, say, you aren‚Äôt running late, and today you happen to be running on time, and then you decide you are going to, in fact, eat breakfast before shuffling off to work, then this situation is a different story entirely. Since you don‚Äôt always eat breakfast, you now have to decide what you can prepare depending on what‚Äôs hanging around in your kitchen. You must also consider how much time you actually have to prepare said meal. Don‚Äôt have anything at home? Now you need to decide what drive-thru or cafe you‚Äôre going to stop by, and of course, pick something off the menu when you are there.Whew. That‚Äôs a lot of brainpower for something you think should be easy. It‚Äôs not even 8 am and you have already had to navigate a complicated decision about how to feed yourself. This entire thought process has effectively drained a little bit of your precious willpower, and you haven‚Äôt even set foot in the office (or workplace), where, for most, the more difficult decisions will start to arise.You want to keep your iPhone battery as close to 100 percent as possible, and you should want the same for your willpower, especially since your decision-making capacity doesn‚Äôt come with a lightning cable. Willpower is precious! You need to preserve where you can, so when you face hard decisions or difficult problems, you‚Äôre able to stand strong and work through them.So, we‚Äôve established you absolutely should start your most productive part of the day with a full battery. But how?Let‚Äôs circle back to the beginning of the breakfast-decision example. Remember how I said that taking a shower, brewing coffee, and brushing your teeth were ingrained parts of your morning routine? Well these ingrained actions, or habits, are a magic productivity tool that allows us to get sh*t done without having to overthink it.Overthinking everyday decisions sucks. It wastes unnecessary mental energy and causes frustration over things that don‚Äôt really matter. Habits are awesome because they help us create routines and accomplish productive and necessary tasks without giving it a second thought.When you think of your daily routine, how many habits come to mind? Here are a few common things that most of us do daily: bathing, shaving, applying makeup, getting dressed, making your bed, eating breakfast, preparing lunches for yourself/partner/children, drinking coffee/tea, commuting to work, etc.Now, how many of the things that you do would be considered routine? How many of these do you have to consciously make a decision about? Knowing where you stand is a good starting point.Let‚Äôs do a quick exercise. Take a sheet of paper and draw a table with two labels: Unconscious Decisions and Conscious Decisions. Now take your daily activities and write each one under the appropriate heading. The more activities under the Conscious heading mean more willpower-draining decisions. We don‚Äôt want that.If your table is heavy on the decision-making side, creating solid habits can move those tasks into unconscious territory and make your life easier on a daily basis.I want to help you get into the habit of creating useful habits. The process of creating a new habit drains willpower, but only until it becomes ingrained. So how do we go about creating these habits?The first step is the most important step. Are you ready for it? Okay, you need to start with ONE habit you want to develop ‚Äî yes, just one thing you want to change ‚Äî and focus on making that one thing a totally ingrained habit before moving on the next. A lot of people overlook the importance of this first step and try to change a lot of things at once. This approach is overwhelming to most people and often leads to failing to implement any new habits at all (except in the case of what I call ‚Äúhabit un-stacking‚Äù, which I will get to later).Let‚Äôs start with an example: Janelle wants to spend less time looking at social media. She often uses it as a distraction from things she should be doing, and it is noticeably cutting into her productivity during the day.Now, Janelle needs to make a conscious decision to focus on creating this habit. Once she‚Äôs set her intentions, she should start small. If she normally spends 3+ hours per day taking and sending dog-filtered photos on Snapchat, it‚Äôs unrealistic that she could go all day without checking her snaps. Janelle knows this and vows to only look at her social media sites for a designated 30-minute period at the end of her day after she‚Äôs eaten dinner.Janelle is going strong, but those negative thoughts slowly start to creep in‚Ä¶‚ÄúI could just check Snapchat for five minutes, and then I‚Äôll go right back to work.‚Äù‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to look at Instagram today, but Maria got engaged and I have to see the ring.‚ÄùSound familiar? These thoughts are going to run through your mind when trying to develop a new habit. The trick is to learn to banish them immediately. If you truly believe that failure is not an option, then it won‚Äôt be.Remember earlier when I said to get into the mindset of treating your willpower as a battery? Getting into the right mindset is super important here as well. You are strong and you can do this. Don‚Äôt let competing thoughts tell you otherwise.So Janelle really wants to spend less time scrolling through Instagram like a brain-dead zombie, but she always has her phone on her, and, girl, the temptation is real. So, what should she do?There are a few things Janelle can do to tweak her environment and make success more likely. A few examples include logging out of all of her social media accounts, deleting the apps off her phone (or even just removing them from the home screen), using an app that limits your social media time, placing her phone out of sight while working, telling her friends about her goal and having them call her out if they see her online.Forming a new habit can be hard. Make the process as easy as possible, especially early on when habit formation is most draining.Janelle usually uses her 30-minute lunch break to grab a to-go gyro and scroll through her newsfeed, but this mid-day social media break is no longer an option. So what should she do? If you associate one habit with another habit, it may be time to break both.I‚Äôll use a personal example here. In 2018, I decided to quit smoking. But you know what always, and without a doubt, caused me the urge to smoke? Drinking alcohol. If the smoking was to go, so was wine, so I ditched my buzz-inducing drinks for the first few weeks until the association between the two started to weaken and fade.Since Janelle already associates her lunch breaks with social media time, she should implement a new lunch break routine. Instead of going to the takeout place around the corner, she could walk to a restaurant a few blocks away. The extra time spent walking will decrease her thinking about getting online, and there‚Äôs the added bonus of getting some extra exercise.Make it through the first day of sticking to your new habit? Instead of feeling overwhelmed that it‚Äôs only been one day, celebrate your accomplishment! It‚Äôs a much better mentality to look at how far you‚Äôve come, rather than how far you have to go. If you feel proud of yourself, and recognize that small changes can lead to big changes, you are much more likely to keep the momentum going and stick to your habit.Developing this habit can allow you to supercharge your productivity. So what‚Äôs exactly is this awesome habit we should all implement? Get into the habit of doing your most important task first before accomplishing anything else (that requires willpower that is). Yes, it‚Äôs that simple. This means that after you‚Äôve gone through your set morning routine, you should tackle whatever your absolute must-accomplish task of the day is. This guarantees that it will get done, and you won‚Äôt have a chance to procrastinate once your willpower is running on empty, and when the thought of a Netflix binge is almost undeniable.For many of us, our most important task of the day can be the most tedious (say finalizing and submitting the budget for a new project) or mentally-draining (coming up with the overall creative idea for your next campaign). I can guarantee that tasks are not something you‚Äòll want to do after toiling at work for seven and a half hours or running time-consuming errands all day. Tackle your most important task first and watch your productivity skyrocket!There you have it, I hope with this knowledge you can develop and nurture amazing habits that will help you take over the world (or whatever it is you hope to accomplish).",31/05/2019,1,0,8,15,1050,885,3,1,0,6,127
How to Live in the Present and Make Your Time Count,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-live-in-the-present-and-make-your-time-count-830e670f3060,Leon Ho,2100,6,1395,"How to make the most of the time you have in a day.When you woke up this morning, you had a whole day ahead of you. And, when you go to bed, that same day will have passed.This is just how time works, isn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôre losing time every second; and try as you may, you can never turn the clock back.Time is such a precious and limited resource, yet often we neglect or abuse it, thinking that there‚Äôs still time left. We‚Äôre sometimes so focused on the wrong priorities that we end up spending our precious time on things that won‚Äôt matter in the long run. And, we may not be spending enough time on the things that do matter.Have you ever reflected on how you‚Äôre spending your waking moments?Maybe you could use more time in the day to get more work done. Or perhaps you crave spending more time with your family, but always feel overwhelmed with everything on your plate. You might have always wanted to start a hobby, or try something new, but never had the time to because of existing responsibilities.Well, if you don‚Äôt start now‚Ä¶ will you ever? Ask yourself, ‚Äòam I really living my best life?‚ÄôBelow are a few techniques to help you be more aware of your time spent, and how to truly make every second count.Mindfulness can sometimes be a vague term. People often try to be mindful, or in the present, when on holidays, or when spending time with their loved ones. But, what does it really mean to be mindful of the present?Well, it simply means to bring awareness to what you‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a practice that trains your brain to be more efficient and better integrated with your surroundings, so you‚Äôre less distracted and more focused. It also helps to minimize stress and allows you to become your best self.So how can you practice mindfulness?It need not take up any of your free time. You can practice mindfulness during routine activities such as when you‚Äôre brushing your teeth, taking a shower, eating breakfast or walking to work. Zoom in on the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and feelings of these activities that you would otherwise be doing on auto-pilot.A good time to practice is first thing in the morning when you wake up, as it helps set the ‚Äòtone‚Äô of your nervous system for the rest of the day, increasing the likelihood of other mindful moments.One thing to note is that when you‚Äôre practicing mindfulness, it‚Äôs okay to let your mind wander. You don‚Äôt always need to be aware, as the act of noticing that your mind has wandered, and then bringing it back to awareness is in itself beneficial.Our brains respond better to bursts of mindfulness, so it‚Äôs better to be mindful several times a day, rather than a lengthy one hour session, or even going to weekend retreats. For example, you could focus on how your feet feel in those shoes as you‚Äôre walking to work, or how your throat and tongue feels when you‚Äôre sipping on your morning coffee. These only take mere minutes of awareness.Lastly, the best way to cultivate mindfulness in everyday life is to train yourself to meditate. Practicing meditation is learning the language of being present, and helps us tap into mindfulness with little effort.Besides practicing mindfulness, it‚Äôs also beneficial to appreciate what you have in your life at this very moment.Whatever you‚Äôre doing, whether it‚Äôs a fun project or a mundane task, appreciate every moment of it, and make an effort to find the enjoyable aspects within it. For example, when walking to your car or to work, really feel the sensations of the pavement on your feet, the breeze in the air, the sights around you.Anything can be enjoyable if you train yourself to see it that way. This can also be applied to doing laundry, washing dishes, or filing taxes!You don‚Äôt need to only be grateful for the big things in life like money or material possessions. It‚Äôs the little things in life that if you can appreciate and find meaning in, you‚Äôre one step closer to truly living in the moment.Stop MultitaskingNow this is a controversial one. It used to be that if you could multitask, you were seen as being more efficient and getting more done in less time. However these days, most productivity gurus would agree that multitasking is not the way to go about with efficiency. Shocked?Scroll down to continue reading articleWell, the simple explanation is that when you multitask, your concentration or attention is being split with the number of things you‚Äôre trying to get done. As a result, you‚Äôre actually less focused on each task which results in lower productivity, and likely more time needed or lower quality results.So as much as you want to save time, it‚Äôs better to focus on one task at a time. When you feel the urge to switch to other tasks, pause, breathe, and pull yourself back into the single task you are currently focusing on.Often, when we spend time with others, we‚Äôre not really there with them. Physically, we may be present, but a lot of times we‚Äôre distracted by our phones or other devices. If not these, we might be distracted in our minds-thinking about the errands we need to run, or the email we need to reply to, or the dinner plans that we have the next evening.Other times we may listen, but we‚Äôre actually thinking about ourselves and what we want to say to the person. This is all pretty common human behavior that most of us are guilty of, but the good news is that with effort, you can shut off the outside world and just be present with the people you‚Äôre spending time with.This is a more effective use of your time and helps you connect with people rather than just being in the presence of them. Most people appreciate a deeper connection, especially with those whom they value, so really take time to make that happen.Now, this is a common tip of which you‚Äôre probably familiar. But, it‚Äôs also really helpful- especially when you‚Äôre finding yourself constantly distracted at work, or at home while trying to relax.It‚Äôs useful to disconnect from your phone so that you can focus on other things. The advantage to being connected all the time, of course, is that you have constant and immediate access to news, information, and alerts. But, the downside of that is also that it means you‚Äôre at the mercy of those incoming demands and alerts. You become accustomed to immediate responses, sometimes at the expense of other experiences.Professor Leslie Parlow of Harvard Business School found in a study that of 1,600 managers and professionals, 70% said they check their phones within an hour of waking up; 56% check their phone within an hour of going to sleep; 51% check their phone continuously during vacation; and 44% said they would experience ‚Äòa great deal of anxiety‚Äô if they lost their phone and couldn‚Äôt replace it for a week.You may argue that you‚Äôre not spending your time playing games or going on Facebook, but instead doing something more valuable. But, it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre doing that matters as much as the time you lose when you switch back to a task.When distracted by your phone, and acted upon, it takes up to 23 minutes to get back to the level of concentration where you left off before the interruption. So, if you let your phone interrupt you every 10 minutes, think about how much time and resources you‚Äôve lost in a day?At the end of the day, we all have a limited amount of time on earth, so we should strive to make the most of it.That doesn‚Äôt mean we should be rushing and trying to do everything at once, so that we forget to smell the roses, be present with our loved ones and appreciate the little things in life.It‚Äôs more important to know that the time you‚Äôre spending is spent meaningfully, and that you‚Äôre prioritizing the right things. If you haven‚Äôt been living in the present, the time is now!Start practicing some of the tips I‚Äôve shared above and watch your life transform slowly, as you move towards making every second count.Photo by Djim LoicOriginally published at https://www.lifehack.org on May 30, 2019.

How to Provide Support to a Grieving Friend,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-provide-support-to-a-grieving-friend-631cde4df8e3,"Jenni Brennan, Changing Perspectives",154,5,1058,"Beyond casseroles and meal trainsWhen someone we know loses a loved one, their support network instantly kicks into high gear. Food trains get organized. Go Fund Me accounts get created. Casseroles get tossed into ovens. We make phone calls to and spend time at the homes of the grievers. We show up at wakes, funerals, and memorials and give our best condolences, whispering ‚ÄúLet me know if you need anything.‚ÄùWe really do a great job, right?Not quite.While we, as a society, do a great job in the initial days following a death, our support quickly fades away, leaving our friends who have suffered the loss of their loved one to suffer yet another loss ‚Äî the loss of their support network.It turns out that a peculiar thing happens when someone dies. The loved ones left behind are too overwhelmed to know how to ask for help or even what to ask for that would give them support. So, they ask for nothing, waiting for their friends to instinctively know what to do. Meanwhile, their friends go silent, assuming that their grieving friends will call them when they are needed. So often these miscommunications and missed opportunities result in heartache, pain, and fractured friendships.It‚Äôs not surprising to see our inadequacies around providing support to a grieving friend. We are a death denying society. We don‚Äôt like to talk about death, dying or grief. It feels too heavy, messy and personal and when something makes us feel uncomfortable, our natural instinct is to turn away from it, stick our heads in the sand, and hope that it gets better over time. So, we show up at the beginning do all the things that society has told us are helpful and then we retreat, waiting for our grieving friend to take the lead.As a grief therapist, I spend my days holding space for grieving individuals. They spend their time with me crying, not just about their dead loved one but also about their friends who stopped showing up after the first few weeks of their grief. They feel more alone than ever before and are often quite shocked at how ill-prepared their support network seems to have been for them.If you are like most people I know, you would love to feel more equipped at how to best help your grieving friends. You don‚Äôt ever want your friend to feel like you abandoned them. Start by putting down the casseroles. Don‚Äôt send that text message that says ‚ÄúLet me know if I can do anything for you.‚Äù Instead, try one or more of the following tips to provide support to your grieving friend. It could be the greatest gift you ever give to someone.1. Be thereThere are few things in life that can make you feel as powerless as watching someone you love have their heart broken. For many of us, we can only spend so much time in that uncomfortable place before we need find something to distract ourselves. Rather than running away from the pain, try to lean in to that discomfort and be there for your friend. Remind them that you care about them and will be there for them. There are no magic words you can say to make things better. Just being there with them physically is sometimes magical enough.2. Ask questionsAsk your friend what they need. Rather than saying ‚Äúlet me know if you need anything‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here if you need me,‚Äù be brave and ask things like ‚ÄúWhat will be the hardest part of this month for you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do you need to help you get through the season?‚Äù Encourage your friend to be honest with you about their needs.3. Find a way to help, without being asked‚ÄãFor many grieving individuals, the thought of asking for support is overwhelming, daunting and feels far too vulnerable for them. While they may benefit from having someone take their children to and from school, fix that old broken rock wall, pull out their summer patio furniture, or help with projects around the house, chances are pretty low that they will ever ask for that kind of help. Figure out a way, besides casseroles, that you can provide some functional help to your friend and then offer it.4. Talk about their loved oneFor many of us, we have been conditioned to avoid talking about someone who has died. We don‚Äôt want to upset our friends and remind them of their loss. We don‚Äôt want to make their pain worse. Guess what? They probably are always thinking about their loved one. Their heart is always hurting. One of their biggest fears, especially if they are a parent who has lost a child, is that the world (and they, themselves) will forget their loved one. Say their name. If you knew them, talk about your memories of them. Talking about them will give your friend permission to also talk about them and doing so will help immensely with their grief process.5. Include themEven though your friend may not feel much like socializing at times, continue to extend invitations. Don‚Äôt assume that just because they have declined your last four invitations means they will never be interested in hanging out with you again. That 5th invitation just may be the one that finally gets them out of their house.6. Don‚Äôt take it personalWhen your friend turns down your invitation to your summer bbq, backs out of your girls‚Äô night out at the last minute, or doesn‚Äôt return your text message right away, don‚Äôt take it personal. Sometimes grieving individuals simply don‚Äôt have the energy to socialize and it has nothing to do with their level of desire to spend time with you.When it comes to grief, there is no such thing is closure. There is no such thing as moving on. Your friend will always feel some level of grief about their lost loved one. Some days that loss may feel as heavy as a boulder, completely weighing them down. Other days it may feel like a small pebble in their pocket. No matter how heavy or light their grief may feel from day to day, the griever will still feel its presence every day for the rest of their life. Wouldn‚Äôt it be wonderful for your grieving friend to feel your supportive presence beside them through it all?",31/05/2019,0,0,7,1,1050,682,1,0,0,0,31
3 Keys to ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù Away Daily Stress,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/3-keys-to-drive-away-daily-stress-910becf1a565,Steven Hopper,1500,5,1209,"‚ÄúI, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I‚Äôm going to be happy in it.‚Äù ‚Äî Groucho MarxDo you ever feel like life is too much to handle?Like everyone is treating you unfairly and you just can‚Äôt catch a break?Like you‚Äôd rather stay in bed than face the realities that are waiting to pounce as soon as you step out the door?I know I‚Äôve felt this way throughout many parts of this year. But I know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way. The stress of life is just part of the game and everyone deals with it. But, I won‚Äôt lie, there were times when I was depressed. When I felt defeated and like life was getting the best of me. When I wanted to ask ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù, as if life owed me the courtesy of saving these problems for someone else.But then I remembered something important from a book I read last year called The Energy Bus by Jon Gordon.The ‚Äúbus‚Äù of course is a metaphor for life. You drive your bus to different destinations, in all kinds of weather, and with all kinds of passengers. The question, though, is are you driving your bus or are you letting someone or something else drive you?If you want to live the most stress-free and happy life, then here are the most important takeaways to remember each and every day:You have to focus your time and energy into your personal vision for your life. Every day is a chance to get one step closer to realizing the version of yourself you aspire to be ‚Äî Where do you want to go? Who do you want to become? How do you want to be remembered?Remember to drive your life with intention. You are in charge of the destinations, the passengers, and yes, even the road trip playlist. It‚Äôs easy to think that when one part of life is out of our control that all parts of life must be out of our control, but that‚Äôs not true. So focus on taking charge of everything you can and you‚Äôll minimize the effect of the parts that you can‚Äôt.I spent too long letting these uncontrollable life circumstances affect my mood and attitude every day until I realized how I let them take full control of my life. I had to put myself back in the driver‚Äôs seat. Instead of letting this or that problem ruin my day, I chose to focus on other areas of my life where things were going great and suddenly, the bad wasn‚Äôt so bad anymore.Nothing else matters unless you first take charge of driving your bus. Remember that you‚Äôre ultimately the person in control of your life‚Äôs course.‚ÄúFind joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs your responsibility to love it, or change it.‚Äù ‚Äî Chuck PalahnuikFacing difficulty in life is inevitable. Everyone will certainly experience pain and hardship at some point. But, that fact alone isn‚Äôt the bad news. It‚Äôs how you handle those challenges that determines whether they control your life or you control them. So remember this formula:E + R = OEvents + Reaction = OutcomeThis simple equation was inspired by Jack Canfield, author of The Success Principles. It‚Äôs a perfect reminder that the results of your life depend on how you react to whatever life throws your way.Life is all about choosing to think positively in every situation, to see the good instead of dwelling on the bad. This is exactly what I had to do to break out of the downward spiral.This mindset shift alone alleviated most of the stress, because it was my own negative thoughts that caused my anxiety in the first place. Once I honed in on the good things going on in life, the skies brightened and happiness emerged from behind the dark clouds.Positivity is a choice you have to make, every day, no matter what else is going on. Be the person who smiles and greets life with excitement and focuses not on the problems, but on the opportunities. It just may surprise you the difference that positive thinking can make.‚ÄúBad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have ‚Äî life itself.‚Äù ‚Äî Walter AndersonI love the term ‚Äúenergy vampire‚Äù that Jon uses in his book to refer to the negative people out there who love to suck the life out of you. But you can‚Äôt let them and that‚Äôs why this advice matters hugely.Yes, you can drive your bus with joy and enthusiasm, but at various points passengers will board your bus ‚Äî family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and total strangers ‚Äî and they will want to put up a big old road block and potentially detour your life. But you don‚Äôt have to let them!I realized that when I was feeling the most depressed this past year, it was because I was letting energy vampires affect my usual way of life. Listening to people gossip, complain, whine, spread their ‚Äúwoe-is-me‚Äù attitude or put you down is absolutely poisonous. And yet it‚Äôs so easy to be lured into their antics and to join their energy vampire club (misery sure loves company). But if you let yourself give in to the negativity, it will take control of your life.So, instead of allowing yourself to be tainted by these life suckers, you must drive your bus away. Far away. And when you can‚Äôt completely rid your life of these people, you can find ways to manage them better so as not to let their attitude ruin yours.For me, this meant turning away from social media and the local news, because these sources of ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù are full of negativity and add stress to our lives. And it meant looking in the mirror occasionally and realizing when I was the energy vampire. Luckily, my husband gave me a reality check, because he didn‚Äôt want to listen to my whining and this was a wake up call. So I had to control my own complaints and not allow myself to become an energy vampire to others.So, always spread joy to your passengers, but when that doesn‚Äôt work, drop off the energy vampires and keep on driving toward your goals.‚ÄúChoose to focus your time, energy and conversation around people who inspire you, support you and help you to grow you into your happiest, strongest, wisest self.‚Äù ‚Äî Karen SalmansohnLife happens and following these three pieces of advice is not always easy. But once I remembered that I‚Äôm the driver of my life, I have to choose positivity every day, and I have to avoid the energy vampires, everything turned around for me. I enjoy my work again and outside of work I go on adventures with my husband. I‚Äôm not letting life ‚Äî or people ‚Äî hold me back anymore.What other advice do you have?

Negativity: The Master Time-Thief,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/negativity-the-master-time-thief-b2d87ca3260e,Aaron Blum,86,3,674,"If you had $86,400 in your bank account and lost $10, how much money would you spend to recover the lost money?If you were logical, you would consider the $10 sunk costs and move on because you still got $86,390 left‚Ä¶ not bad, eh?What if I told you that this happened to me once, and I spent over $14,400 to try to find my $10 bill?You would probably think I was crazy. You would probably try to slap some sense into me and tell me to just get over it‚Ä¶ you probably wouldn‚Äôt trust me to handle your money, would you?I think we can all agree that this scenario above is an irrational way to spend money. But it shouldn‚Äôt be all that surprising, because after all, we are not rational beings.Think about how we spend time.In each day there are 86,400 seconds. We can spend hours dwelling on a negative thought or experience that happened in the span of 10 seconds. This negativity eats away at us, robbing us of time ‚Äî our most precious resource.We cling to the bad while the good passes us by unnoticedRecently I received a piece of feedback that led me down the slippery slope of negative thinking. One of my employees left an anonymous comment on a survey to express being overwhelmed from the workload and aggressive metrics. The employee also shared that they felt overlooked, undervalued and didn‚Äôt think there was much room for growth. Ouch. Comments like this always feel like a punch to the gut. I so badly want to provide an amazing work environment for the people on my team. I can‚Äôt help but take it personally. I spent the better part of my weekend dwelling on the feedback. Even though the comment wasn‚Äôt directed at me, the way my brain processed it triggered some familiar insecurities. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI must not be a good leader,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I am doing,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am too young to be managing people.‚ÄùNegative thinking turned my focus inwards. Suddenly I wasn‚Äôt thinking about the employee and the hurt they were experiencing. I was thinking about me and shaming myself in the process. All sense of reality was lost. The feedback was blown out of proportion and I believed that I was the source of the problem and that my whole team was upset with me.Dr. Rick Hanson, a psychologist who writes much on the topic of happiness, describes this reality well:The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences, but Teflon for positive onesIt has been proven by science and experience, we as humans have a bias for negativity.Dr. Hanson reasons that the best way to overcome this bias is to really sit with positive moments and enjoy the experience. Negative thoughts cling to our brain instantaneously, while positive thoughts often take 20‚Äì30 seconds to sink into our consciousness. The more time we give towards being mindful of positive experiences, the more emotionally stimulating it is and the moment becomes solidified as a memory.When I came into the office after the weekend, I looked back at all the feedback I gathered from my team and I realized that in the span of 3 months, I had received only 2 pieces of constructive criticism and countless positive ones. I began reading all the positive comments. I was blown away by the sense of gratefulness and joy that is present within the team. I imagined each member of my team typing the words with a smile on their face. Finally, I felt a sense of release from the one negative comment and regained my grasp on reality. Although not everything was perfect, the team overall was happy, healthy and motivated. I felt proud of the team I got to lead and the positive culture I had the opportunity to be a part of.Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time. ‚Äî Jim RohnYou have 86,400 seconds in this day.Don‚Äôt let negative thinking rob you of another second.",31/05/2019,1,0,1,3,1050,1424,1,0,0,2,212
Online Business Owning Isn‚Äôt a Walk in the Park,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/online-business-owning-isnt-a-walk-in-the-park-ad41e73db125,Gillian Sisley,69000,6,1155,"If you‚Äôre thinking of starting an online business, you‚Äôre probably doing plenty of research to find out exactly what you‚Äôre getting yourself into.And good for you, because a well-informed entrepreneur is a better-equipped entrepreneur!But I‚Äôm going to be real with you. There are some truths that you might have trouble finding online.Truths you‚Äôll need to come to terms with if you‚Äôre going to embark on this journey.These are the reality checks I‚Äôve learned in the three years of being my own boss:You‚Äôve read this already. But you don‚Äôt really know what it means until you‚Äôve done it.For example: the day of the week I clock the most hours? Friday. Always, always Friday.Yup. I work until about 12 AM most Fridays‚Ä¶ and this is the case because:I like to go into the weekend without a worry in the world. I don‚Äôt want to be stressed about a project that‚Äôs not quite finished, or a goal that didn‚Äôt get achieved, for the entire weekend. So I nip it in the bud by getting everything I can done on Friday nights.I easily clock over 12 hours on Fridays. I‚Äôm writing this post to you at 11:13 PM on a Friday night, and I‚Äôm not even close to calling my week quits yet. #glamourJust starting your online business? Barely a penny to your name? Perhaps rubbing two dimes together if you‚Äôre lucky? Sounds like the PERFECT time for the hard drive of your laptop to fry itself like an over-easy egg!This actually happened to me.About a week after I decided to pursue my business full-time (October 2016), my 6-year-old laptop decided to tell me to screw myself, and burned my hard drive to a crisp.I ended up buying a new hard drive to keep my laptop going, because I had a business to run. The charges went straight on my credit card (and stayed there for a while). But it was better than buying a whole new laptop.Of course, when I got it back from the shop, turns out that the WiFi had crapped out as well! So I bought a USB WiFi enhancer.Today, I‚Äôve reached financial comfort in my business. And still that WiFi USB hangs from my computer in its resting dock, 24/7. If it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it! Because that costs money you probably don‚Äôt have!Statistics show that more than 90% of startups fail. Most of the remaining 10% won‚Äôt see any real profit for a year or two.Yup. That‚Äôs a real thing.Now would be the best time to tap into your university-self ‚Äî the days when you spent 4 years so broke-ass poor that you actually laughed about it, because if you cried you‚Äôd basically never stop.Sorry to break it to you, but business is no different.I reached profit FAR sooner than most startups or freelancers. People were surprised, I was shocked‚Ä¶ and it still took me 7 months until I could give myself a real salary. Before then, I transferred funds from my business account to my personal one on a need-to-pay-this-bill basis.Good news ‚Äî if you‚Äôre a new grad, and have yet to make a steady income anyways, this is the perfect time to start your business!You‚Äôre at your prime for pinching pennies for the long haul. That skill will ease a significant amount of the financial pains as you move forward. It was definitely what got me through smiling.I don‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt get your industry. I mean that they may not see it as valid or legitimate starting out. It happens to the best of us. Whether its parents, friends, a partner, you name it.While online businesses aren‚Äôt exactly a new idea (they‚Äôve been steadily popping up for the past 15 years, and have exploded in the past 5), they‚Äôre still not entirely locked down.Baby boomers and older are pretty stumped with this kind of thing. Hell, most of us millennials who are actually doing it are still in awe, confusion and wonder at the premise (what do you mean I can make a full-time income from home, working on my sofa in yoga pants?)Whatever they say, validate yourself in the legitimacy of your business. If you keep up with the hard work, and give your target market exactly what they want, you‚Äôll get to the point where you can prove all those people wrong.News flash: being on top of your health is more imperative than ever.Odds are, you‚Äôre going to start out a one-man/woman show. So, if you get sick and are bed-ridden, guess what happens? Your entire business is at a stand-still. And your clients, more than anyone, are going to suffer for that.But you‚Äôll suffer a bit too. The long working hours are going to be draining. It‚Äôll become challenging to shut your brain off at the end of the day, because you‚Äôve got a million things racing through your mind.The stress and the strain of running your own shit will cause tightness in your neck and shoulders. And you‚Äôll always be at a huge risk for adrenal fatigue, which is the fancy, scientific term for what the entrepreneurship industry knows all too well: burn-out.So what do you do? You don‚Äôt forget to put yourself first‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs easier said than done. Keep in mind that the quality of your health will reflect on the quality of work you‚Äôre putting out there to your clients.But most of all, you‚Äôll just be happier. So suck it up and exercise regularly. Don‚Äôt opt out of lunch to finish something for a client. If you wake up feeling like a train-wreck, go back to sleep. Take the financial hit and book yourself a monthly massage. Or, just take a day in the week off every now and then.Because if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre doing yourself and your business a huge disservice.Most importantly, just listen to your body and respect what it‚Äôs telling you. You‚Äôll find out everything you need from the clues it‚Äôs giving you.While some of my above truths seem less than glamorous, and while it‚Äôs true the Boss Life isn‚Äôt always greener grass, I wouldn‚Äôt be doing anything else.What it comes down to, at the end of the day, is that over all else I value my freedom and flexibility.Few careers will provide the level of freedom or flexibility I have from being my own boss and running my own shit solo. There‚Äôs nothing like it.I‚Äôve without a doubt found the perfect career for me. Through my business, I‚Äôm able to travel to places like Niagara Falls, Arizona and Florida (just to name a few) because I can work from anywhere as long as I have a solid WiFi connection.The income I make from my business means I was able to purchase my first property at 25. My business has allowed me to work with the most inspiring and empowering entrepreneurs Halifax has to offer.I‚Äôm the luckiest LadyBoss in all the land.I sincerely, truly believe that.

The Call for a New Device for Data Scientists,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-call-for-a-new-device-for-data-scientists-c18cf77cf2af,"Richard Charles, Ph.D.",47,10,2121,"Richard Charles, Ph.D. ‚Äî Founder & Chief Data Scientist, Charles Analytics, LLCMy first computer was a Commodore Vic-20 in 1981. I bought the device because of this incredible urge to program in BASIC as a result of Mr. Ted Becker‚Äôs course on computer programming. I vaguely remember the leap from the pain-staking process of programming using punch cards to writing code and watching your program run immediately, once you resolved all of the syntax errors of course. Nonetheless, it was thrilling and addictive! In hindsight, a part of that addiction was a result of being able to code these complex calculations involving products and sums to ridiculously large numbers.Indeed, my first use of a home computer was defined by my vision for the ultimate calculator. I spent hours performing complex calculations that I would never have been able to perform with a calculator. But why was this the case? What choice would I make today if I were presented with a new technology that is so different that it blows away anything that would be considered light years ahead, given all of the current advances in technology? What role did the scientific calculator play in defining how we view the modern computer? Finally, what would be the ideal device for today‚Äôs data analytics professional? The answers to these questions will be the focus of this article.The historical roots of the need for calculating on-the-fly by using a portable device can be traced back to the early origins of mathematics. When early man began the process of trading goods, keeping track of amounts became a vitally important task in order to prevent losses. Early man began using his hands to count small quantities then moved to counting the joints of the entire body as the need for larger numbers arose. The first evidence of shifting to a dedicated device called an abacus can be found in Sumerian culture dating back to around 2,500 BC. These devices used a combination of beads and rods to keep track of much larger numbers. As our lives became more complex and science and mathematics continued to be developed, devices were created to meet that need. In 1916 Napier‚Äôs Bones, the Slide rule (1622), Pascal‚Äôs Calculator (1642), Colmar‚Äôs calculator (1850), Curta Calculator(1942), and the digital calculator (1970), Graphing Calculator (1985) are all examples of major leaps in technology arising from a major shift in newly invented mathematics technology. John Napier‚Äôs development of the logarithm, fundamentally changed how quickly large-scale multiplications and divisions could be performed. Subsequently, the development and impact of the slide rule is well documented as a key component to the U.S. Space program. In particular, the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts all had extensive training in processing rocket propulsion data, performing everyday calculations and calculating trajectories of re-entry and orbit. So prevalent was computation a part of astronaut training in the 60s, NASA decided to make the Picket slide rule a standard issue item for the Apollo program astronauts.There was a tremendous amount of pride associated with owning a device that reflected the complex requirements of the scientific, engineering, mathematical or technological trade of its owner. If the pocket protector and its contents represented the mark of a genius, the slide rule and ultimately, digital calculator, signified the degree to which the genius was skilled at problem solving.When HP developed the digital calculator in 1970, portability became the name of the game. From 1970 to 2008 several versions of the basic calculator include: calculator watches, graphing calculators, scientific calculators and calculators capable of running computer algebra systems (CAS) so that problem solving and deriving solutions or simplified equations can be performed with the push of a button. Most notably, the TI-Nspire CX II, the HP PRIME and the Casio fx-CG500 are all examples of calculators with these features. However, many of these calculator companies are very focused on supporting the educational testing industry in lieu of creating a feature set geared to professionals who have a need to analyze data on the fly. A recent visit to the college board website will allow you to see the list of permitted calculators by manufacturer. The list is long but the list of features for unacceptable calculators is a lot simpler. The graphic below is a screenshot of the details.With the advent of the buttonless, all glass cellphone, the notion of being confined to a device with a single button configuration was liberated. The iPhone changed the game in many ways. In a single device, one could have multiple versions of calculators that could serve differing needs. If you had a need to graph functions, you could download the graphing calculator software of your choice. You are now limited only by the creativity of app developers. Even so, the calculator hardware is not a dedicated solution for computation but merely an adaptation of telephone and mini pc hardware. What if a device was designed from the ground up to meet the computing demands of today‚Äôs analytics professional? What would the hardware and software requirements be?We can safely assume that the requirements that I‚Äôm about to outline would require some major advances in hardware and networking. I‚Äôd like to also establish the premise that data professionals need hardware and software tools that are different from those required by students. Additionally, I propose to anchor our thinking in the notion that a handheld device on its own, may not adequately power the large scale computations required for today‚Äôs professional. Now that we have established our ground rules, I‚Äôd like to identify some of the tasks and roles that today‚Äôs data professionals perform regularly.As a data scientist, the following are tasks and roles that are performed regularly:Mathematical Modeling ‚Äî Modeling is the collection and analysis of data that results in the creation of a mathematical equation that best describes the observed phenomenon. Often times, the modeling process involves the four steps of creating the model, validating the model, evaluating the model and refining the model. Having access to a device that is capable of observing real-world phenomena and constructing mathematical models that describe and capture the phenomena would be extremely valuable. To extend this notion to a device would mean that capturing photos or videos of phenomena would be useful but limited in its implementation. Though image processing for a wide class of images would be valuable, the challenge here would be to narrow the type of observable phenomena. For example, temporal texture recognition can distinguish between trees blowing in the wind and ripples of water in a pond. These phenomena are completely separate from the flow of water through a tube or the rate at which the diameter of a hot air balloon‚Äôs radius changes as it ascends. Another challenge will be to determine the form of the mathematical model. Should it be a graph, equation or description of the phenomena? I would argue, all three representations would provide insight to the relationships that we take for granted.Signal Processing / Time Series Analysis ‚Äî Having the ability to quickly create and analyze time-series on-the-fly would be tremendous and highly valued. A one dimensional time series can easily be generated currently from downloaded stock prices. Determining trends based on stock prices, while detecting false trend predictions due to random walks both visually and analytically would provide an advantage. Certainly, facial recognition technology that would allow one to quickly take a photo and validate it against a database of people, might provide an edge in social situations. We already have apps that allow the combination of a GPS, accelerometer and camera to observe constellations in the night sky. What if we could use a network of devices to observe the moon or a star that was synchronized for similar devices and included a series of world-wide networked, research telescopes as data for enhancing the observation? This may require a more powerful lens on a local device or the leveraging of networked cameras. What if we used such a feature to observe events in real-time? Multiple perspectives of a single story would change how news is covered and analyzed. For example, the audio from a single gunshot could be used on multiple devices to pinpoint the exact location of the source.Machine Learning / Deep Learning ‚Äî Supervised learning (regression, classification), clustering, dimensionality reduction, structured prediction, anomaly detection, artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning all require the ability to extract data from the real world and apply algorithms to determine relationships. In addition, having a device that can quickly identify relationships between variables with the ability to tap into regional, national or world-wide certified databases so that more complex studies may be performed on-the-fly, would be of tremendous value.Statistics & Mathematics ‚Äî The device should have the standard statistical packages that could be found on the most scientific calculators. In addition, more advanced applications tied to statistical packages such as R, Scikit-learn, Mlpy and Statsmodels. These packages will allow for various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, logistic regression random forests, gradient boosting, and Naive Bayes. Access to numerical algorithms through the various libraries supporting C++, Python, Java and R.Creating Data APIs ‚Äî Application Programming Interface (APIs) are critical components when dealing with clients who have a need to access their data analyses via the web or have a need for a new application. Being able to develop API‚Äôs in a robust development environment such as Anaconda, R, SAS or many other data analysis platforms is critical. At the same time, be mindful of any regulations that may govern your APIs. For example, there are strict regulations regarding the handling of financial data that are often overlooked by new practitioners.Data Simulations, Data Cleaning & Warehousing and Data Interrogation ‚Äî Having a device with the capability of handling enormous datasets will require much more RAM than what is available on current portable devices. Running simulations, cleaning, warehousing and querying will require a robust architecture. The device would need to be able to handle the demands of distributed computing implementations of MapReduce such as Hadoop and Spark. As an alternative, graph databases could provide computational efficiencies that could be leveragedOperating SystemThe device will need to be able to run multiple operating systems, depending on the user requirements. A Unix-based operating system would be preferred. Being able to have a multi-boot System would be ideal giving access to iOS, Windows 10 and Unix applications.Hardware RequirementsThe physical device should have an all glass touch-screen with a portion of the device dedicated to having a host of sensors. These sensors should include the option to be modular based on the required application:A mobile network card capable of 100 Mbps upload and 200 Mbps download speeds to address any on-the-fly computations would also be desirable. This would also require a host computer with a graphics card capable of performing Machine Learning algorithms.RAM and StorageThe device should have enough memory to do large scale arrays and have the an Octa-core processor with at least 32GB of RAM with at least 2Tb of storage. Because of the processor demands and the concern for heat, the device need not take the form of a conventional cell phone or thin tablet but can approximate a slightly larger, thicker design.Mobile SoftwareThe choice and performance of software applications will be critical components of our proposed device. A mobile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is robust and reliable is needed. A commitment from and cooperation between developers of Matlab, R Studio, Spyder, MS Visual Studio, SPSS, SAS, MS Excel, Wolfram Alpha, MapReduce implementations and even data visualization applications such as Tableau, will be needed. These applications will require hardware that can manage very large computational tasks while balancing the needs of long battery-life of a mobile device. In addition, MacOS, iOS and Windows 10 need to evolve to address this need for a robust mobile operating system that is geared toward the professional data scientist.There is a need for a new class of device for professionals who want to be able to perform significantly demanding computational tasks on a mobile device. Testing companies have had too much influence on the modern day scientific/graphing calculators. This has led to a limited scope of functionality and a severe lack of innovation in design and applications. Mathematics is a subject that seems to be stuck in traditional computational tasks despite the many technological advances over decades. Its time to make the shift to a device that brings us into a world of new possibilities. What are your thoughts? Would you be interested in such a device? What other hardware and software features can you see as vital to the success of such a device? Let‚Äôs work to make a new type of device a reality.",31/05/2019,0,0,4,11,1050,910,2,1,0,3,31
An Introduction to Python Sets ‚Äî Part III,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-python-sets-part-iii-dbb3e5df2ffc,Chaitanya Baweja,1000,6,889,"‚ÄúA set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.‚Äú ‚Äî George CantorIn the first part, we discussed how to define set objects in Python. We saw that elements in a set are unique and unordered. A set itself can be modified, but the elements contained in a set must be of an immutable type. In the second part, we discovered some of the standard data structure operations like size, adding and deleting elements, modifying a set.In this part, we cover a whole host of set operations that are supported in Python. This includes operations like union, intersection, difference etc.I highly recommend skimming through the previous two stories before starting with this one.As they are unordered, sets in Python can‚Äôt be indexed or sliced. However, Python provides a whole host of operations on set objects that generally mimic the operations that are defined for mathematical sets. Most of these operations can be performed by both operator or method.The main difference between using operators vs methods for set operations is that methods will typically accept any iterable as an argument, but operators require actual sets as operands.Methods will typically accept any iterable as an argument, but operators require actual sets as operands.Before we begin, let‚Äôs define two sets: Color and Fruit.Given two sets, x1 and x2, the union of x1 and x2 is a set consisting of all elements residing in either set.In Python, set union can be performed with the | operator:Set union can also be obtained with the .union() method. The method is invoked on one of the sets, and the other is passed as an argument:Note: Notice that item 'Orange' which appears in both the sets, appears only once in the union. Sets never contain duplicate values.With the | operator, both operands must be sets. But, the .union() method, will take any iterable as an argument. See the gif below for an example.We can similarly evaluate union of multiple sets.Given two sets, x1 and x2, the intersection of x1 and x2 is a set consisting of elements that belong to both the sets.In Python, set intersection can be performed using both the & operator and the .intersection() method.The principal remains the same for operator vs method. & needs sets as arguments while .intersection() can take any iterable as argument but must be invoked on a set.Like earlier, we can specify multiple sets with the intersection method and operator. The resulting set contains only elements that are present in all of the specified sets.Given two sets x1 and x2 , the difference x1-x2 returns the set of all elements that are in x1 but not in x2 .This can be performed in Python by using x1 ‚Äî x2 operator or x1.difference(x2) method.The interesting bit here is when we need to perform this operation on multiple sets. The operation in this case is performed from left to right.When multiple sets are specified, the difference operation is performed from left to right.In the example above, set1 - set2 is computed first, resulting in {'a', 'b', 'f'}. Then, set3 is subtracted from that set, leaving {'a', 'b'} as the result.Given two sets x1 and x2 , the symmetric difference returns the set of all elements that are either in x1 or x2 but not both.This can be performed in Python by using x1 ^ x2 operator or x1.symmetric_difference(x2) method.As with the difference operator, when multiple sets are specified, the operation is performed from left to right.While the ^ operator allows multiple sets, the .symmetric_difference() method doesn‚Äôt.Given two sets x1 and x2 , x1.isdisjoint(x2) returns True if x1 and x2 have no elements in common. Returning True means that x1 & x2 is the empty set.Note: There is no operator for the .isdisjoint() method. Also, isdisjoint() takes only one operand.Given two sets x1 and x2 , x1 is considered to be a subset of x2 if all elements of x1 also belong to x2.Both x1.issubset(x2) and x1 <= x2 return True if x1 is a subset of x2 .Note: A set is considered to be a subset of itself:x1 < x2 determines whether x1 is a proper subset of the x2. Here, the sets can‚Äôt be identical. While a set is considered to be a subset of itself, it is not a proper subset of itself.Similar to subsets, we can check for the reverse of a subset, a superset. In Python, both x1.issuperset(x2) or x1 >= x2 return True if x1 is a superset of x2.In the previous part of this series, we discussed the update method which assigns the union of operands to the set on which the method was invoked. For example:Each of the union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operators listed above has an augmented assignment form that can be used to modify a set.You can find some use cases of the above here.This serves as the final part of An Introduction to Python Sets series. We discussed some important operations that Python provides for set objects. We saw how these operations can be performed by both operator or method. Some of the key takeaways from this story are:Part I of this story is available here.Part II of this story is available here.If you like this story, you might also like my story on List Comprehension in Python and Functions as Objects in Python.",30/05/2019,1,12,19,4,912,644,8,3,0,13,30
7 Concepts From Network Science To Make and Strengthen Key Connections,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/7-concepts-from-network-science-to-make-and-strengthen-key-connections-c36dc7020bd1,David Burkus,1300,6,1315,"Understanding how networks work, how to navigate them, and how to tend to the community they represent is what determines a lot of your career success and a lot of organizations‚Äô ability to perform. Knowing who your friends are and who their friends are, so you can gain a better understanding of the community, will lead to better odds that your network will enhance your success.Fortunately, this insight is backed up by decades of research from the worlds of sociology and network science. Here are seven of the most important concepts to understand from that research.1. Structural HolesAs individuals tend to operate mostly inside of tight-knit communities or clusters, often spaces form between those clusters. Ronald Burt, a sociologist now at the University of Chicago, first theorized about the opportunities inside these gaps in the social structure, or, as he labeled them, ‚Äústructural holes.‚ÄùWhen everyone knows everyone else in the local cluster, the contacts are redundant ‚Äî individual contacts don‚Äôt provide any added benefit from others in the cluster. ‚ÄúPeople who spend a lot of time with the same other people often get to know one another,‚Äù Burt wrote. And when everyone in the local cluster knows or has access to the same information as everyone else, the contacts are likewise redundant. In contrast, ‚Äúa structural hole,‚Äù Burt wrote, ‚Äúis a relationship of non-redundancy between two contacts. The hole is a buffer, like an insulator in an electric circuit.‚ÄùThe gaps between clusters come with a large information advantage, and that those who span the gap are able to leverage that advantage.2. BrokerThis term is closely related to the one above. Indeed, brokers are the people who fill structural holes. ‚ÄúPeople whose networks span structural holes have early access to diverse, often contradictory, information and interpretations, which gives them a competitive advantage in seeing good ideas,‚Äù Burt wrote.Modern studies have shown that brokers who span structural holes between clusters go on to more productive and rewarding careers. In one study, Ronald Burt demonstrated that brokers between groups are often paid more, are promoted more often, and have the best chance of coming up with innovative new ideas.3. Super-ConnectorOne question we often wonder about: Is it better to try to connect with everyone in one industry or profession, or is it better to be the connector between these groups?When we look out at our network and the networks of others, it‚Äôs easy to assume that all our networks are around the same size. Research into human networks, however, reveals that some people have drastically more connections than whatever would be an average ‚Äî they are super-connectors. But the evidence also suggests that most of us have the ability to grow our network large enough to become a super-connector. We just need to grow it carefully. One way to do this is by creating new and valuable connections inside your existing network. If you can do that, you‚Äôre well on your way to becoming a super-connector.4. Preferential attachmentNetworking can sometimes feel like a grind. Will it always be an uphill battle and a constant process to make key connections, or can you grow your network passively?While we might look at people with large-scale networks and marvel at how much work it must take to build and maintain such a large network, the truth is that it gets easier over time. As your network grows, as the number of your connections increases, the process of meeting new people becomes easier. Not because you get more practiced at making introductions, but because introductions are more likely to find you. It‚Äôs a phenomenon that network scientists call preferential attachment, and it explains why the most connected are most likely to stay that way, but also why building your network will take less and less work over time.Preferential attachment influences our decisions more than most of us realize. And that is both bad news and good news. The bad news is that building a network, or building awareness for your new brand, product, or company, is an uphill battle. The good news is that it gets easier over time.5. Illusion of MajorityResearch has revealed an intriguing quirk of social networks: it is possible to appear more popular and connected than you really are. It works a bit like an optical illusion; which is why researchers refer to it as the majority illusion.To understand how the majority illusion works, we first need to revisit a concept we have already covered: super-connectors. Recall that super-connectors are people on the highest point of a power law in terms of connections. The number of people in their network dramatically exceeds the number in the average person‚Äôs network. Most people have a relatively small number of connections, and only a few people (such as super-connectors) have huge numbers of friends. In addition to super-connectors perhaps making you feel like you have a small network compared to theirs, the very existence of super-connectors skews the averages and makes almost everyone feel like they have a smaller network than their peers. The reason is quite simple: their networkis smaller than average. In a network, most people have fewer friends or business contacts than the average.The majority illusion happens because of the vast range of connections between different people in a network. Those with a lower number of connections, observing their more-connected colleagues put forth an idea or trend, conclude that the idea must be more popular than it really is.This can lead them to feel peer pressure (even though it‚Äôs not a majority of their peers), and the idea or trend gets adopted even further. The majority illusion can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.6. HomophilyHere‚Äôs a dire warning for anyone building their network: more isn‚Äôt better if it means more of the same. Put another way, you must resist homophily.Originally coined by Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert Merton in the 1950s, homophily illustrates with data the old anecdote that ‚Äúbirds of a feather flock together.‚Äù In personal relationships, the theory predicts that we are more likely to develop close ties with people who are like us. In social networks, it asserts that networks of individuals will inherently become more segregated and clustered over time. And in study after study, the effect is well documented. Sociologists have seen it wherever they look, from marriages to coworkers to social acquaintances and, yes, even to politics.Homophily turns out to be a puzzling problem. Staying tightly clustered inside a network of similar voices, opinions, and characteristics can truly limit your ability to get an accurate picture of the environment around you and to make the best decisions for yourself or your organization. But that same tightly clustered network also makes it more and more difficult to find the new voices, opinions, and characteristics you need to obtain a more accurate picture. The bottom line is that who you know affects how you think, and it also affects which friend of a friend you‚Äôre likely to meet, for better or worse.7. MultiplexityWhen we consider our overall network, we tend to assign people to certain categories. Some are friends, others are business relationships, and still others are people we interact with because of a shared activity. But networks are often much more complicated than such categories suggest. There is a phenomenon that sociologists call multiplexity ‚Äî that is, two people may have more than one type of relationship. Research reveals that multiplex ties make for a stronger bond between two people, suggesting that, while assigning our contacts to single categories might simplify things, that simplification often comes at a cost of not knowing the full value of our network.Thanks for reading.

Should You Skip the Caffeine?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/should-you-skip-the-caffeine-ef22f95eb4b2,Anna Sofia,33,4,781,"I know, I know. Another article peddling the virtues and vices of caffeine. But for those who believe the motto from the picture, that ‚Äúlife begins after coffee‚Äù (or tea, or an energy drink, or however you choose to get some pep in your step), this four-minute roundup of recent caffeine research should be all the habit-enablement you need ‚Äî with a bit of a reminder at the end, however, to bring your excitement back to earth. You‚Äôre welcome.If you need a singular good reason to remain steady with your caffeine relationship, it may be this: a recent study, published in the journal Psychiatry Research, has found potential links between caffeine intake and reduced symptoms of depression.The data was based on a questionnaire filled out between 2005 and 2006, with the results publicly available to the researchers. They selected over 4,500 responses from the questionnaire ‚Äî anyone who included information on their state of depression and average dietary/caffeine consumption.Once the researchers took outside factors into account, including disease history and sleep disorders, they compared individual depression scores with the amount of total caffeine each participant claimed to consume (including, but not limited to, coffee, tea, and chocolate). They found that those with lower levels of depression tended to indulge in higher levels of caffeine.The study concluded that ‚Äúcaffeine‚Äôs psychostimulant properties appear to protect against depressive symptoms.‚Äù More research needs to be completed around these findings, but it‚Äôs an exciting possibility to consider ‚Äî and may be a good reason to keep drinking that daily cup of caffeine.BMJ, a peer-reviewed journal, published an ‚Äúumbrella review‚Äù of coffee and health in late 2017. In this review, researchers found that increased coffee intakes can lead to a reduced mortality risk, including certain types of cancers. High consumption, which is classified in the article as three to five cups a day, lowered ‚Äúrisk of incident cancer.‚Äù This included melanoma, oral cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer.For smokers, researchers did find ‚Äúconsistent harmful associations‚Äù between drinking coffee and lung cancer. However, when they took existing cancer risks for smokers into account and adjusted accordingly, they found that the association between coffee and lung cancer diminished. What does this mean? A deeper analysis needs to be completed before a proper answer can be given, but it‚Äôs possible that the risk of lung cancer is tied more to the act of smoking than to drinking coffee. It‚Äôs worth noting that researchers did not find the same coffee and lung cancer association in non-smokers.I know you don‚Äôt eat or drink sunscreen, but trust me, this is worth knowing.Research published in Frontiers in Physiology this month found that caffeine mixed with regular sunscreen formula not only avoided skin irritation, it also ‚Äúincreased the photoprotective activity‚Äù of the sunscreen. Basically, the sunscreen that had caffeine added to it contained a ‚Äúhigher SPF value‚Äù than its counterpart.While this research needs to be tested further to see if the same results are achieved, there may be other ways to benefit from caffeine even if you‚Äôre hoping to cut back on drinking it. Perhaps you can start with protecting your skin this summer from UV rays!Not all news is good news, however, and here‚Äôs the safety reminder to bring you down a couple notches before you run to put on another pot of coffee or kettle of tea.According to this study in the journal Nutrients, caffeine in a pure form, like a powder or a tablet, has become a popular way of getting that morning kick. A normal dosage of this is fine ‚Äî similar to drinking a couple cups of coffee ‚Äî but higher doses have been known to cause ‚Äúcaffeine intoxication.‚ÄùThis may sound fun, or at least intriguing, but it‚Äôs not like alcohol intoxication. Caffeine intoxication can cause ‚Äúseizure and cardiac arrhythmias,‚Äù as well as scarier situations like death.Intoxication happens due to how caffeine is absorbed into our body. Soon after we ingest coffee, tea, or energy drinks, caffeine molecules bind to our plasma proteins, raising our overall ‚Äúcaffeine plasma concentration‚Äù levels.A typical cup of coffee translates into a dose between .5 and 2.5 mg, states a study in the Journal of Caffeine and Adenosine Research. The body can easily handle up to 8 mg at a time, but the half-life of this caffeine can last for hours. Pace yourself when consuming caffeine, and avoid doses over 80 mg. These levels, say researchers, are where caffeine can get dangerous, if not lethal.The moral of the story? Enjoy your caffeine; it has some great benefits, and new research is always exciting to break apart. Just be careful when exploring new ways to get that caffeine high ‚Äîbe sure to drink (and ingest) responsibly.",30/05/2019,1,0,0,8,1050,700,1,0,0,7,105

Guaranteed Jobs: How Great is the Need?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/guaranteed-jobs-how-great-is-the-need-b8ee5ec1be3d,Ed Dolan,1500,11,2362,"Part 1 of a two-part series. Follow this link for Part 2.One of the sleeper issues of the election season now getting underway is a federal job guarantee (JG). Such a guarantee would offer public-service employment (PSE) to anyone who wanted it, with government at some level or an approved nonprofit organization as the employer.Guaranteed jobs are far from a new idea. During the Great Depression, the federal government created thousands of jobs through programs like the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps. In his 1944 State of the Union address, President Franklin Roosevelt put the right to a job at a living wage at the very top of his ‚ÄúSecond Bill of Rights.‚ÄùNow the idea is undergoing a revival. Sen. Bernie Sanders has endorsed a full-scale job guarantee. Sen. Cory Booker introduced legislation in the last Congress that called for JG pilot programs in 15 cities. The Green New Deal, introduced in both the Senate and the House with more than 100 co-sponsors, calls explicitly for a job guarantee along with its better-known measures to combat climate change.But why now, when unemployment is at a 50-year low? In reply, JG proponents point to three gaps that persist even in today‚Äôs tight labor market:In this two-part series, I will dig into each part of this three-gap model of the labor market raises more questions than it answers regarding the merits of a federal job guarantee. Part 1, which focuses on the hidden unemployment gap, asks how many people would actually benefit from a job guarantee. Part 2 will look at how the pay gap and public service gap affect the potential costs and benefits of a job guarantee.Two proposalsOur discussion will focus on two of the most fully developed plans for a job guarantee. One is outlined by Mark Paul, William Darity Jr., and Darrick Hamilton (PDH) in a report commissioned by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The other comes from L. Randall Wray, Flavia Dantas, Scott Fullwiler, Pavlina R. Tcherneva, and Stephanie A. Kelton of the Levy Economics Institute.These two proposals have much in common. Both would offer a full- or part-time job to anyone over the age of 16 (Levy Institute) or 18 (PDH) who wants one. The federal government would cover the full cost, but in most cases, it would not be the actual employer.In the PDH plan, most jobs would be with state and local governments, with provisions for direct federal employment as a backup. The Levy Institute plan envisions jobs with state and local governments and with nonprofit organizations. Both proposals specify a generous package of benefits, including health insurance, child care, retirement, and parental leave, among others. Both call for a living wage ‚Äî that is, a wage high enough to ensure that one earner can support a family at an income above the poverty level. Under the PDH plan, the wage would vary with experience and qualifications. In the Levy Institute version, all participants would receive the same wage.The following table gives estimated costs per job for the two plans:Estimating uptake for a JG programThe number of applicants for guaranteed jobs would depend on the size of the hidden unemployment gap ‚Äî the difference between the number of people now working and the number who would take a guaranteed job if it were offered. Here are the Levy Institute‚Äôs estimates, based on data for the third quarter of 2017, at which time the official unemployment rate was 4.1 percent:The total comes to around 12.6 to 17.8 million people, or about 8 to 11 percent of a labor force of 160 million.Using 2018 data, the PDH provides a somewhat lower estimated uptake of 10.7 million people. Most of the difference is attributable to some 3.5 million people who say they want a job but have not looked for work in the previous 12 months, and are thus not classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as ‚Äúmarginally attached to the labor force.‚Äù The Levy Institute counts them as likely candidates for PSE, but PDH does not.In practice, there seems to be little difference between the willingness to work of this group and those who have looked for work in recent months. One analysis of labor market transition data, for instance, notes that people who want a job but have not looked within the past year are almost as likely to find employment in any given month as are those who are officially ‚Äúmarginally attached.‚Äù If both groups are included, there is little difference between the uptake rates expected by the PDH and the Levy Institute.For the sake of discussion, let‚Äôs accept some number in the range of 12 million to 18 million as the number of people likely to apply if guaranteed public-service jobs were offered to all who wanted them. That is not the whole story, however. If we want to evaluate JG as anti-poverty policy, we need to look more carefully at the characteristics of likely applicants, not just at their numbers.Nonemployment and financial stressThere is no question that many people who want to work but can‚Äôt find a job suffer serious financial stress, but that is not true for all of them. Consider, for example, the results of a survey of the nonemployed conducted in 2014 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the New York Times, and CBS News. Here are some key findings of the survey:The nonemployed, nonstressed people in this survey were prime-age adults whose financial needs, in most cases, were presumably being met by the earnings of other members of their households. The survey covered only people of prime working age. It did not include teenage or college-aged people living at home but looking for part-time work while studying. Nor did it include older people who wanted part- or full-time work to supplement an already minimally adequate retirement income, or simply to get out of the house and do something interesting.It is likely, then, that at least some guaranteed jobs would be taken up by people who were motivated by a desire for self-fulfillment or extra pocket money rather than a need to escape poverty. Providing those jobs would increase the cost of a JG program and, at the same time, would dilute its rationale as an antipoverty measure. Additional surveys or results of JG pilot programs might shed light on the number of people in each category. Meanwhile, the reported survey suggests that the issue is far from trivial.The hard-to-employThe long-term unemployed and those who want to work but have given up looking are key target categories for JG policy. By their nature, they include many people who are, for one reason or another, hard to employ.JG advocates recognize that the workers they seek to attract are more likely to have less education and lower skills than the average employed worker. The proposals we are looking at do include at least a modest training component. However, there is more to employability than education and training. The hard-to-employ also include people with criminal records, unstable housing, substance abuse issues, family situations that interfere with regular work schedules, borderline mental and physical conditions that fall short of actual disability, and other problems that make it hard to hold a job.Studies of past and present employment programs show that such people can benefit from work opportunities outside the normal labor market, but they also suggest reasons for caution. Consider, for example, the results of a set of social-enterprise experiments in California, as reported by Mathematica Policy Research. Social enterprises are mission-driven, nonprofit businesses that are specifically established to hire the hard-to-employ. The enterprises that Mathematica studied offer work in service positions similar to those for JG beneficiaries.An important finding of the Mathematica report was that success required extensive support services. Those services included not only job-related training (as recognized by JG advocates), but also general training in job-readiness and personal finance skills; assistance with clothing, transportation, and housing; food pantries; nutritional education; counseling to avoid relapse into drug dependency or criminal behaviors; education regarding public benefits; and tax preparation.Another takeaway is that even with extensive support services, the employment gains of the hard-to-employ, although statistically significant, were quantitatively modest. A year after entering the program, the rate of employment among participants rose from 18 percent to 51 percent; the number in stable housing rose from 15 percent to 53 percent; and the share of income from government fell from 71 percent to 24 percent. To put it concisely, at best half of the participants actually achieved the goal of self-sufficiency.Similar findings emerge from studies of work requirements, which use a stick rather than a carrot to move people from welfare to work. The gold standard for evaluating work requirements is a set of 11 controlled experiments known as the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), which were conducted as part of the welfare reforms of the 1990s. The experiments each lasted five years and were conducted in various cities around the country. Each compared a group of people whose benefits were conditioned on work requirements with a control group who continued to receive welfare as usual.Some of the NEWWS experiments did produce modest gains in employment. Importantly, though, they did so only where they were backed by intensive administrative support, adequate funding, and well-trained staff. Case workers and other administrators had to do more than simply monitor eligibility and compliance. In the most successful experiment (Portland), case workers interacted one-on-one with participants to cajole them into jobs or training programs, or to coerce them to make greater efforts by threatening withdrawal of benefits. Experiments in Oklahoma City and Detroit, where staffing and administrative funding were lower, reported no statistically significant increase in employment.The authors of the PDH and Levy Institute plans recognize that some applicants may have difficulty adjusting to the JG program. However, rather than looking to supportive case work for such employees, they emphasize discharge or discipline. For example, in a reply to critics, L. Randall Wray, a key member of the Levy Institute team, writes:The JG should not devolve to either workfare or welfare ‚Ä¶ Workers can be fired for cause ‚Äî with grievance procedures established to protect their rights, and with conditions on rehiring into the program.Similarly, the PDH report says:For employees to receive their compensation, they must show up to their job and perform the tasks assigned to them. As was the case with the WPA, a Division of Progress Investigation (DPI) should be established to monitor shirking or corruption. If workers are found to be negligent, or generally disruptive to the workplace, disciplinary action can be taken by the DPI.In my view, neither of the JG proposals considered here pay enough attention to the potential challenges posed by the hard-to-employ. Either these plans should budget substantial additional amounts for administrative support and one-on-one case work, or they should cut back their expectations for the number of people that their programs will succeed in moving from poverty to self-sufficiency.Guaranteed jobs vs. nonmarket productionFinally, JG advocates need to give more attention to the fact that many potential applicants are already working, but not in the market economy. Both the PDH and Levy Institute teams point to an increase in GDP as one of the benefits of a JG program. However, to the extent such a program simply replaced nonmarket production with market-based production of similar goods and services, changes in measured GDP would overstate those benefits.Caregiving is one example of a service that is already being produced, but not for pay, by JG candidates. BLS data tell us that many of the people who are out of the labor force but want a job are unavailable for paid employment because they are caregivers for children or other family members. The same is true of many who are working part-time but would prefer full-time jobs.Consider, for example, two parents, in two separate households, who have each been staying home to care for two young children. If a JG program spent $56,000 to hire one of them to work in a community arts program and hired the other as a day care worker to look after all four children, measured GDP would rise by $112,000. However, the only new services produced are those of the arts program. The day care services were already being produced by the parents themselves, but were not counted in GDP, since they were outside the market economy.Additional examples can be found in the vast volunteer sector of the U.S. economy. A BLS report on volunteering found that as of 2015, more than 62 million people aged 16 and older participated in volunteer work. Of those, 5.9 percent devoted more than 500 hours a year to volunteering ‚Äî a huge amount of work.Much of that was spent on exactly the kind of jobs that would be offered by JG programs. In some cases, people who are now out of the labor force and who volunteer as wildlife monitors would happily take paid jobs as JG wildlife monitors. In other cases, people who are already employed but volunteer to pick up trash in the local park on weekends would find they are no longer needed, since a JG worker is already doing the job. Either way, at least part of the work done by JG participants would displace something already being done by volunteers.ConclusionsJG advocates are right when they say that the official unemployment rate, recently at a 50-year low, understates the degree of slack in the labor market. However, an abundance of potential applicants is not enough to conclude that guaranteed public-service employment would be a cost-effective way to move people from poverty to self-sufficiency. To make a convincing case, JG advocates need to pay more attention to three characteristics of the nonemployed and underemployed population they hope to attract:These issues alone are enough to reuire a rethink of the costs and benefits of a full-scale federal job guarantee. In Part 2 of this series, we turn to additional questions about the cost-effectiveness and practicality of guaranteed jobs.Based on a version previously posted by Niskanen Center.

Raised on Nintendo 64: My Story on Bilingualism,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/raised-on-nintendo-64-my-story-of-bilingualism-f1a3c4c0533b,Megan Lou Garc√≠a,10,6,1188,"It‚Äôs Halloween night -1998. I‚Äòm in Kindergarten and my dad forgot to get me a costume. He finishes his shift at Fort Buchanan and goes in search for the skater Barbie costume I wanted. Sold out.Plan B? Dad buys me a Nintendo 64. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying home tonight‚Äù.That was the first console I owned. It was mine and I made sure everyone understood that. I would play Diddy Kong Racing day and night and once I got my hands on Banjo Kazooie and Ocarina of Time, there was no going back. I was invested and my mom -having an only child- was more than happy that I was spending my days in front of the TV instead of outdoors scraping my knees and trying to catch lizards.Now, although most of these games were already challenging enough for a 5 year old to complete successfully, I had other challenges that I shared with fellow islanders and Kindergartners:   1. I couldn‚Äôt read. 2. English wasn‚Äôt my first language ; Spanish was.Sure, there was such a thing as language settings but I didn‚Äôt know that at 5 or 6, I didn‚Äôt figure that out until later in life. At the time, language was simply about survival. Language was about understanding how to actually get the princess back without a walk-through -not an easy task, if I do say so myself.Essentially, that need for understanding and reaching my goals within a game, transformed itself into a language learning experience. As I was forcing myself to develop my ‚Äúgaming abilities‚Äù, I was also puzzling through my characters‚Äô gestures to generate meaning by association language with action.By the time I began 1st grade, not only was I already -slowly but surely- reading, I was doing so in both Spanish and English. I had the best of both worlds because languages expose you to seeing and understanding the world in different ways. They give you a sense of perspective and broaden your opportunities.However, living on an island where our second language is treated as a Foreign Language, this made my public school experience an odd one to say the least. This transformed my second language from being a skill, to being virtue.There was an immense contrast between the other students and I; And for the 7 years that followed, I was the girl that spoke English. It was my alias. You might ask yourself why it was such an important characteristic or even one necessary to point out. But, when you have a group of 30 children and only 1 speaks English, that‚Äôs not only a disadvantage, that‚Äôs proof that there is a big, underlying problem in the system.It wasn‚Äôt until High-school that I stopped being the English speaking kid in the room. I was lucky to find myself surrounded by other people my age who spoke the language, who understood it and were, overall, fluent. Now, here‚Äôs the thing , one factor I had in common with these kids (big surprise here) was: video games and our exposure to them.One thing I didn‚Äôt have in common: they were mostly male.Breaking away from video games- 90‚Äôs television was a prime time for cartoons and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people will agree with me. So, If you were to ask a group of a hundred 20+ year-olds in Puerto Rico where they learned their English, the great majority of them will tell you it was either through Dexter or the Power Puff Girls. These two, breaking away from our after-school routine of Spanish Pok√©mon and Dragon Ball-Z on P√©gate con Chevy. Surely, the answers will most likely allude to television and video games.The problem here is that for all these individuals, English wasn‚Äôt a language they heard in the streets. It wasn‚Äôt something they would be exposed to outside of the confines of a classroom. These kids- us 90‚Äôs Puerto Rican kids in the public school system- grew up taking English for 50 minutes a day and then abandon it all together during the weekends; All except the hermits who played past curfew and would watch cartoon marathons every Saturday. This, again, something more common in males.I‚Äôm sure Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka never intended to empower an entire community of language learners. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not something they aspired to do when they created Zelda. However, this is what they achieved, this is what Nintendo, Cartoon Network and Nickolodeon achieved and today‚Äôs generation has a lot to thank them for.Where are we headed with this new generation?It‚Äôs no surprise that with the evolution of video games in these last 20 years, language diversity in games has also changed for the better. Not only this, but the exposure to English is more present now than ever. Games are no longer about getting from land A to land B. Most game developers are focusing on telling strong and profound stories that engage players through unique and invigorating experiences.Now, as a language teacher myself, I‚Äôve been able to observe a well defined division in the classroom setting. Luckily, in my experience, it no longer comes down to male vs. female students -completely. This division is seen between those who play video games and those who don‚ÄôtAlthough many of the games we played in the 90's have been revamped and redesigned for us nostalgics and these new generations, sights are naturally being directed towards new games. In this case, I want to talk about Fortnite. I‚Äôm sure everyone by now has had an encounter with this game or it‚Äôs quirky dances. Although it has received much backlash from the educational community, claiming that it promotes violence among other things, I have seen -first hand- how the language skills of those I know to play the game at home (boys and girls), are way more proficient than those that don‚Äôt. Their ability for leaning new vocabulary as ESL (English as a Second Language) learner is impressive and it showcases a high contrast with those who are not playing the acclaimed Battle Royale.If we are living, growing and learning in a moment in history where technology is not only a tool but en essential element to our interpersonal, economic, sociological, academic and multi-cultural growth‚Ä¶ then, why not restructure language education to be as such? Why not begin to use gaming as a means of immersion within the language learning process? It is not a difficult goal to accomplish and we have an entire community of gamers that serves as proof of the impact this process has had in their education.I have seen how this phenomenon has impacted my student community. How, although more girls are playing video games today than back in the late 90‚Äôs , there is still a language gap between genders due to more boys asking Santa for a Nintendo Switch for Christmas-and that‚Äôs okay. Yet, it has to change somehow. We have to restructure the way in which we approach language education. Saying that Puerto Rico‚Äôs Department of Education is flawed would be an understatement, but if we have the ability to empower children through gaming, then why not press that ‚ÄúA‚Äù button and take that leap?",30/05/2019,3,0,13,33,732,623,4,0,0,8,37
3 Tips for Sticking to New Habits When Travelling,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/3-tips-for-sticking-to-new-habits-when-travelling-826d22e71b0a,Breathe & Ground | J.K.,86,7,1572,"There is a list of reasons why I love to travel but one of the main reason why I adore to exploring new places and revisiting old, familiar cities is that each time I come out learning something new about myself and my relationship with the external world.Having just arrived in Colorado from a family wedding, the lessons learned this time around are still fresh in my mind. While I have been doing a ton of soul-searching over the past few years, this year I decided to take my commitments up a notch from so-so to serious.I personally have been working on embodying more open-hearted qualities in my life. Anxiety and reactive behavior have been common unwanted companions in my life They have ruined interviews for me, relationships, and the joy of life itself many times. And I have finally reached a point in my life where I feel confident enough in my personal meditation practices and my inner work to take the next step towards releasing these old feelings and patterns for good. So I decided, a few weeks before the wedding, to begin practicing loving-kindness in my meditations.And while I saw some progress in my overall state shortly after my meditation, I noticed the positive effects didn‚Äôt always last as long as I‚Äôd like. I recognized that if I wanted to see a larger shift in my personal life, I would have to become more disciplined in my approach.Before providing any advice on forming a lasting habit, I‚Äôd like to briefly address the concept of self-commitment. Because no new habit will ever last without a deep commitment to the cause.Trust me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs started a diet on a Monday only to have a fellow coworker bring in donuts and bagels (from that good local deli) and then decide to put my diet off for the following week. Or weekend. And so on and so forth until I recognize that it‚Äôs been 4 weeks and nothing has changed.Thus, in order to successfully establish a newfound habit such as a cleaner diet, a meditation practice, or spending less time on social media, you must be willing and driven enough to commit to changing yourself. Half-assing doesn‚Äôt work. Maybe it helped you in college to get by in that class you hated, or that job you somehow found yourself in, but half-assing (or partially dipping in one foot) doesn‚Äôt work when you want to make a change in yourself.Somehow, if even the tiniest part of you isn‚Äôt on board with taking on a new challenge, you will likely stumble a lot more than you‚Äôd like. And stumbling isn‚Äôt something we, as people, enjoy. So we tend to run back to our old selves instead.Your willpower and desires must be greater than your innate resistance in order for real change to occur.So if you want to eat clean that means no special passes for office parties or dates and when you travel that means eating out as well. If you want to meditate daily, for 10 minutes twice a day, then that means not using excuses to find reasons to skip.Incorporating a new habit into your everyday life is hard enough without the additional complications that traveling away from home may entail. Having just experienced this myself with my loving kindness practice I can not only relate but provide some realistic, actionable advice.The difference between a habit and a ritual?The Sacredness.For some reason, I‚Äôve personally held onto this belief that habits are hard but rituals are special and mystical even. Prior to leaving for the family wedding, I had already created a special time and routine that prepped me for entering into my meditation with a calmer and more open heart. The entire routine became labeled as my morning ritual and because of the positive effects that rippled from doing this ritual, it became something I‚Äôd wake up and look forward to each and every day.With this mindset, I approached the trip knowing that in order for me to find some balance with all of the varying plans I would need to adjust and cut down on my ritual. Instead of a 20 min yoga practice, journaling, and a 20 min meditation, I would cut that in half. Having a ritual that I enjoyed doing every single day made it easy for me to see my practice as a sacred space and a necessity- to work on myself and honor my personal development- instead of a habit I needed to check off on a list or app.Prior to taking a trip, consider giving yourself plenty of time to make your habit a ritual in some way shape or form. If you‚Äôre going on a clean diet, consider having a special time in the morning where you brew some decadent tea and create a simple and healthy breakfast just for yourself. Or if you are adding exercise routine consider taking your morning run or time at the gym and switching to walking meditations or trail running without headphones so that you can immerse yourself in the present. If you‚Äôre looking to maintain a deep connection within yourself, as part of a journaling ritual grab a special pen and initiate each entry with a moment of gratitude.As contradictory as this may sound, there are people out there in the world, like me, who benefit from scheduling their free time. Scheduling activities such as going to the gym may be hard when you come home at the end of the day, lay on the couch and then start thinking about dinner. New habits, since they aren‚Äôt hardwired into our minds and bodies, are easy to forget and brush off. And thus, if these activities/habits/rituals are scheduled in, you create less room for ‚Äúnot enough time‚Äù type of excuses. And, if you are able to create a ritual that you enjoy, scheduling time in your calendar will seem like a no brainer.Just set out time in your calendar, create alerts and reminders to keep you on track, and do your best to stick to it. Perhaps try an experimental week, where you schedule in your new ritual at different times to see what works best. Maybe it may end up being at different times every other day. The most important takeaway is that, through committing more deeply to your own growth, you make yourself, and your new practices, a priority. By keeping your new habit at the forefront of your mind, you begin to create the space for new neural connections to form.It can be tempting to want to combine new habits into one- such as attempting a clean diet coming off eating lots of sweets or wanting to meditate 30 minutes a day without any previous training or journaling every day. But this can be a bad idea especially if you plan to travel.I‚Äôm assuming that at minimum, while you‚Äôre traveling, your daily routine will change including waking up in a different bed, the room where you sleep, your surroundings and pace. I know when I travel, if I go by car, I bring my own pillow. If I travel by plane, I choose to risk sleeping on pillows that worsen my neck and back pain. Bad sleep? Then you‚Äôre less likely to do the newly established habit and fall back to your typical routine.Being in a new, or at least different enough from your everyday life, environment means new triggers, distractions, and cravings. It‚Äôs much easier to fall out of step with newly formed rituals because we haven‚Äôt conditioned our bodies and formed memorized behaviors. Whether we like to believe it or not, but the majority of our days we move around the world unconsciously. For example, how else can you drive to the store while texting your mom and drinking that coffee? And do you even consciously recall doing all of those actions at the same time?The answer is that you‚Äôre not consciously driving AND texting AND drinking coffee. You have performed the same behaviors and habits so many times that you‚Äôve subconsciously programmed your body to memorize these actions. So when it comes to implementing that new habit when you‚Äôre away from home and you‚Äôre traveling- don‚Äôt be surprised if you fall back into your unconscious old ways of being.Situations like this are VERY common and are good testing grounds for newly formed rituals, so adding more things to remember onto your already filled up list, is a no-go.Instead, pick one ritual, schedule it, set an alarm, and repeat. If you‚Äôre further along and need some additional support to fully begin to embody your new habit and change, consider adding an intention into your daily practice. Choose a meaningful phrase that fully represents what you want to achieve and reignites the willpower in you to keep applying yourself. During moments of difficulty repeat your intention and allow it to realign you with the positive future of accomplishing your goals.Julia is a freelance writer, health & wellness educator, and mentor.

"Look ma, no hands!",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/look-ma-no-hands-3ddeff7d6e8f,Helen Tsvirinkal,46,7,1316,"Car UX during the transition to autonomy.So, I finally bought a car. I had been waiting for this moment since I first laid my 8 year old hands on the arrow keys of a keyboard to play Need for Speed: Underground from 2003. It‚Äôs not the Acura RSX I‚Äôd been racing all these years, but it still makes my heart race whenever I hear it unlock at the touch of my hand. It comes with a bunch of fancy self-driving features that I was initially too nervous to explore. Then I figured testing these features could be an excellent opportunity to combine my two loves: design thinking and cars üòçNow, technological abilities have skyrocketed in the last few decades but where exactly are we in the process of transitioning to autonomous transportation? We all know self-driving cars aim to minimize ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù, but while we slowly transition, we must better understand what would make them feel more reliable and trustworthy in the first place.It has a lane keeping and road departure sensing feature, a collision mitigation braking system, and adaptive cruise control. Each function is only meant to assist the driver‚Äîit‚Äôs not meant to replace the driver. I find this interesting because my first observation from the assisted-driving experience was its effect on my alertness and stress levels. Even though I knew I still needed to be engaged, the system made it so easy to relax that I couldn‚Äôt help but feel more at ease at the wheel.Without the assistance, my stress fluctuated slightly and appropriately, according to the behaviour on the road I was observing. With the assisted-driving features, I was a lot less stressed on average, but when something unexpected would happen, my stress levels would spike higher than during regular driving. This is partially because I would be in a more relaxed state of mind and less prepared to handle difficult situations, but also partially because I wouldn‚Äôt know how the system would react to the situation on the road.To put it visually (and slightly dramatically), I picture the difference in stress levels like this:Another thing that‚Äôs interesting to note is that after a long period of assisted driving (a few hours), switching back was often a shaky experience ‚Äî it would take me a minute or two to get used to the feeling of having full control of the car again ‚Äî even staying in the lane suddenly felt like a challenge again.After a few months of toying around with the driving system, I started looking into what other people thought of it. I was intrigued to find an article that mentioned Pascal Soboll, the head of Daylight Design Europe, and his first-hand experiences with self-driving cars¬π. He focused on 3 main tips:More specifically, Soboll warns that ‚ÄúUI/UX designers will need to see their job as not just designing for ease of use, but also designing for a learning curve and transition‚Äù.In my opinion, this is the biggest challenge. The transition from manual to autonomous may be very dangerous since it‚Äôs toying with a fine line between convenience and safety. For that convenience, we are willing to trust the car and compromise safety by inadvertently decreasing our alertness, even though it is still required. This is inline with my experience.But let‚Äôs get specific.With the lane keeping system, the car can gently correct its position to stay within the lane. It flashes a message stating that ‚Äústeering is required‚Äù when it senses zero steering input from the driver for about 30 seconds. If your hands are steering and it loses sight of the lane, it does not provide audible or haptic feedback ‚Äî only visually changes the illustration by removing the lanes. In ideal conditions, this is fine because it means the user is steering and paying attention, right? But in reality (and I would argue that this may happen often), the user might just be lightly jiggling the wheel to keep the system engaged. In this case, relying on visual feedback is not optimal.I wanted to see what would happen on a rounded turn (since it shouldn‚Äôt be able to handle a larger turning radius) and of course, the car just lost the lane without any warning. If I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, I would‚Äôve swerved off into the wall. Given the risk levels, I expect the system to offer a proper method of feedback when it releases control of the wheel back to the driver‚Äîsome audible or haptic feedback would be nice.Soboll also talked about ‚Äúsmall steps toward self-driving cars‚Äù which referred to changes in driving experience within the car, but I see this being relevant in the slow evolution of the variety of cars on the road.With the collision mitigation system, the car applies the brakes if it senses that it is not decelerating enough to avoid the car in front of you. In more extreme situations (which I unfortunately encountered once), the braking force is abrupt and jarring. This makes sense since it is applied once the car realizes the driver isn‚Äôt taking action, and luckily it‚Äôs still able to stop in time. BUT, it doesn‚Äôt consider that the car behind you has a human driver with human reaction times! This means that the jarring stop may have stopped you from hitting the car in front, but the person behind you might not react in time and hit you instead.Another unavoidable case is when using the adaptive cruise control feature and having a car cut in front of you. Your car will slow down noticeably until it reaches its goal ‚Äúbuffer distance‚Äù and then it will continue driving at that set distance. Technically its goal is achieved and the task is completed properly ‚Äî as per technical requirements. BUT, consider how unnatural this is in real life.As a human driver, if you‚Äôre cruising at comfortably and someone cuts in front of you, you wouldn‚Äôt slow down drastically just to reset your preferred buffer distance. You‚Äôd probably slow down enough to let them in, and dispense along the lane in a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù way (or decide to change lanes). A car simply can‚Äôt do that right now ‚Äî it cannot fully assess the situation of the environment around you.The last case I want to mention is passing large trucks. The natural, human instinct is to stay a bit further away from the side of a truck, compared to a regular vehicle, since the truck takes up more of its lane. The lane keeping system doesn‚Äôt know this though. Its only goal is to keep you centred within your lane. Obviously this makes sense, but if you want to play it ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and veer a bit away from the truck-side, you‚Äôll have to turn off the lane keeping feature to do so.Overall, this temporarily semi-autonomous vehicle can function with other regular cars on the road, but more care and consideration might need to be made by the designers of these features. Are they fully considering the behaviour of human drivers around this vehicle or are they solely fulfilling engineering requirements? ü§îAll these examples come from my own driving experience, but they serve as anecdotal evidence to the challenge with learning curves and transition to autonomous vehicles. Admittedly, humans can learn to adapt and just like with cruise control nowadays these newer features are excellent when used at the right time, in the right driving circumstances. This ability to learn will slowly help us transition to a fully autonomous future but to get there, self-driving tech still has a long way to go.I think that in the distant future, personal, non-autonomous cars will be a luxury‚Äîjust like horses are now.

How should the ECB normalize monetary policy?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-should-the-ecb-normalize-monetary-policy-2a5f074eb53f,Henri Kouam,112,5,1092,"Synopsis: Following the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its key deposit rate and engaged in large scale asset purchases. Despite the lowering interest rates into negative territory, the recovery is neither speedy, nor inflation converging towards the 2.0% target any faster than expected. The Central Bank should consider raising rates to the zero lower bound, whilst using its targeted long term refinancing operations to achieve its mandate. Its forward guidance should be used to communicate ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù as opposed to the beginning of a tightening cycle ‚Äî preventing an exaggerated market response and continued legitimacy to the Bank‚Äôs policy.The 2008 GFC and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis depressed output in the Euro area (EA), with deflationary pressures not trailing too far behind. As a consequence, the Bank lowered interest rates ‚Äî currently in negative territory at -0.4% ‚Äî and purchased government bonds, commonly referred to as Asset purchases or QE to support output and fight deflation.Both QE and negative interest rates achieved the ECB‚Äôs crisis-limiting goalThe impact has been much more tempered than both the ECB and market participants would have liked. The economy has grown, however tepidly, accelerating to 2.4% in 2017, partly explained by the synchronized cyclical upswing. Inflation, meanwhile, only reached 1.7% in May 2019, driven in part by higher oil prices and a slightly weaker Euro. Some might deride APP as ineffective, but ultra-accommodative is a crisis-centric tool designed to prevent a pronounced correction in asset prices or assuage the impact of an economic downturn on macroeconomic aggregates such as employment, GDP, inflation. Even as some justifiable decry the distributional effects of QE as uneven, it has limited the effects of the financial fallout, returned some inflation and protected household home values. I discuss the distributional impacts of QE here.The Benefits of negative interest are marginal at bestAdmittedly, negative interest rates are a powerful signaling tool for future monetary policy. Together with low and stable inflation the lower term premium affects mortgage rates, asset prices, growth, and support the attainment of the Central Bank‚Äôs mandate i.e price stability. It is, however, to ascribe a lower term premium to QE as low and stable inflation and legitimacy of the inflation target explain the falling trend seen before the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike the U.S., the EZ experienced a financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis. As such, the most dramatic moment starring Mario Draghi ‚Äú The ECB is willing to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro‚Äù was not only justified but necessary to guide market expectations and shore up confidence in the inflation target and the ECB‚Äôs ability to achieve it. The purchase of the public sector and corporate debt ‚Äî see graph below ‚Äî enhanced the signal of ECB forward guidance and contributed, rather than depress the term premium significantly.This returned a sense of calm to the markets and increased confidence in the inflation target and deflationary averse policy. Nevertheless, paper from the Norges Bank, which matches Swedish Bank-level data finds that a policy rate of -0.5% increases borrowing by 15 bps whilst reducing output by 7bps ‚Äî as the overall effects of Bank profits can be contractionary; hence offsetting any lending-derived gains in the real economy. All these, are unsurprising as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy breaks down when interest rates turn negative. As such, negative interest rates are net neutral at best and restrains or slows the economy at worst.10 Years after the 2008 GFCThe last ten years have seen an amount of unprecedented monetary stimulus injected into the economy. In spite of the distributional effects being uneven, the economy is slowly growing and inflation is finally rising even as a tighter labor market and rising unit labor cost has done little to push core inflation towards the 2.0% target. The relationship between falling unemployment and higher inflation persist, but the intensity has come under increasing strain. As we question the legitimacy of the Philips curve, we must recalibrate expectations as unconventional monetary policy steers the economy through unchartered waters. Furthermore, inflation is unlikely to rise substantially is at all businesses pass on the cost to consumers.Why is inflation still low?Several authors argue that previous drivers of inflation have become increasingly exogenous and the online market place has placed permanent downward pressures on inflation outcome. Another plausible explanation is that the current slack in the EZ economy might be much lower than previously expected. Even if this weren‚Äôt the case, sub-par inflation suggests some distortion in previously responsive transmission mechanisms.One thing remains certain; if the current monetary policy or its delivery isn‚Äôt the issue, policymakers need a rethink of the ECB‚Äôs inflation target or current mandate. This is increasingly true as ultraloose monetary policy, a tighter labor market, higher oil prices, and unit labor costs have not fed through to underlying inflationary pressures. A postcrisis rethink will not only stave off policy mistakes, which could be the coal in the canary for the Euro; it will allow a novel policy mix to emerge. One that balances the need for policy space against the ECB‚Äôs target of low and stable inflation.How should the ECB normalize?Before answering this question, it is important to note that the point of economic theory is to serve as a guide for practice, not constrain it. As such, the ECB could raise the deposit rate by 15 bps to -0.25, which is nonetheless 50bps lower than the marginal lending facility. Meanwhile, targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) can support household and business lending and negate any sentiment-driven economic shock.Some will understandably argue that raising interest rates will wrongly signal the beginning of a tightening cycle; this need not be the case as the deposit rate will remain well below negative territory and the real economy will continue to grow at a gradual pace, buttressed by continued lending to the real economy. The Central Bank should utilize forward guidance to communicate the October hike as transient and stipulate this is not the beginning of a tightening cycle. However, moving away from the zero lower bounds will provide some room for the next crisis.Market ImplicationsThe Euro will only appreciate marginally as the interest rate differential with other major economies such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the U.S. persists. Meanwhile, dismal bank profits will likely recover as reliance on trading revenues is lessened, providing further winds in the sails of the recovery. Admittedly, the slightly firmer Euro is unlikely to affect exports as the interest rate differential with the dollar and GBP remain fairly wide",31/05/2019,0,0,7,9,1050,627,2,0,0,1,1

Brands are Artifacts of Culture,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/brands-are-artifacts-of-culture-7bd101377990,J√§n Paul Ostendorf,129,5,1193,"To understand how a brand can be a cultural artifact, we‚Äôll look at an easy to translate example. The basis of a nonprofit organization is the belief for social good. They directly stem from beliefs of individuals, groups, or organizations. Charity Water is one such nonprofit that is like so many others, yet so different. It started with Scott Harrison‚Äôs belief that everyone should have access to clean drinking water. Seven years later, 1.3 million more people in the third world have sustainable, safe drinking water. He and his wife have been able to create a charity brand (or cultural artifact) that‚Äôs nothing short of revolutionary. It all started with the belief that everyone in the world should have access to clean drinking water. That idea became a value others could identify with or adopt as their own which initiated an action or behavior. An organization (brand or artifact) was created to embody, direct and channel this new behavior taken by its supporters.Edgar Schein‚Äôs organizational culture model states that there are three distinct levels in culture:CULTURAL MODELThird level: Artifacts and Behaviors Second level: Espoused Values First and base level: Assumptions or beliefsCULTURE MODEL with BRAND OVERLAYArtifact Level: Charity WaterValues Level: Providing clean water to the world Beliefs Level: Everyone should have clean waterEvery great brand was first an idea by one person. It‚Äôs amazing to think that an idea could turn into a world-changing brand and affect millions of people‚Äôs lives. If you think of names like the Red Cross, RED, The United Way and now Charity Water, unlike governments and other institutions, they have been able to cross borders and grow from country to country with relative ease. Some brands can cross borders that governments can‚Äôt. In some situations, they have more power to do good. Obviously these don‚Äôt need to be charity brands. Now with TOMS Shoes and Paul Newman‚Äôs brand you have hybrid charity/profit brands that are affecting culture. They all started with a thought from the founder at some point.It‚Äôs also easier to apply this concept to startups rather than older, more mature businesses, organizations, and corporations. But like charities, I believe it‚Äôs important to tap into the belief system that started the effort to uncover the purpose for the organization. That‚Äôs why I have the CEO write belief statements. I want to hear what motivated them to start the company or what motivated them to become the CEO. I imagine the CEO didn‚Äôt jump at the first offer and that they were more strategic about what companies they wanted to spend their time and energy with. All those decision-making thoughts and beliefs about why they are the CEO are important to uncover.There are other reasons as well; writing belief statements make people break away from the marketing buzz words and typical business speak. It keeps people from using industry terms and acronyms that carry no meaning to those outside the industry. It also promotes more emotional language that motivates. It makes people think what they believe is really necessary about the existence of their company ‚Äî why would anyone want to be a part of it?Here are some questions you can ask yourself when accomplishing this task of writing your belief statements. What are your belief statements that motivate you to provide your products or services? What do you believe the world needs and deserves? (And if your company doesn‚Äôt provide it, no one will.) Act like you‚Äôre starting a movement, not a company. Envision yourself at a crowded street corner with 30 minutes to fill a bus full of people to start your company from scratch. Start the belief statement with ‚ÄúI believe everyone should have the opportunity to‚Ä¶‚Äù As an example, we could guess what Apple‚Äôs might be, ‚ÄúWe believe in doing things differently. We believe products can be both gorgeous and fun to use.‚ÄùCore values are ‚Äúthe how‚Äù or ‚Äúthe way‚Äù you will accomplish your ‚Äúwhy.‚ÄùAfter all the statements have been written, you may find that your purpose is still not jumping out at you. You may also find that most of these sound like core values. You would be right. When trying to discover your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you will find many people start by writing down their core values. Core values are ‚Äúthe how‚Äù you accomplish your ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Some typical core values that may get used as a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: integrity, quality, transparency, dedication, responsibility, humility, honesty, etc. If your purpose was ‚ÄúI love to build things‚Äù you could add the core value in as ‚Äúhow‚Äù you build. For example, you could write, ‚ÄúWe build with transparency‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe are dedicated to building quality.‚Äù It starts to sound like a mission statement. To extend this example out:Who You Are: A builderYour Why: Building for LifeYour Vision: Build homes that will last generationsYour Mission: Building homes with transparency in collaboration with our customers. We keep our clients involved in every step: choosing quality materials, customizing floor plans tailored to their lifestyle and only excepting payment for the phases we‚Äôve finished to their liking.My personal preference is to weave your core values into the copy of your marketing materials rather than have a page dedicated to listing them. I believe it‚Äôs more powerful to include your core values in your everyday language. A list looks like you had an assignment to write them and you‚Äôre providing proof you did your homework ‚Äî a task to cross off your list. Making them a part of the corporate vocabulary from your headlines and positioning statement to your body copy is the best way to embody your purpose. It creates a personality and character for the company that‚Äôs weaved into its fabric.I read about an interview with Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh, where the interviewer was shocked that no publicist or media relations person came to meet them at the front door. The transparency went further. There was nowhere in the company the interviewer couldn‚Äôt go or person they couldn‚Äôt interview. Zappos core values are so entrenched that Tony had 100% confidence that anyone would represent them with their own words.The Zappos core values were developed over email by everyone in the company. It took a year to compile, distill and rewrite them into what they are now. Tony started the process by emailing everyone in the company to provide what they believed were their core values. He distilled them into categories and rewrote them to encompass the complete message. Zappos believes in them so wholeheartedly that they will fire people if they don‚Äôt live them ‚Äî even if they are having outstanding job performance in all other areas. SpaceX is the same way. Elon has been quoted saying, ‚ÄúWe have a strict no asshole policy.‚ÄùWriting belief statements can be a profitable exercise to uncover what the employees and CEOs believe are important. These beliefs translate into ‚Äúhow‚Äù they conduct their lives and their businesses. The statements can give a peek inside the minds of business leaders allowing their purpose, drive and motivation to be uncovered. This personal internal motivation will show itself in why they started the company or why they work for this particular company as opposed to any other.",30/05/2019,0,0,10,0,1050,501,1,0,0,0,7
Zero Resistance Creativity,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/zero-resistance-creativity-eff98f16fa65,Kevin C. Kuo,69,6,1108,"This is a term I started using recently to describe my creative philosophy. I used to think about creativity in terms of flow, and while I still like this concept I find it‚Äôs a bit inaccessible for some. Zero Resistance Creativity is my attempt to find a happy medium. It‚Äôs a creative process that I believe anyone can adopt and make work for their unique sensibilities and situation.Over 130 days ago, I started a daily challenge to work on a fantasy book project that I‚Äôve been thinking about for years. I got a few pages here and there, but I never went deeper with it. Finally, I decided I needed to bite the bullet and start working in earnest. So far, I‚Äôve written over 290,000 words and have averaged over 2,000 words a day throughout this period. If you‚Äôre interested in reading more on this challenge, I detail the lessons I‚Äôve learned from this process here.During this time I also started teaching myself guitar, began learning how to compose music and picked up pixel art. All of these skills were developed in order to enable my wife and I to develop our first game together. It was through this intense period of creative productivity that I stumbled upon the idea behind my current creative process and philosophy.My goal with this post is to describe the purpose, vision and goal of Zero Resistance Creativity. It‚Äôs become my creative ethos and has supercharged my creative energy, made me happier, healthier and more productive. I hope you can glean something from it that will help you on your own creative journey!Zero Resistance Creativity believes that creativity is an infinite resource that everyone possesses. It cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be amplified or diminished. Peak creativity tends to feel like ‚Äúflow‚Äù, an experience in which all sense and awareness of time disappears. However, I find that talking about peak creativity sometimes leads others to feel discouraged or disconnected if it isn‚Äôt an experience that they‚Äôve had or had often. Zero Resistance Creativity doesn‚Äôt require to be in a flow state. And it‚Äôs really simple.There‚Äôs only one rule: Avoid Resistance.Only work on the creative projects that you most want to invest in. If you have multiple projects and creative pursuits, choose 1 or 2 that most excite you and focus on those. The litmus test of Zero Resistance Creativity is procrastination. If you sit down to work and can‚Äôt get started, then move onto a different project.Then your challenge is to find a creative pursuit that does.It‚Äôs likely that your desire is not strong enough for whatever it is you think you want to do. I used to think that procrastination and discipline were the reasons why I couldn‚Äôt sustain the creative bursts of energy I would experience from time to time. What I now realize is that my previous creative pursuits were set up for failure because there was too much resistance.For example, I spent a good chunk of my 20s working as a film maker. I would say I actively disliked (even hated) about 75% of the work. Independent filmmaking is a lot of people wrangling, asking for favors, money, resources and a whole host of other production challenges that I don‚Äôt enjoy. The best part about filmmaking for me was writing and directing, but even this was limited because of time and money.I started out interested in creative writing, but switched to filmmaking because I kept hearing that people don‚Äôt read. This decision was rooted in a scarcity mindset. I think of scarcity as another form of internal resistance. It‚Äôs very hard to sustain creativity energy when there‚Äôs high levels of internal resistance.If this is true for whatever it is that you‚Äôre currently pursuing, stop now and reconsider your desires. Do you really want to do this? Many people say they want to write, but hate writing. If you think about this more deeply, it really doesn‚Äôt make much sense.When I‚Äôm doing something that involves zero resistance, I can summon immense discipline and focus. But when I‚Äôm not, suddenly I‚Äôm checking social media, the stock market and my e-mail every three minutes. My bet is that this is true for most of us. There‚Äôs a place for discipline and persistence in our creative endeavors, but these efforts are best suited for work that involves little to no resistance to begin with.If you‚Äôre doing something you deeply desire to do, all that discipline and persistence will only enhance your creative output. It‚Äôll be the equivalent of turning your garden hose on max and watching a torrent of water burst out of the nozzle.We like to talk about the great success stories across all fields and disciplines. We like to tout the achievements of the business people, artists and athletes that we deeply admire. But for some reason, we focus mostly on their ‚Äòsuccessful habits‚Äô when talking about the reasons behind their success. But behind every story of persistence and deliberate and consistent effort, is an even greater story of powerful, life-changing desire.Powerful desire cannot be quenched, stymied or blocked. It is a deluge, an avalanche and a tornado all in one. If you have it, you know it.What are your creative desires? Are they strong enough? If you‚Äôre suffering from discipline, lack of focus and procrastination issues, chances are your desires are too weak. Stop focusing on being successful and modeling other successful people and dig deeper within yourself. Tap into your own innate desires. It may take serious time and effort to get past all the gunk that has blocked your creativity, but I assure you it‚Äôs there.Oh, you‚Äôll know. You will end your days feeling alive, productive and looking forward to tomorrow. You‚Äôll stop searching online for articles on ‚Äúhow to be more productive‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to get started and stay motivated.‚Äù Your physical and mental health will improve, sex will be more abundant and enjoyable (totally serious), and your social connections will be richer and deeper.If you think about it logically, resistance kills the flow of energy. Energy is the source of all life. If you want to tap into the deep wells of life that are available to all, focus on avoiding resistance.Zero Resistance Creativity is all about inhabiting the present moment. You can still have short and long term goals, but ideally they float in the back of your mind. When you sit down to write, compose music or draw and you‚Äôre approaching it with a mindset of Zero Resistance Creativity, flow will happen naturally.If it‚Äôs not, then move onto something else until creativity starts flowing.Originally published at https://kevinchesterkuo.com on May 30, 2019.",30/05/2019,0,0,11,4,762,1193,2,1,0,4,70
How to be Terrible at Everything,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/https-medium-com-blakekbailey-how-to-be-terrible-at-everything-36e0bb2f1277,Blake Bailey,10,5,1009,"The painful yet rewarding life of a generalist in a specialist‚Äôs world.Growing up, I was always told to find my passion. A singular pursuit that would be my one career for the rest of my life. Do what you love and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life they said. But what if you love to do a little bit of everything? Well then, you might just be a generalist.Most people are specialists, as in, they specialize in one specific field for their entire lives. They amass a considerable amount of knowledge in one field, and then they die. There is 100% nothing wrong with this, like at all. Doing what you love might very well be one specific thing, and that‚Äôs fine, but not for me.I find that I will get obsessed about something, garner a medium deep level of knowledge in it, and then get bored and move on to the next thing.Whereas most people have very deep knowledge in one or maybe two very specific things, I have a medium level of knowledge in a wide array of things.If you put a generalist up against a specialist in any one area, the specialists will always win. But, generalists can play in more arenas and see the connections between those arenas that specialists aren‚Äôt privy to.It also means that generalists can manage a team of people much smarter than them (in their respective areas), have an intellectual conversation about their work, but leave the specialists to dive deeper into the details.Finding the hidden connections and underlying relationships between disparate ideas is where generalists excel. It‚Äôs why generalists tend to be entrepreneurs and innovators.There‚Äôs definitely a cost though. For one, employers do not want generalists. They want someone who can fill their one specific need better than anyone else. It makes total sense, why pay someone who isn‚Äôt the very best at the one specific role?Start-ups are the exception here. Since startups don‚Äôt have the capital at hand to pay a bunch of specialists, the first employees (and founders) are always generalists.These are people who can ‚Äòwear multiple hats‚Äô, and effectively do many things well enough to get the job done. Specialists tend to hate start-ups and need a more rigid and defined structure to succeed.On another hand, while generalists do tend to be entrepreneurs and innovators, it‚Äôs only if they can actually push themselves to do those things.Often, people with a wide array of abilities will waste them by not applying them. Sometimes this is due to the difficulties in finding work, or just the overall exhaustion of balancing so many interests in a world built for specialists.All through school, you are told that at best you can become a Doctor or a Lawyer. The entire purpose of school is to show you a ton of different disciplines and guide you in choosing only one to do forever.For me, this meant that I continuously evolved and shifted my path towards different careers. I‚Äôve gone from neuroscience (three different versions of this I might add) to non-profits, to tech, and finally to a weird mesh of business, technology, and psychology.Trying to fit the ‚Äòone-career‚Äô stigma meant that these shifts were extremely stressful, full of self-doubt and personal judgment. Why couldn‚Äôt I just be happy with one thing?Because I was never supposed to.A couple of weeks ago, I was deep in my self-doubt. After many years, I was on the brink of making the decision of stepping away from my start-up. Though I still believed in the mission and need, I knew that I had lost my passion for it.Immediately, my brain jumped into the question of what next? If this company wasn‚Äôt my big calling, then what is? Per usual, I was overthinking things.On this day, I just so happened to be walking around Old Town Alexandria and stumbled into a favorite spot of mine, the Torpedo Factory Art Center. For some context, it was a WW2 torpedo and munitions factory that was later repurposed into about 100 art studios, it‚Äôs pretty awesome.In my mopey state, I happened to walk by the studio of Matthew Johnston. This painting immediately caught my attention and drew me inside:For me, it looked like different layers of the cortex interconnected and stained. This was something harkened back to my days of neuroscience research.As I stood in his studio, I noticed that he had an extremely wide array of different pieces. Compared to every other artist, whose pieces all trended towards a congruent style, it begged the question, how did he make these transitions? So I asked him.He said that the transitions were not immediate and that over his career he has gradually moved from one interest to the next, following his passions. It wasn‚Äôt a negative experience, but a positive one, constantly evolving with his interests.The concept was new to me, and it immediately hit home. Here I was, trying to force myself into one thing, searching for the one grand destination. Along the way though, I lost sight of what actually drives me, the journey. Maybe my purpose in life wasn‚Äôt to do one thing but to do many.Consider that Da Vinci, one of the greatest polymaths in history, was a painter, scientist, engineer, writer, botanist, anatomist, musician and more. If someone had forced him into one thing for his entire life, we would likely have been deprived of his inventions or the Mona Lisa.Coming to terms with your natural way of thinking is equally important and difficult. Our society favors specialists because they play a role and fit in nicely. Because of this, everything around us is pushing in this direction.If you‚Äôre one of these people, and you just don‚Äôt feel like you belong or haven‚Äôt found your calling, you might just be a generalist. The sooner you come to this realization, the sooner you can start to benefit from it.Take your unique combination of experiences and make it work for you. You might just be the next Da Vinci, so don‚Äôt overthink it and just make it happen.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,1,743,593,6,0,0,8,43

Why a Style Guide Is Just Good Business,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-a-style-guide-is-just-good-business-da8058235f17,Ellen Barber,50,3,612,"Does your company or department have a style guide? It can be as simple as a list of terms or as substantial as a book, but a good style guide can improve your organization‚Äôs efficiency, enhance its image, and even increase its profits.Consistency in a company‚Äôs written materials is part of its branding.A style manual, or style guide, describes the rules an organization has decided to follow in preparing its documents. Whether written for employees, clients, or the public, a company‚Äôs documentation is part of its identity. That‚Äôs one reason Apple has a style guide. Consistency in a company‚Äôs written materials is part of its branding.A style guide may tell you which terms to capitalize, which acronyms to spell out, and whether to use the so-called serial (or ‚ÄúOxford‚Äù) comma. It may specify the proper names of particular products, services, or programs. It may describe the correct use of any trademarks the company owns. Pepsi, for example, has a guide that specifically addresses the brand‚Äôs visual identity and includes specific guidelines ‚Äî colors, fonts, sizes ‚Äî for different versions of its logo.If you hire contract writers or designers, a style guide reduces the revisions and back-and-forth time that can greatly increase the cost of a project.A style guide can increase the efficiency of employees and management alike. If your company regularly lowercases the word ‚Äúinternet‚Äù or hyphenates ‚Äúback-test,‚Äù your style guide will include those items, so the same decisions don‚Äôt have to be made over and over. When you hire a new employee, training time is cut down when, in addition to your policies and procedures manual, you can give that employee a documented set of guidelines to use for all written communications.And if you work with contract writers or graphic designers, being able to provide a copy of your organization‚Äôs style guide cuts down on questions and revisions, reducing the back-and-forth time that can increase the cost of a project.Consistency conveys the kind of attention to detail that is associated with true professionals.Clear, consistent writing contributes to the image of a competent organization. If your company sometimes works with ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù and other times with ‚Äúadvisors,‚Äù you risk appearing unprofessional or careless. (According to Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Collegiate Dictionary, neither spelling is incorrect; use one or the other, but be consistent.) Consistency conveys the kind of attention to detail that is associated with true professionals.The CIA‚Äôs style manual (full text available here) explicitly states that the agency‚Äôs successful operation depends ‚Äúin large measure on clear, concise writing.‚Äù In addition, when written materials have to be prepared by a group of individuals, a style guide can help that team achieve a uniform tone.Every industry has its own terminology, so organizations commonly supplement or replace the existing published manuals with their own in-house style guides.An organization may adopt one of the widely available published style manuals, and different fields tend to use particular guides. In the U.S., most newspapers follow the Associated Press Stylebook. Trade and university book publishers tend to use the Chicago Manual of Style (available both as a printed book and by online subscription).

Why Funded Startups Should Always be Innovating,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-funded-startups-should-always-be-innovating-d4ed754f9018,Imaginovation,105,5,938,"Innovation, Disruption, and Startups are in synonymous with each other. When we talk about startups, we naturally start thinking about innovative products, disruptive technologies, and smart devices.Startups are places where innovation takes place. With the introduction of emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and Blockchain, turning innovative ideas into reality has become much easier.When you‚Äôre a team of 1 to 5 dedicated people, your startup is pretty much agile. You develop innovative products, test, and iterate until it becomes perfect for the launch.However, as the startup grows, it starts loosing on its innovation side. When the startup receives round one or two of funding, the innovation phase starts to fade out. Now, you got to focus on increasing the team size, scale up the production, and work on to increase ROI. That‚Äôs where things start to fall apart.Of course, funding is essential to scale up your business. However, to keep up with the expectations of the investors, startups focus too much on generating profits rather than innovation.It is commonly noticed that 99% of startups fail within just two years of their conception. And, not being innovative is one of the primary reasons for the failure.In the last year, 100 million new businesses were launched across the globe. When there‚Äôs a massive competition like this, you have to keep innovating to survive.According to the reports:From the above numbers, it‚Äôs quite clear that your startup should always be creative to stay ahead of the competition and generate new streams of revenue.For every startup or small business, innovation and creative thinking should be part of the company‚Äôs DNA. Constant innovation increases the chances of business growth. It also helps you build efficient processes that lead to better productivity and performance.Startups should keep generating and adopting new ideas to take advantage of the competitive edge.Here‚Äôs how constant innovation can benefit startups and small businesses:Continuous innovation gives funded startups a competitive edge and helps them always stay at the top. There are numerous examples of companies that quickly grabbed the market and became leaders with the help of disruptive innovation, but failed to stay on top.The main reason why these companies failed to retain their position is that they couldn‚Äôt keep up with the pace of innovation. Apple Inc. is the biggest example of this. Despite fierce competition, Apple remained an industry leader since its launch. However, today, the company is experiencing a decline in revenue due to a lack of innovation.On the other hand, companies like Uber and Amazon have successfully managed to remain industry leaders. Right from the robust app to ridesharing facilities and premium cars, Uber is continuously innovating its products and services.Despite being the most prominent e-commerce platform, Amazon is investing in building innovative cloud platforms and smart homes.Constant innovation not only helps you remain industry leaders but also enables you to unlock several new opportunities for business.Many times startups and small businesses get stuck into problems that don‚Äôt seem to go away. It requires out of the box thinking and creative solutions to solve particular problem areas in your business.Startups that promote innovation and creativity can easily find solutions for hard-to-solve problems. As everyone in the team is focussed on improving the end product, it boosts the overall productivity and offers a huge benefit to your business.Take, for example, Google. In each of their offices, Google has assigned a special day dedicated to experimentation and innovation. The Internet giant encourages employees to innovate and has an in-house incubation system to promote excellent ideas. Innovative products like Maps, Hangouts, etc. are all born out of their in-house team.Being always creative can surely take you to the top of the market and help you remain the market leader. However, remember, one good idea adds thousands of new followers. Your competitors can follow your plan and create tough competition for your business.So, if you want to remain a market leader, you need always to keep thinking about the next step or the next innovation. This way you can stay far ahead of your competition.Innovative products or services help your business stand out from the crowd. It would help if you had creative ideas to always stay on top of the minds of your customers.You can transform your existing products or services with innovations or develop a new business stream altogether. With innovation being at the center point of your business and marketing strategy, you can easily stand out and attract new customers.When your competition is with some of the big players in the industry, then innovation is the only ideal way to sustain. Big brands have the necessary resources at their disposal, and they can quickly adapt to new technologies. Enterprise-level businesses have easy access to bigger platforms.To get a strong foothold against big companies, you need to nurture innovation and creativity in your startup.Well, innovation should be at the core of your startup. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean every funded startup out there has to be an R&D powerhouse. Google invested in innovative products long after it got a strong foothold. Facebook made React when it became a social networking giant.It‚Äôs ok NOT to be an innovation lab. If you‚Äôre an early stage startup and have innovative ideas, you can always outsource the work to get the job done for you.You can hire industry experts, like Imaginovation, to turn your innovative ideas into reality, so you can entirely focus on growing your funded startup.We at Imaginovation help funded startups to shape their ideas and come up with the best possible solutions.

4 Lessons on Motivation from the Greek Hero Odysseus,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/4-lessons-on-motivation-from-the-greek-hero-odysseus-2348d536571e,Davide Migali,101,5,966,"We need to change. We want to change. But we don‚Äôt change.We all have results we would like to achieve or unhealthy habits we would like to stop. Most of us, at the beginning of a transformational journey, display an authentic and sincere commitment to our goals. Yet very few are able to actually reach them and, more importantly, to maintain those achievements over time.One critical difference separates those who fail from those who succeed. While failure is often blamed on a lack of willpower, it is actually the ability to recognize that willpower alone is not enough ‚Äî and to plan accordingly ‚Äî that marks out the successful.Designed to fail‚ÄúGiving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I‚Äôve done it thousands of times‚Äù ‚Äî Mark Twain.Humans, for biological and evolutionary reasons, are easily engaged in addictive behaviors and, by the same token, they also struggle to escape them.Many think the key to regaining our freedom is willpower. They believe that the deep and burning desire of doing something is the gateway to a better version of ourselves.Conversely, failing to reach our desired goal appears to be proof of our inability to deploy a sufficient degree of self-motivation. We tell ourselves that we failed because in the end, either we didn‚Äôt really want it or, worse, because we are weak and powerless creatures.We beat ourselves up because we have realized that we are not masters, but slaves of our emotions and biological impulses.Before we start complaining about the misery of the human condition, it is worth remembering a Greek king, a mythical hero and a man of formidable intellect and wisdom: Odysseus.His fictional character is often used to represent the superiority of intelligence and cunning pragmatism over brute force and violence; of culture and curiosity over ignorance and dogmatism. Odysseus is not a God, but the man par excellence, with formidable talents as well as human weaknesses and flaws.During his 10 year long journey to Ithaca, his homeland, Odysseus and his crew sailed by an island inhabited by Sirens, mythical creatures whose singing was irresistibly alluring. Whoever listened to their voices was doomed to shipwreck upon their rocky coasts.Odysseus wanted to listen to the beautiful Sirens‚Äô song, but he was also conscious of how difficult it would be to resist to such temptation. He devised a plan. The mythical hero poured wax into his crew‚Äôs ears, to make them temporarily deaf, and ordered them to tie him to the ship‚Äôs mast. No matter what he said, none of his sailors were to free him.Approaching the island, Odysseus heard the song. He screamed to his crew, begged to be liberated and attempted spasmodically to wiggle out of his prison of ropes. The sailors witnessed their captain transfigured by the pain, but kept rowing. They eventually freed their exhausted but thankful captain only when the Sirens‚Äô island was far away.Thousands of years later, we have somehow managed to forget what the ancient Greeks knew so well. Humans are destined to fail if they solely rely on their willpower when facing temptation. We therefore need to understand our innate limitations and devise a strategy, like Odysseus did, if we are to a have a chance in this unbalanced battle.Planning like Odysseus1. The Sirens‚Äô Song. When thinking about the habit we want to change or to acquire, we need to remember a time when willpower alone was not enough and we yielded to temptation. Luckily for us, the Sirens don‚Äôt constantly sing but there are moments when the lure is stronger or our motivation is lower. It is essential to frame these moments and to find a stratagem to counteract them, designing a system of reward and punishment which makes bad behavior expensive and good behavior cheap.2. Picking our Crew. Odysseus, like any captain, was nothing without his crew of loyal sailors. When we decide to embark in a life-changing journey, we have to trust our crew and they have to trust us. We are all conditioned by the environment we live in and by the constant pressure of our peers. It is extremely hard, for example, to stop drinking, smoking or eating junk food when all the people around us indulge in this kind of behaviors. We need to be open with our friends about our desire to change and ask them to respect our decision. If this is not possible, it‚Äôs probably advisable to look for a new, and truer, group of friends.3. Checking the Ship. Like our crew, we also need to control our physical space. Thinking about the long-term and ditching all potential sources of temptation is fundamental to achieving our goals. If we don‚Äôt buy unhealthy snacks when we are in control of impulses, they won‚Äôt be in our kitchen when, after a stressful day, our willpower has dwindled. It is also often useful to be ‚Äúselectively blind‚Äù and to surround ourselves with constant reminders of what we want to achieve. We are all victims of the availability heuristic, and it is wise to use it to our advantage.4. Tying Oneself to the Mast. The last and final piece of the puzzle is entirely on our own shoulders. We need to be willing to execute the plan, to adjust it after a setback and, especially at the beginning, to suffer like Odysseus did when hearing the Sirens‚Äô chant. It is also important to remember that the anguish of Odysseus was not in vain. The Sirens were, in fact, fated to die if a mortal heard their singing and escaped them.In a powerful display of both humility and intelligence, Odysseus taught us this ‚Äî that if we take control of the things that control us then we can control our own behavior. And silence our own Sirens once and for all.",30/05/2019,0,0,11,2,771,513,2,0,0,1,6
Finding Your Peak Productivity,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/finding-your-peak-productivity-3649ae0b0a26,Leanne Johnson,114,4,648,"What if you could get more done in a day without waking up early? You‚Äôd be crazy not to.Most of us have heard of circadian rhythms‚Äîthe ones that help us regulate our sleep-wake cycle‚Äîbut there are many more rhythms our bodies adhere to. The important ones for productivity are ultradian rhythms.Ultradian rhythms are any regular patterns that repeat within a 24 hour period of time. Some include our heartbeats, blinking, and appetite.Research shows that our attention, motivation, and energy levels operate on this same rhythmic system; typically in cycles of 90 to 120 minutes.Great, but how do we harness their power?In order to make the most of your time, you have to know how you spend it. And how you feel about it.You could probably make a spreadsheet to track everything, but I did it by hand because I hate spreadsheets.I used an old hourly planner to keep track of how I spent my time every day and how I felt about it. Specifically, I tracked my focus, motivation, and creativity and energy levels. Those I rated on a scale of 1‚Äì5 and tried to base it on time of day, rather than the tasks I‚Äôd done.After doing this for a few weeks, I started to see some patterns.I‚Äôm lucky enough to work for myself right now, so I can easily make adjustments to my schedule.I learned that I feel most creative and motivated first thing in the morning‚Äîwhich is something of a problem because I am not a morning person. So I try to do all my creative work first thing after getting my butt in the chair. Which, admittedly, some days is 8, others it‚Äôs 10.Instead of breaking for lunch at 12, I usually break between 130 and 2. After I‚Äôve eaten, my attention‚Äîand motivation‚Äîdrops off so I save administrative tasks for after lunch. I also save social media scheduling for Friday afternoons.I have the lowest levels of energy, motivation, and focus on Tuesdays, so I try to schedule all appointments that day.I also learned that the most important time of my whole week is Monday morning. How I spend Monday morning sets the tone for the whole week. If I take the day off and watch Netflix all day, that behaviour will bleed into the whole week.If you don‚Äôt have the luxury of completely overhauling your schedule, rank your taskwork by the amount of focus, motivation, and creativity they require. Once you‚Äôve done that, arrange the tasks, when you can, to correspond with your energy levels and focus throughout the day.There are lots of variables you can play around with while you‚Äôre tracking your time and energies.Also, try single tasking over multi-tasking. When I‚Äôm able to focus on a single thing at a time, I get so much more done than when I‚Äôm bouncing between Twitter, a draft, blogs, and my phone.Be protective of your creative/most productive time. There are only a handful of things I will skip my 10‚Äì1 writing time for‚Äîweekly coffee dates with my dad, my partner, and urgent meetings/calls.Once you have your most productive times daily and weekly, arrange it into your ideal work week.Here‚Äôs mine from my Bullet Journal. And I‚Äôll be the first one to tell you that my weeks rarely actually look like this, but it‚Äôs a goal I‚Äôm striving for.Now, I can‚Äôt lie to you, this takes a lot of time. Tracking all this is a pretty big commitment. Because, like any good science experiment, every time you change a variable, you need to have a good amount of time tracking it before you really know the effects.All in all, I think I tracked all my time and changes to variables for about four months.It‚Äôs definitely worth it in the end. On a good day, I manage to pack way more work into just a few hours than I ever managed when I worked a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,0,1050,1150,2,1,0,3,34
Here‚Äôs How To Edit Your Scenes The Right Way,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/heres-how-to-edit-your-scenes-the-right-way-1f8250d8a147,Sean Platt,546,7,1531,"An emotionally-impactful novel is one where all the scenes drive the plot, characters, and story forward, weaving subplots and symbolism through them, and elucidating theme.But how does a writer manage to make all those things happen?The first step is to write the draft. Get the story out of you without worrying about all the details and nuances that will only become useable once you know what your story is, who the characters are, and what you‚Äôre trying to say. The first draft is not the place for worrying about the proper impact of each and every moment.However, once the story is out of you, you can take a look at what you‚Äôve got and figure out how to make it better.The following questions can be asked for each and every scene in your story, and answering them will help you find problems with the scenes so you can fix it in revision.This is where you note the previous story event that set this scene up. If you can‚Äôt identify the previous event that causes the current scene to happen, it means you have a plot hole (i.e. events happening for no reason or for a flimsy reason).Briefly note how the story is advanced here (new info revealed, new action taken, new conflict created, new decision made). What have the main character(s) gained or lost in the course of this scene? If no one has gained or lost anything in a scene, the scene isn‚Äôt moving the story forward. (Realize that gain and loss aren‚Äôt just about making progress toward the main story goal, they‚Äôre also about the characters‚Äô growth arcs and relationships. A character who loses face has lost something, and a character has learned something new has gained something.)If the scene is there solely for character development, look for a plot event (i.e. conflict) that you can add to it or look for a way to raise tension through suspense. If you can‚Äôt find at least one way that the story is advanced in this scene, it‚Äôs superfluous and ought to be cut.Note what the reader will learn about each of the characters in the scene. If there isn‚Äôt anything to note here, or if there are characters about whom nothing is revealed, look for opportunities to develop these characters in the scene. What could you reveal about the characters that you haven‚Äôt? What aspects of your characters could be stronger?If the story has a theme, note whether or not it‚Äôs touched on in this scene. You don‚Äôt need to touch on theme in every scene, but if a theme is only mentioned in one or two scenes, then it‚Äôs not really a theme, it‚Äôs an idea that got introduced to the story briefly and dropped. This will give you an overview on how strong the theme is by virtue of how many times it‚Äôs touched on, and helps you figure out how to strengthen it if needed.Also, if none of the story‚Äôs themes are advanced in this scene, can you bring one of them into it?Every scene should have at least one surprise. Often, that surprise is the new information which moves the plot forward. Scene surprises can be huge reveals (‚ÄúLuke, I am your father!‚Äù), interesting twists (‚ÄúMy hairdresser used to be special forces? That explains why he always wears camo.‚Äù) or very quiet (‚ÄúI thought he‚Äôd be happy about our dinner plans, but his smile looks strained.‚Äù)The surprise doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge soap-opera style revelation. It could simply be the heroine realizing that she‚Äôs been treating the hero unfairly, or the hero learning that the heroine lied about her whereabouts the night before, or the villain showing unexpected compassion. The quiet surprises are often moments of character development ‚Äî a character realizing something new about themselves or about another character.It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the surprise is always a surprise from the reader‚Äôs point of view.If a character reveals something new about themselves to the reader, that may be your scene surprise: an unexpected action, a small confession in interior monologue, even a bit of subtext that suggests everything is not exactly as it seems ‚Äî when the reader realizes that there‚Äôs more going on than they‚Äôve been aware of, that‚Äôs a surprise. The character doesn‚Äôt have to be surprised by the scene surprise, but the reader does.What hooks the reader into the action? Is there a more exciting way to kick it off? Does the first sentence or paragraph express or imply some sort of conflict? Or raise a question? If the scene doesn‚Äôt start on a compelling hook, such as implied or explicit conflict, or raise suspense via an unanswered question, or an arresting image or intriguing line of dialogue, look for another opening. The exception: when the scene starts with humor, an excellent hook in itself.Is each of the conflicts in this scene big enough? If not, how could you expand the underdeveloped ones? Are there any missing conflicts that should be in the scene? And if the scene doesn‚Äôt have any conflicts at all, could you add some, or should you cut the scene?Insufficient conflict or complete lack of conflict is the number one reason why scenes fall flat. Be diligent about including conflict in every scene. Make your conflicts big. Make them tough for your characters to resolve. Let us see your characters struggle. See if you can find a way for every scene to have both an external and an internal conflict.If not, should there be? If so, should it be emphasized or made less obvious?Each character in a scene should have a scene goal (what they are trying to accomplish right now). Does each character in this scene have a short-term goal they are trying to accomplish? This can be as simple as the hero trying to persuade the heroine to let him sleep in or trying to find a place to eat at 1 a.m. Characters who do not have at least a minor goal tend to come across as boring and existing solely to be puppets for the author, rather than as real people.One way to make the most minor of characters come alive is to give that character a goal and show them actively pursuing it in accordance with a single personality trait or quirk.Note: if your scenes are low in conflict, giving characters goals that make it harder for them to work together is an excellent fix.Are any of the characters behaving in a way that is not consistent with a) their social roles, b) their established personality traits, c) their backstory, or d) their story and scene goals? If not, can you find a way to pull them back into character while still pushing the plot forward?It‚Äôs surprising how often you‚Äôll realize that characters who seemed essential when you were writing the draft can actually be combined into one person or eliminated altogether.Are there any ways you could make it stronger? Is there a setting element that the characters could be interacting with? Does the setting have personal meaning for any of the characters? Does the setting offer any additional obstacles for the characters to wrestle with?Are any new story questions introduced here? Do any previously-raised story questions get answered in this scene? If a story question is raised in the scene and you‚Äôre not sure that it‚Äôs answered later, make a note on the manuscript or on your scene list, so that you can come back to this. By the time you‚Äôve analyzed every scene like this, you‚Äôll know which questions got answered and which did not.If you‚Äôre not sure, look at each sentence and ask if this is how the POV character would say this.Does it raise a question or reveal a surprise or end on a powerful emotion that will make the reader want to turn the page?Don‚Äôt forget to make note of anything that seems off to you as you read the scene ‚Äî inconsistent eye color or something that needs further research or double-checking names.Also take a moment to think about how the changes you‚Äôre contemplating making to this scene might affect earlier scenes. Do you want to give a secondary character a secret that would change his behavior earlier in the story? Do you want to have your heroine break out an awesome kung fu move, but need to mention earlier that she studied it as a child? If so, be sure to make a note to yourself on your revision list for the appropriate scene(s).Once you‚Äôve answered all 16 questions for each scene of your story, you‚Äôll have a clear idea of what‚Äôs working and a list of things you‚Äôd like to change about each scene.You should probably wait until you‚Äôve analyzed all the scenes in your novel before you start rewriting, as some of the things you decide to change in scene thirty may require you to add new elements to scene one. If you start rewriting too soon, you could end up doing work that gets deleted or re-revised.After you‚Äôve got the revision list for each scene of your story, you can rewrite the whole draft with confidence, knowing that you won‚Äôt miss anything.",30/05/2019,2,0,17,1,1050,742,1,0,0,0,412

The Power of Unconventional Marketing,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-unconventional-marketing-15f1bfe10242,Andre Moncayo,33,7,982,"Nothing is more memorable than seeing something confusing, weird or scary in your everyday life. There are always moments that shape and change our views on certain topics, people, locations, and companies. You may not even notice those changes until sit down and think about it. In your life, do you genuinely remember the usual activities you engage in? Do you remember every episode of every season of CSI? Do you remember every commercial or advertisement you see? Because if you do, you either have photographic memory or you‚Äôre lying. However, there‚Äôs always that one memorable moment, that one drastically different episode, or that one ridiculous commercial or ad that sits in your brain for a long time. Some may call these moments unconventional since they break away so drastically from the norm. Seeing or doing something different is what makes it memorable and in the business of marketing, everything needs to be memorable. Eventually, repeating something unusual will gradually become normal, but that‚Äôs when you change it up again. Bring something new to the table that‚Äôs totally unconventional and roll with it for a while. This tactic will make your brand or product unforgettable and the power of unconventional marketing will be in the palm of your hands.Let‚Äôs start off strong with some video examples of unconventional marketing that works.Although these commercials are widely different from each other, they each have something in common; they push to convey their products in memorable ways. ‚ÄúWill It Blend?‚Äù shows the power of their blender using product that people normally would not think about blending. Old Spice decided to get loud and weird with Terry Crews, which makes those ads unforgettable. Aviation Gin has Ryan Reynolds as a spokesperson and presents the drink in a hilariously unrealistic way. Reynolds later does a cross promotional comedy sketch with Hugh Jackman‚Äôs Laughing Man Coffee based on their fake social media feud. Now that‚Äôs genius marketing!Whether you‚Äôre marketing on social media, email or advertisements, creating unique imagery that pops is important across all mediums. You can either be a little weird or very weird. However, it depends on the industry you work in and the image you want your brand to have. Don‚Äôt get too weird if you‚Äôre an insurance company, but get as weird as you want if you‚Äôre a coffee shop. For the rest of this blog, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre an industry that‚Äôs willing to get very creative.Your first stop should be your website. Look it over and ask yourself some questions:Based on your target market, your website should be appealing and different from your competition. Use complementary colors, create an odd but easy to navigate site layout or even a mascot to give your brand a face. Additionally, make sure not to go too overboard with your website. You still need to be able to convey what you‚Äôre selling. If it‚Äôs not easy on the eyes or too complicated to navigate, visitors may leave.Check out these unique websites as an example:Once your website is complete, use your customers as guides to improve. Conduct consumer research and use constructive feedback to make necessary adjustments. You can also use Hotjar for a visual way to understand how users navigate your website.Now that you have an awesome website, it‚Äôs time to get visitors. Content is the key to getting your website found in the first place. Without a steady stream of content, you might as well be invisible. Provide useful content that‚Äôs interesting enough to encourage repeat visitors and social media shares. But as we all know, that‚Äôs easier said than done when everyone is creating blogs, whitepapers, eBooks, infographics, newsletters and videos. So here are some tips that might work for you:Now that you have all this content lying around your website, go and promote it! Post your new content on social media and inject them into your newsletters. Connect with other bloggers and do some guest posts or get them to refer to your relevant blogs. But you‚Äôre not done yet! Now it‚Äôs time to get unconventional on social media with unique posts and follower engagement.Oddly enough, social media can be a tricky beast to tame. If you Google anything about the ‚Äòdo‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of social media‚Äô you‚Äôll come up with a sea of lists giving you stats and rules to follow. You‚Äôll learn all about when to post, what to post, how many hashtags you should use, common social media mistakes and how many dog photos is too many. Well, as helpful as these tips can be, the most important lesson you can learn is to be real and weird. If you aren‚Äôt posting what you or your target market would consider ‚Äòinteresting content,‚Äô than why are you doing it in the first place? Social media is the main place where you can get as creative and weird as possible, so do it.Here are a few examples I found that may be helpful:The title is not meant to discourage you, but to show you the harsh reality of marketing unconventionally. You may post something that doesn‚Äôt connect with customers the way you wanted it to. Maybe you think a post is funny, but followers may think it‚Äôs confusing or just rude. You may even get comments that discuss how ridiculous your post is. Do not let this stop you from attempting something new. If anything, view it as constructive criticism to fuel your next post and make it better. All you can do is try and try again because when you find content that really works, all your time will have been worth it.That‚Äôs it! Marketing is about standing out and giving the people what they want. How you decide to go about it is up to you. Being unconventional is not the easiest or shortest path, but it‚Äôs definitely the most rewarding. So have fun, be patient and get creative.",30/05/2019,0,0,10,0,1050,699,1,4,0,12,154

Steve had decades of experience in producing the news, but he was also jaded, in poor health, and hard-of-hearing. I watched him lean toward the phone‚Äôs cradle. ‚ÄúWhat? No. The police told you to leave. We‚Äôre listening to the scanners. I‚Äôm telling you again, you have to leave the area if you want them to come in and help your friend.‚Äù He hung up the phone.What would I say to the caller, in Steve‚Äôs place? Steve lingered at the news-desk and I hoped that he wouldn‚Äôt disappear for a few hours like he sometimes did before we aired the morning show. The caller would likely call again.Steve‚Äôs responses indicated to me what the caller said: ‚ÄúOur friend has been shot and the ambulance won‚Äôt come and get him!‚Äù The caller was part of a block party that turned chaotic when someone shot the caller‚Äôs friend. The shooter had disappeared into the crowd.In response to the caller‚Äôs plea for our news-station‚Äôs attention, Steve took care in what he said. The police and fire departments knew our newsroom had scanners, and knew we often received calls from people at ‚Äúactive‚Äù scenes. If we divulged too much of what we knew about a scene to any member of the public who called in, we could inadvertently help the perpetrators of a crime, put people in danger, and damage our precarious relationship with the authorities.We needed the police for reliable information on big stories, but many detectives considered talking to the press to be a liability, given our influence on the public‚Äôs view of their performance. The police maintained a low tolerance for anything from us that could be seen as interference. But all that didn‚Äôt matter to me in this instance ‚Äî someone was hurt and needed medical attention. I imagined what I would want to say to the caller while Steve moved from the news-desk and disappeared down the hallway:Listen, the police won‚Äôt let the paramedics get close because they can‚Äôt locate the shooter. Can you see where the ambulances are? Can you carry your friend there? Go now.‚ÄúYou never heard, if it bleeds, it leads?‚Äù Steve tilted back in his desk chair and fixed me with a smug look. I shook my head. It was my first day. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how they decide what story to place in the first block of a show. It was a popular phrase in the late eighties‚Ä¶ and you wouldn‚Äôt believe a place like this back then, and in the decade or so before that.‚Äù Steve gestured to the newsroom and smirked. ‚ÄúThey kept cocaine on top the cabinet in the photographer‚Äôs room and‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve‚Äôs smirk spread into a smile, and he shook his head. ‚ÄúWe were all rock stars, before there was cable news.‚ÄùOur news-station‚Äôs priority was to keep viewers tuned in, and our producers structured their newscasts with this in mind. The lead story was always a flashy one (a fire, or an unsolved crime) and the weather forecast was always last. Viewers tuned in for the lead story, and then kept the show on so that they wouldn‚Äôt miss the weather report. To maintain that interest, producers ‚Äúteased‚Äù the weather segment in brief intervals throughout the show. Shows with extreme weather as the lead story pulled in the highest ratings, and ratings were king. Higher ratings meant a bigger draw for advertisers.At first, I liked chasing stories and writing about current events. But rarely did the humanity of a story make it into the report ‚Äî just the what, who, when, how and why a viewer should care, which almost always was because this could happen to you, and if you are not aware, then you‚Äôll be a hapless victim too. A few months into the job, I had a dream that I was being crushed under an immense, inescapable weight. I woke up in a panic. I felt anxious all the time, and as though I, or my humanity, fought for a handhold in quicksand. Finally I realized: In my employer‚Äôs view, compassion wasn‚Äôt newsworthy, and in my view, no one could live without it.A refresher on the difference between morals and ethics: morals are internal, and based on personal principles of right and wrong; whereas ethics are external, and often set by a society or other authoritative group, like the code of ethics for a doctor or lawyer. A worker may adhere to a code of professional ethics, while feeling differently on their own moral level. An attorney who knows her client is guilty, but strives for their freedom because she is ethically obligated to give them the best defense possible, is an example.Workplace values and culture also have different definitions. Values rarely change, and form the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind a company‚Äôs purpose, while a company‚Äôs culture is constantly shifting as employees join and depart ‚Äî or so says Alex Bard, CEO of Campaign Monitor. In my experience at the news station, the value of delivering news in a style that kept the viewer enthralled drove the newsroom‚Äôs practices, though their stated ethics promised fair and unbiased reporting.When I first started out on my own, and for the majority of my career, I thought that I carried my morals around with me in a mental back pocket, where they were readily available. I didn‚Äôt have to think about my morals to benefit from them ‚Äî they were a subconscious positive influence, like breathing. But when I reached for my morals during instances involving gray areas, I was often left unsure of where I stood. I was troubled by the news-station‚Äôs influence over the public, who never asked what morals or values the news station embraced. Now I benefit from a definite list of my moral principles, and I hope to inspire you to create your own.To help you identify your own moral principles, see the following list of morals that you likely have in common with people all over the world, according to an article from The Evolution Institute. Author Oliver Scott Curry defines morality, based on his findings, as ‚Äúa collection of tools for promoting cooperation.‚Äù While I agree with that scientific view, my morals feel more personally, than collectively, beneficial. I do, however, see how adhering to moral principles benefits everyone. Here‚Äôs the list of seven common morals from different cultures around the world:Coincidentally, this list matches my own personal morals almost exactly. I am also happy to say that my current company‚Äôs culture and values do not conflict with any moral on my list. I wish I realized the importance of this pairing long ago. I now believe that to thrive at work, your list of morals and your company‚Äôs values must not clash.I imagine the following scenario, a ‚Äúre-do‚Äù, for when I worked at the news station. I am suffering from anxiety that manifests as insomnia, terrible eating habits, and poor health, prompting introspection which leads me to make a list of my morals. I compare that list to the news-station‚Äôs practices, and I realize that my anxiety stems from discomfort and guilt. I decide to leave the news station, not because I feel like I am not good at the job, but because the job is not good for me.In reality, when I eventually left the news station it was with a feeling of overall dissatisfaction and disappointment, and of failure, and I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why. I packed up my things, moved out of my apartment, and headed for my childhood home. I had no career direction in mind, and my self-confidence was at an all-time low. I wish I knew before then, what I know now ‚Äî that keeping a definite list of personal morals close at hand is like keeping a trusty flashlight in your back pocket.This article is one in a series on lessons I learned during my quirky career path. Topics include job-interview blunders, how to deal with conflict, and a better mindset for mistakes, to name a few.Feeling overwhelmed or unfulfilled at work? Or, can‚Äôt believe how lucky you are? I‚Äôve been there, and I have lessons to share. I hope you find them helpful.Originally published at http://authoralisawilson.com on May 30, 2019.",30/05/2019,0,0,3,8,1003,550,1,1,0,3,29
Do You Even Have an Inner Artist?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/do-you-even-have-an-inner-artist-6a0db92a79bc,Teresa Funke,407,3,592,"When people ask what my blog is about, I often say it‚Äôs an inspirational blog to help people tap into and support their inner artist. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs not for me,‚Äù some reply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not creative. And I‚Äôm certainly not an artist.‚ÄùI‚Äôm always a little surprised by that response. It makes me realize somewhere down the line we all formed opinions of what a creative person is. Mostly, we think of creative people as those who work or dabble in the traditional arts (music, dance, writing, painting, etc.). Or people who use their creativity to develop new products or services. Or people who work in ‚Äúcreative fields,‚Äù like graphic artists or architects or craft brewers.Why do we do that? Why do we put boxes around our art? Why do we label our creativity? With so many changes that need to be made in our world right now, so many big problems to solve, so many people to help, we need an army of inner artists to tackle the challenges we face. Now is not the time to deny you even have an inner artist, now is the time to ask him to step up.Some of the most creative, most brilliant people I know are not professional artists. They‚Äôre not even hobby artists. But they‚Äôll tell me a story about a new program they proposed that will improve their home life, community, or workplace.‚ÄúHow did you come up with that idea?‚Äù I ask.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It just came to me,‚Äù they say.In truth, they had first identified a problem, then wondered if it could be solved, then started hearing the whispers of their inner artist who had an idea that just might work. Our inner artists work with the tools they are given: our talents, skills, experience, frustrations, fears, and mostly our imaginations. And from that, they create art.We do it every day, all day. Maybe you‚Äôre sick of eating the same old meals, so you experiment and toss some new ingredients into a pot. Or you notice something broken in your house and, rather than pitching it, you devise a clever way to fix it. Or you tire of explaining a lesson in the same old way, so you come up with a new way to say it. In all those cases, your inner artist was at work. How do you know? Because you feel damn good when you‚Äôre done! That‚Äôs your inner artist offering you a high five.I have a friend who is constantly rearranging the furniture in her house and painting and repainting the same walls. Why does she do it? Why does she keep moving furniture around when it‚Äôs fine where it is? Because it makes her happy. Because it‚Äôs something she and her inner artist can do together. What if she were to take her ‚Äúart‚Äù to her workplace? What if she rearranged the conference room furniture in such a way that everyone felt a lift in energy when they entered the room? How much more productive would that day‚Äôs meeting be?Quit denying your inner artist. Quit shunning her to the corner to sit with her head hung down like a child in time out. Trust your creativity, however it manifests.There is no right or wrong way to be creative.There is no right or wrong place to be creative.There is no right or wrong time to be creative.Do you have an inner artist? Of course, you do! So, turn him/her loose today, and let‚Äôs light up this world.Originally published on the Bursts of Brilliance‚Ñ¢ for a Creative Life blog.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,4,1050,700,1,0,0,3,153
Literary Biography: How Childhood Books Shape Us,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/literary-biography-how-childhood-books-shape-us-eba38069d44b,Megan Bidmead,235,7,1426,"I read Bookworm by Lucy Mangan last year (and reviewed it here). It‚Äôs an exploration of childhood reading. It is a wonderful, warm, nostalgic trip into the past, and I highly recommend it.During the Access course I took for my degree, one of the things we were taught in our first unit was Linguistic Biographies, i.e., what places, people, and events shape the way we speak. One of the activities we had to do was to identify our own linguistic biography. It highlighted, to me, how many outside influences shape us. (It also did nothing to dispel the idea that, in my mind, daps are NOT called daps, they are called plimsolls, and the entire West Country have got it wrong.)Surely, then, people have a literary biography? A collection of books that have fundamentally shaped who we became, what we believed about the world and the people in it, even the way we speak and behave? I started wondering about the books I used to read as a kid, and how they might have changed me. So, with that in mind, here are some lessons my much-loved childhood classics taught me:I mean, Dahl has given power to plucky little kids in order to save the day in many of his stories. It‚Äôs like his main theme. Who has the nerve to conquer corrupt adults and their stupid ways? Kids. Who can we count on to save the world? Kids! And there‚Äôs no kid quite like Matilda. (Side note, I read Mara Wilson‚Äôs autobiography recently, a woman who I understand is NOT Matilda, but will always be, in my mind, inextricably linked to her. It‚Äôs an excellent book, you should read it.) Although I couldn‚Äôt relate to Matilda‚Äôs unsupportive and frankly monstrous parents, I COULD relate to her being very tiny and super into books. I could relate to her wanting to bring down a mean teacher. And I admired her wit and courage and her purity of heart, despite her terrible parents. Yes, she has superpowers, but you know, she‚Äôs awesome and clever without them.Harry and Ron would have literally died without Hermione. Why? Because she‚Äôs smart and brave and strong and one of my favourite female characters of all time. Also why? Because she‚Äôs prepared. They might have teased her for all those hours spent in the library, but there were many times when Hermione‚Äôs knowledge of obscure potions or ancient wizarding history helped to unlock a problem that would have basically stopped the boys in their tracks. Knowledge is power. Many times being prepared by simply reading about a topic has helped me pull through a situation. Be prepared, and if in doubt, go to the library.I‚Äôll always hold Jacqueline Wilson dear to my heart. She knew how to burrow into the heart of an issue, pull out all its painful problems and obstacles, and create a character that, if not able to conquer it, was at least able to come to terms with it. She dealt with homelessness, adoption, parental abandonment, illness, bereavement ‚Ä¶ you name a problem, Wilson has a book about it. Many of her books starred characters who, for some reason, didn‚Äôt fit in, and other kids were mean to them about it. And you usually discovered that the bullies were putting on a front, or having terrible problems at home. Her books were clever in that they made me empathise with the outsiders, yes, but they also made me rethink why people bully in the first place.I mean this is not a life lesson as such, but it is DEFINITELY a lasting legacy of my childhood reading.I was a Nickelodeon kid in the 90s. At the time, the Olsen Twins were full-blown famous, and I kind of loved and hated them in equal measure, with their perfect half-straight half-curly blonde hair and their perfect straight teeth and their perfect cropped jeans and chokers and platform shoes.Anyway, my obsession with twins started way earlier, thanks to my sisters leaving their books behind for me when they grew out of them. We had a few Sweet Valley High books, and they were fascinating to me. (Again, what is it with blonde, perfectly-tanned, perfect-teethed twins? They‚Äôre almost magical. Like unicorns.) The Sweet Valley High twins ‚Äî I only realised this as I got older ‚Äî live in a weird soap-opera world where everything, literally everything, revolves around these two perfect human beings. But man, I loved those books at the time, and I was in awe at how many of them I found at the library. Did you know that there were 181 Sweet Valley Highbooks altogether? It only occurred to me in the last couple of years, as in almost in my thirties, that many of them were ghost written. Duh.And then Jacqueline Wilson released Double Trouble, a brilliant book about identical twins with opposite personalities, and again, it just reinforced how flipping awesome it would be to be a twin. All the stories I wrote for the next few years involved twins.And I still think they‚Äôre kind of cool.Taking Hogwarts out of the equation here (because I was too old to believe in Hogwarts being real and yet I really wished that it was, so I could take care of magical creatures and turn into cats and narrowly avoid death once every academic year with Harry and his friends), I loved the idea of boarding school. In my imagination it was an alter-ego that went to boarding school, the part of me that would be brave enough to leave my parents to go.This is mostly down to Trebizon.Published between 1978 and 1994, the Trebizon series by Anne Digby follows Rebecca and her friends as they experience teenage life in a very posh boarding school for girls. I say posh, because it was. They had tennis courts, and a beach across the road, and beautiful leafy oak trees under which you could lay and read poetry and argue about hockey matches. I wanted to have that life, or rather, I wanted my alter-ego to have that life. The best adventures seem to happen at boarding schools.However, at boarding schools, there is a chance you will a) die a horrible death (Harry Potter) b) be severely neglected (The Worst Witch series). I mean, this is possibly just applicable to magical schools, but you never know.One of my earliest memories is watching Bambi and being utterly terrified by the Mum-gets-shot scene (despite not really understanding what was happening). There are many stories from my childhood that scared me, and so it has been since the days of Grimm‚Äôs fairytales. I mean, just ask the legions of people that grew up hiding behind the sofa cushions from the first-generation Daleks. Stray, by A.A Milne, is the life story of a stray cat, and the sheer amount of death, fear and sadness that happens in that book is mind-boggling when I look back on it now. The Secret of Nihm is, of course, a classic tale about a mother mouse who appeals to the dark and mysterious rats to help save her critically ill son, and both the book and the film scared the life out of me. Similarly, The Witches had me totally entranced, and yet terrified.I‚Äôm a firm believer in that a little bit of fear is good for kids, though. Books are safe spaces to explore tough subjects. But maybe I won‚Äôt let my daughter read Stray just yet.One of the main messages in the Harry Potter series is the one that Dumbledore gives the school after Cedric Diggory dies: ‚ÄòRemember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy ‚Ä¶‚Äô it‚Äôs an iconic speech and one that resonates strongly with Harry, who continues to choose the path of ‚Äòright‚Äô even when there are many easier options. This is a classic theme of children‚Äôs literature, and something every child can relate to. Even as an adult, I sometimes remember those words when I have a choice to make. Will I do what is right, or what is easy?Big and small, books have left an imprint on me growing up. I keep an eye out for the classics from my childhood in charity shops. There‚Äôs something really nostalgic about my own copies, though. About thumbing through the worn pages, seeing my maiden name in wobbly child‚Äôs handwriting on the front page. I wish I‚Äôd kept more of them. And I can‚Äôt help but wonder which books will teach my kids lessons, too.",30/05/2019,1,0,0,13,1050,787,1,0,0,1,44
(Unexpected) Things I Don‚Äôt Miss About Freelance,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/unexpected-things-i-dont-miss-about-freelance-34081d9c06fe,Masha S,421,3,291,"I started working at LogicManager as a developer/designer in December. At that time, I just graduated from Brandeis and this was my first full-time position. I used to freelance and work part-time in college, but never had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù 9‚Äì5 job.The idea of working full-time scared me. I was afraid that by the end of the first month, I would get bored of going to the same place five days a week and doing the same thing eight hours a day. Up to that point, every day was different ‚Äî classes and internship one day, freelance and homework the other, etc. I thought it was a fun schedule and I took pride in not being a part of the 9‚Äì5 grind.After all, I have been doing that for four years‚Ä¶ but it was all about to change.However, as it turned out, my worries were unfounded. Not only was I not bored, I actually started to feel less stressed and happier overall.The moral of the story is that if you have done something one way for a long time, it doesn‚Äôt mean that it is the best way for you. It might simply be a habit. You might be sure that it makes you happy, but in reality, you are just used to it. You ignore the negatives because you treat them as an inevitable part of life and you are afraid of changes because there‚Äôs no guarantee that the trade offs and the stress of transitioning will be worth it. You‚Äôll never know until you try though.(And I am only saying all this, because that‚Äôs exactly how I felt, at the time).Thank you for reading!

You Might Want to Put That Biodegradable Fork Down,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/you-might-want-to-put-that-biodegradable-fork-down-c78f6109e6b6,Victoria Halina,394,3,618,"Did you know that it can take a piece of lettuce up to 30 years to decompose in a landfill? In a project commissioned by the University of Arizona in 1973, it was found that hot dogs, corn cobs and grapes were unearthed intact after 25 years.Shocking right?Who knew it could take organic matter such a long time to break down in a landfill. And if it‚Äôs taking a piece of lettuce that long to decompose, then you can bet your biodegradable-fork-eating-butt that biodegradable products are taking the same amount of time.The problem is two-fold.Globally, we‚Äôre producing a whopping 1.3 billion tons of landfill waste annually, with a projected increase to 2.2 billion tons by 2025. We have to ask, why are these numbers growing at such an alarming rate?One of the reasons is that landfills are not designed to promote natural biodegradation necessary to recycle organic materials down back into the Earth. Space is money, and in order to save space, garbage is crushed or compacted together. Because of this, landfills become anaerobic.Landfills being anaerobic means that no oxygen exists inside them‚Äîan essential element for enzymes and microbes to break down matter.When it comes to breaking down matter in a landfill, the right conditions to promote decomposition do not exist ‚Äî namely warmth, light, water, oxygen and microbial activity. These environmental factors are needed in order for microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to naturally break down materials. Without them there is no chance for metabolic or enzymatic processes to reduce waste build up.On top of that, due to the anaerobic nature of landfills, methane is released at a steady rate, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.Globally, trash releases nearly 800 million metric tons (882 million tons) of CO2.If food that has ended up in a landfill cannot biodegrade naturally, then there is no chance biodegradable materials will either.Since the introduction of ‚Äúbioplastics‚Äù in the late 1980s as a response to the ever-increasing environmental challenge that plastics and packaging posed, the biodegradable materials industry began to rapidly develop.According to a paper on biodegradable packaging in the food industry, the ‚Äúaccumulation of plastic in the environment, reduction of arable land, have prompted efforts to develop biodegradable packaging / plastics‚Äù.The global biodegradable materials market has now grown significantly, valued at USD 6.61 billion in 2017, and is expected to reach a value of USD 15.24 billion by 2023.Companies, such as Unilever and P&G, have pledged to move to natural packaging solutions and reduce ecological footprint by 50%.This is problematic because an entire industry has assumed that their biodegradable products will actually biodegrade.Whether or not a product is biodegradable depends on where it ends up. Any misdirection poses a huge threat to the environment, and manufacturing biodegradable materials is the equivalent of slapping a sustainability-plaster on the entire landfill problem.If biodegradable packaging ends up in landfills, it can be just as destructive and harmful as conventional packaging.In the face of landfill waste increasing to 2.2 billion tons by 2025, the biodegradable material industry will hardly help to improve a looming problem.There is no easy answer to this question.A quick answer would be to say ‚Äòget rid of landfills‚Äô, but that is not feasible ‚Äî at least not in the near future.A possible answer is to place an onus on biodegradable material manufacturers to either alter their technology, or to work with waste management companies and governments to ensure landfills are decomposing naturally and safely.An interesting answer could be to look towards startups to disrupt the waste industry.When it all boils down to it, if an entire industry is proximate to the global waste dilemma, it should be their responsibility to help solve it too.",30/05/2019,0,0,4,1,691,561,2,0,0,6,49
How To Start Going From Freelancer To Becoming An Entrepreneur,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-business-to-run-without-you-eventually-238d5e958bbf,Marilyn Wo,1500,7,1290,"What would you do to grow a business that can run on its own? 4 years since I started a graphic design productized service, I‚Äôve been cutting down my work hours from 60 hours a week then, to 10 hours a week now.This year, most of my time is spent hustling to increase my customer base from 10 to 24 customers. It has fallen to 6 customers and rise to 12, then down to 7. The numbers may not look good all the time, and though I‚Äôve yet to do better, I‚Äôm learning a lot along the way.In this article, I‚Äôm sharing what I‚Äôve learned to build my business to run without me.Yes, in order for your business to run on its own without you, it also logically means you have to hire people to carry out specific tasks that you were supposed to do to deliver the goods.My mistake in the past was to think that is the only thing I needed to hand‚Äôs off and do anything I wanted to do with my time. So I hired a virtual assistant to handle some tasks that I know she can help me with.Since these tasks are to be done daily, such as making small graphic amendments to client design work, I hired her on a monthly basis and pay her each month.At that time I thought ‚Äú Yay! Now I‚Äôve grown as a ‚Äúsolopreneur‚Äù from 0 to 1 employee ‚Äú. That was in 2017 and didn‚Äôt know I had the wrong mindset until some of my customers started to leave because they don‚Äôt have any more graphic work for me to help with.Those days were stressful because I started to have less income yet I had to pay my virtual assistant the same amount every month not having to do anything. Every morning she emails to ask if I had anything she can help with and I had to spend time searching for something for her to do.This made me realise, growing a business is not just to hire people to help. Growing a business includes the sales and marketing of one‚Äôs services. As we hire one member to support a group of customers, we have to hustle to promote the services that allow us to in turn hire more members to support the growing groups of customers.I‚Äôve struggled forever dealing with the mysterious ‚Äúniche‚Äù for my business. The reason is that it causes a FOMO or Fear Of Missing Out syndrome.What happens if you choose a niche to target? To me, it‚Äôs a success in itself because choosing one may mean I‚Äôm letting go another. I understand the concept of ‚Äúif you sell to everyone, you see to no one‚Äù. But my challenge has always been the decision-making process rather than the niche itself.My business deals with graphic design and this kind of service is easily required by many people and businesses. When I was doing my research on choosing the niche to target, I was able to decide on one niche and a few days down the road, another niche stood out to be quite a good target, and that‚Äôs when I got distracted to switch the niche to target.In 2018, I knew this syndrome had to stop. What I finally decided was to quickly decide on one by working with the closest people I know who already are using graphics to build their brand.I started to work with business coaches who mentor corporates to start their own side hustles and eventually escape the 9 to 5 for good. It‚Äôs not just getting to know them, but getting the job done. What it means to them is not so much about the look of the graphic. The design aspect is obviously an expected criterion.Getting the job done for them means making sure errors in their content are down to zero, as perfect as possible so that back and forth communication is minimized. They don‚Äôt want to keep checking the same work over and over again. This reduces time and effort spent on their part.This does not just work for business coaches, but everyone else. Hence, learning to get the job done for one niche, I can replicate the same thing everywhere else in other niches.In the past, I never would have imagined myself giving up my role in doing the design work. Now I‚Äôm at a stage where we have designers doing what they are good at for the customers and for themselves to become more skilled at what they do.As for myself, I have to look at the bigger picture.In the beginning, yes I was running the show on my own, honing my craft as a designer, doing nothing else, not even marketing. 90% of my customers came from word-of-mouth. The other 10% was my desperate measures doing cold-calling, cold-emails, cold-messages to ask around if people need help.If this is something you are fine with, that works. But in my case, I realised it‚Äôs not helping me reach a point where I can leave my business running on its own if anything happens to me.Besides the hiring and marketing, as the owner of the business, I carry the weight on my shoulders to make sure we get the job done for customers and all employees feel safe knowing what to do next.Hence, in 2017, I came up with an organisational chart:This chart looks great with many positions labelled, but don‚Äôt be fooled, our business hasn‚Äôt reached half of this yet. I believe we will get there and you will if you are intending to go this route.Anyway, the point of this chart is to clearly map out every area of our business that will help to serve our customers. Yes, we want to hire people to help us, yes we want to grow our team. But we can‚Äôt do that until we know which areas we need help with and decide which departments we want to create first.Take each department as a small or tiny startup of the business. There‚Äôs no need for you to be an expert in each of the department, though I would find out more and learn a bit about it first.In my case, I make sure that my customers have what they need first by hiring the number of designers sufficient to fulfil their jobs. As this is going on, I am heading the marketing and sales department of nobody.Currently, I‚Äôd rather be the one doing the front-end promoter because I can have first-hand information on what prospects are looking for. While doing so, I‚Äôm bringing in more customers in the door, taking lots of notes and learning the best way to listen to them.This is to ensure our service product is working well for a big enough market to sustain. Eventually, this marketing department will be taken from my hands to a leader to head this team with the processes I‚Äôve created from the start.This is not impossible. It may not be on your first try, but based on @mikemichalowicz and his book Clockwork, you can do that along the way like what I‚Äôm doing now. Otherwise, you may not have to be the one working on the deliverables to your customers but hire people to work on them right from the start.Then you may say ‚Äú I have to write articles every day to guest blog, go on podcasts or do content marketing to sell your services, that‚Äôs work too! ‚Äú.

Difficult Clients Are Very Much Like Toddlers.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/difficult-clients-are-very-much-like-toddlers-2de026ccdc90,Teresa Lagerman,211,5,297,"When you start freelancing, you‚Äôre giddy with the possibilities in front of you. Doing the work you love, setting your own schedule, saying goodbye to the rats on the subway. But you‚Äôre also quickly overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of, well, finding work, and the instability of good months and slower months. And just when you‚Äôre starting to get the hang of it, that dreaded monster rears its head under the bed ‚Äî the difficult client.Everybody has a different picture of what makes a client difficult. Figuring out the core traits of your own pain-in-the-neck type really helps you identify them and gently (yet swiftly) steer them in a different direction before they become an issue. For me, it‚Äôs three things:These big red flags are different for everyone, but once you know what traits to look out for, you can spot these difficult types a mile away before wasting any time and energy. Becoming more skilled at choosing your clients is a catalyst to help your business grow. When you have good chemistry with a client and your values and expectations are aligned, the project is more likely to be successful, and the client will be more inclined to recommend you to their connections.Despite all the fine-tuning and careful listening, a lemon will slip through once in a while, or you might get into a difficult situation with a good client. And that‚Äôs when I tap into the lessons I learned raising two very different but equally mystifying toddlers.It‚Äôs hard being the adult in the room when someone is throwing a tantrum, but it comes with the job. Remembering that you‚Äôre half of the equation and adjusting how you deal with tough situations with clients will change your perspective, and in time, hopefully, lead to fewer tantrums.",30/05/2019,1,0,8,4,1050,700,1,2,0,3,112
Rare Earth Exports,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/rare-earth-exports-e939e2b60dd,Grant Nordby,417,4,798,"China‚Äôs Trump Card in the Trade War?The U.S.-China trade war is heating up, and China is done playing nice.After the recent increase in proposed tariffs by the Trump administration during ongoing negotiations signaled a marked increase in tensions between China and the United States. An official public notice was released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, outlining the increase of current tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent.President Trump has also threatened to impose new tariffs on an additional $325 billion worth of products.The United States has an advantage in the current trade war that has thus far been based solely on tariffs simply because the United States imports more Chinese goods and therefore the number of goods and industries affected will be greater. However, China has also shown a willingness to be strategic in the tariffs they impose.China has targeted soybean, fruits, nuts, and pork from states that Trump carried in the 2016 election and will be key to his re-election. Indeed, Beijing issued a propaganda notice to Chinese media explaining the official game plan for handling the issue. This leaked document explained the tariffs were designed as a wedge to split ‚Äúapart different domestic groups in the US.‚ÄùAdditionally, analysis from the New York Times shows maps from the 2016 election and the retaliatory tariffs from China. It is clear from the maps that areas of Trump support are being targeted as a means to erode support. There is some proof that the strategy is working and even in areas where Trump enjoys the strongest support patience is running out among voters.This week China has threatened to increase tariffs on precious rare earth materials, which would exploit its greatest advantage in the trade war mostly centered on tariffs.Rare earth metals refer to 17 elements that are prized for their unique magnetic and electrochemical properties.These elements which include lanthanum, gadolinium, cerium, and promethium have been designated as critical by the US Geological Survey for sectors critical to national defense.Rare earth metals and alloys are used in devices ranging from rechargeable batteries, cell phones, catalytic converters, magnets, fluorescent lights and much more. Portable goods in particular are driving demand and as demand for these goods increase so has the demand for rare earth materials.China is the largest producer of rare earths. And it isn‚Äôt particularly close. Chinese production accounts for about 70% of global production.Just as demand for portable devices has driven demand for precious metals, it has led to a reliance on Chinese production. Dependency in trade leads to the potential for economic coercion.China has exploited dependence on rare earth materials in trade disputes before. In 2010, Chinese customs officials were reported to have halted shipments of precious rare earth materials on their way to Japan. This was in response to a disputes over fishing in waters that are claimed by both China and Japan. The link between the shipment delay and the dispute was later refuted by a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson.This is simply another sign of deterioration of trade relations between the United States and China.First, it seems to be a tit-for-tat retaliation against the U.S. blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. which cut off the supply of American components China relies on for network gear and smartphone production. Huawei was later granted reprieve giving three months for negotiation, but its relationship with Google and US chip manufacturers has been hurt.Second, the US would have to turn to more expense domestic production or imports. Japan, France, Estonia are the other largest producers of rare earth materials combined with all other producers they make up on 20 percent of rare-earth production, which falls far short of the supply necessary to overcome a Chinese boycott of the US market. Bringing more production online would be expensive and could take over a year.Third, at the very least this shows China‚Äôs willingness to continue trade war escalation. Although the negotiations seemed to be coming to a close earlier this month and a path forward seemed clear, after the Trump administration blew up negotiations by increasing the current tariffs, China proved that they believe they can outlast the United States.Lastly, and most importantly, this seems like a step towards an all-out trade war in which both countries are willing to experience damage on their own economy as long as greater damage is done to the opposition. While US technology companies and US consumers will almost certainly face higher prices on some of the markets highest priced items, China will also lose market share in the world‚Äôs largest economy.As always, I don‚Äôt pretend to have all the answers. I would love to hear your thoughts on the current US-China trade relationship and the potential for China to restrict rare earth materials.

Getting Anxiety Over Things You Don‚Äôt Fear,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/getting-anxiety-over-things-you-dont-fear-2c5de3c4eef0,Maddy Nicole Heeszel,28,6,1208,"Any of the latter three can be correct. Anxiety disorders, or even a temporary period of anxiety not tied to a psychological disorder, can certainly start with a specific fear of something. However, an anxiety disorder or temporary period of anxiety can also begin with a chemical imbalance, vitamin deficiency, or something unrelated to fear. This then causes us to experience anxiety and leads us to believe that certain stimuli that we come in contact with are our true, innate fears.The idea of this post is to point out that it is possible to get anxiety over things you know you don‚Äôt fear deep down. Anxiety is a complex sensation, cognitive process, experience, and emotional rollercoaster. Anxiety can seem like a chicken-or-the-egg scenario. The truth is, anxiety can seem like an endless cycle because your true fears can trigger your anxiety, and your anxiety can trigger new fears.For example, if Maria was involved in a traumatic car accident and developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of it, her anxiety disorder would have started with fear, or specifically, trauma. However, if Nolan has suffered from an anxiety disorder since he was 10-years-old and never really knew why but then suddenly developed a phobia regarding eating foods of certain colors and textures once his anxiety disorder got worse over time, the assumption might be that he developed the phobia after and even as a result of his general anxiety. However, it is still possible that Nolan had an innate, underlying fear of eating specific foods even before his anxiety disorder came into play and that his phobia was merely exasperated rather than caused by the anxiety disorder itself or vice versa.Based on the latter examples, it‚Äôs obvious that anxiety disorders are never a one-fits-all situation. They are incredibly intricate and are rarely easy to decipher and completely understand.Nevertheless, as you delve deeper into your anxiety journey, it‚Äôs important that you are aware that just because you are anxious regarding something does not mean you necessarily fear it. Understanding that there are some things that make you anxious but don‚Äôt fear can allow you to learn how to separate your true self from your anxious self.Knowing how to pinpoint whether your anxiety or fear(s) ‚Äúcame first‚Äù is vital as it can help you and professionals understand how to get you the help you need to aid with your anxiety. For instance, in Maria‚Äôs scenario, she might require some sort of therapy to talk through her fear post-accident and possibly medication to aid with some of the symptoms. However, in Nolan‚Äôs case, he may or may not only require medication, that is, if his initial anxiety disorder preceded his food aversions and general fears regarding eating certain foods, and thus, if his anxiety disorder is addressed, his eating phobia may also disappear along with it.It should be pretty clear how a fear can trigger the start of an anxiety disorder. However, you might be wondering how having an anxiety disorder can cause someone to develop fabricated fears, fears that they might have ever had if their anxiety disorder never came into existence.There isn‚Äôt truly a single answer for this. However, I can still provide my insight as someone who also struggles with anxiety disorders.For me personally, my generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) begun for seemingly no apparent reason; it was something I always seemed to have and could not explain for the life of me. Then my anxiety developed into agoraphobia, the fear of being in certain places, away from one‚Äôs comfort zone (e.g., home) for fear overbearing panic or anxiety would strike.Like my GAD, my agoraphobia was not a result of trauma, abuse, or any sort of fear directly related to no longer wanting to leave the house. I didn‚Äôt get in a car accident, witness a heart-racing violent encounter, nor did I suffer from a near-death experience. Rather, my agoraphobia began after suffering from prolonged, severe anxiety and stress that were never tended to, which then resulted in me struggling with panic attacks, and eventually, led to me being completely housebound due to my false fear of leaving the house.While I knew deep down that it wasn‚Äôt leaving the house that scared me (in fact, I wanted to so badly), it was the anxiety and panic themselves that I feared. Ironically, my brain was the one who thought I feared leaving the house, and thus, led me to believe I should stay home forever. In reality, all it wanted to do was protect me and help me meet my basic need to feel safe and secure, but like us, our brains can misunderstand.What‚Äôs interesting is that an anxiety disorder can begin or exasperate due to one fear and then cause you to develop a new ‚Äúfear.‚Äù This technically happened to me. While my agoraphobia didn‚Äôt begin due to a fear of leaving the house, it did start as a result of a series of other, more mild fears (which may also have been fabricated once I developed GAD). As a result of the stronger anxiety and newly-developed agoraphobia, I then began to suffer from hypochondria, a fear of breathing, a fear of my heart beating too quickly or too slowly, the list goes on ‚Äî all because my system was already in a heightened, anxious state and clicked so easily with new phobias and fears. Interestingly, prior to developing agoraphobia, I struggled many years with a fear of failure, not being perfect, and generally a phobia of messing up or embarrassing myself. The latter fears can be due to underlying self-consciousness or even a flawed perception of what life truly is: imperfect, spontaneous, and not always according to plan.All in all, my point here isn‚Äôt to get insight or an evaluation for my own struggles with anxiety, but rather, allow sufferers of anxiety and others to understand how complicated an anxiety disorder can really be. The good news is, though, that just because you have an anxiety disorder does not mean you always have underlying fears or a ‚Äúdistorted consciousness.‚Äù Anxiety can absolutely erupt seemingly out of the blue and can be a disorder on its own rather than something ‚Äúcaused by you.‚Äù Likewise, the fears your brain creates can also come about merely due to your already-anxious state of mind, not necessarily because you ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to fear those things or because you have a deep trauma or dark past with the fear you‚Äôve developed.Although it can be frightening when you have anxiety towards something when you are 100% sure you don‚Äôt genuinely fear that thing, this can be a good thing. It means your brain is not only working in terms of trying to protect you (though it may be doing more harm than good), but this also is a reminder that you are not your anxiety; your anxiety is a disorder, sometimes a result of your brain misunderstanding your surroundings and the stimuli it comes across. As hard as it is, bask happily in the idea that you and your anxiety disorder are two distinct ‚Äúparts‚Äù of you. Often, you and your anxiety disorder will not see eye-to-eye, and that is okay because in the end, you are still your beautiful, unique self.Originally published at http://theworriedwordsmith.blogspot.com.",31/05/2019,0,0,9,4,1050,700,1,1,0,3,60

Mistakes I Learned While Blogging About Blockchain The Past 3 Years,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/mistakes-i-learned-while-blogging-about-blockchain-the-past-3-years-278ae15393b0,Menajem Benchimol,122,4,662,"I fell in the blockchain rabbit hole late 2016 when a friend of mine introduced me to Ethereum. I was fascinated by the potentials this technology had for the future of many industries, so I took it upon myself to learn as much as I can. What better way to learn something new in depth?Write and teach about! So that's what I did, I wrote about as many topics as possible to get my head around this broad industry that consisted some understanding of economics, technology, social behavior, politics, cryptography, and much more.As someone picking up a new skill, a person is bound to make mistakes and I am no different.I want to share these articles I wrote in the past that I got wrong.I wrote this article back in new years eve, 2018. It was 4 PM, I wanted to write something captivating/controversial before the year ended. I picked up a topic that was trendy, required little research, and could potentially go viral due to the hype there was at that time.What I got wrong- You see, back then I thought the cryptocurrency was called Ripple, not XRP and had no idea how centralized the organization was. One thing I will give Ripple credit for is that they are trying to solve a problem (cross border transactions) speaking in the language of its customers (banks). Also, I was reckless predicting the addition of a cryptocurrency to an exchange to the 14,000 people that read this article.Dear newbies- read this Messari post about the supply if you want to trade this cryptocurrency, and don't provoke the XRP army on Twitter.This article was written at the time Tezos was concluding its $400+ Million ICO. I had decided to write an article about Tezos after following the development of its inside battle of control between legal advisors and founders.What I got wrong- I bashed on Tezos very fast thinking they were just another project raising millions and failing to deliver.Dear newbies- Tezos is one of the least spoken projects out there. The founders are focusing on producing value rather than being in the spotlight, and they have been delivering. They have a very sophisticated on chain governance using proof of stake as well as having Jill Carlson and Meltem Demirors as advisors and investors. Finally, they were the first cryptocurrency picked up by Coinbase for its staking as a service model.I feel a lot of people have fallen for this one. I thought I fixed bitcoins problem of all the lost BTCs by ‚Äúswapping‚Äù old tokens into new ones. I got inspired after reading there were 4 million BTCs lost forever already. That's ~$34 Billion when bitcoin is at $9,000!What I got wrong- The very basis that such a thing was possible. The whole purpose of bitcoin is that its uncensorable sound money, meaning if you are no the owner, no one can retrieve it no matter how much money someone lost. I thought because other cryptocurrencies such as EOS and Vechain made swaps, such a solution would be possible.Dear newbies- Bitcoin is the most decentralized and immutable form of currency out there. No one can change the history of the chain, no one. Not even Binance, the biggest exchange who was hacked this year and proposed a re-org later to be defunct.Final note- I don‚Äôt believe in erasing past articles, this is one of the best ways I can learn from my past writings and allow people online to correct me on it. I made mistakes, but they will not stop me from writing even if I make more mistakes in the future. Don't be afraid to express your ideas and thoughts about an industry you don't understand anything about it. Some of the biggest entrepreneurs have succeeded in industries they had a small understanding about. The point is not to be who knows the most, but who can take the most actions, hold accountability, and prepare the world for a better future.",31/05/2019,0,0,10,1,1050,1312,1,0,0,6,84
Is Facebook Listening to Your Private Conversations and Selling That Data to Advertisers?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/is-facebook-listening-to-your-private-conversations-and-selling-that-data-to-advertisers-64d0ab186c74,Scott Beckman,363,3,501,"Why do we sometimes see Facebook ads related to things we were just talking about?According to journalist Tyler Mears, it‚Äôs because Facebook must be listening to our conversations via the microphones on our phones.How else can you possibly explain incidents like the ones she reports here, where she was shown an ad for a feminine urination device the very next day after talking her partner about one, and then again shown an ad for a stab-proof vest after talking to her partner about a stabbing that had happened?Let‚Äôs see if we can think through why Facebook may have put her in an audience for both products, assuming it didn‚Äôt listen to her conversations.First up, the feminine urination device.Who buys feminine urination devices?Women, I‚Äôd guess. Probably young women. If I had to guess their interests, I‚Äôd say camping might be up there ‚Äî that‚Äôs the prime time to use a Shewee or any other feminine urination device.So is it possible that Tyler saw an ad for a Shewee because she‚Äôs a young woman whom Facebook knows to be interested in camping?Of course it is.Next up, the stab-proof vest.Who might be interested in a stab-proof vest?Young woman who like camping? Probably not.So let‚Äôs add a bit more context from Tyler‚Äôs story. She had recently shown her partner a video of a man attempting to stab a police officer, which was an event that had happened recently.Is it possible that Facebook‚Äôs advertisers might choose to show stab-proof vests to people who recently watched stabbing videos and might therefore feel unsafe?Absolutely.The simplest solution is often the right one.Is it possible that Facebook listens in to our conversations and uses what it hears us discuss to provide targeting data to advertisers, even though that would be illegal and they‚Äôve claimed many times that it‚Äôs untrue?Well, of course it is. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.But is it more likely that Tyler, like all of us sometimes do, happened to be targeted with ads for legitimate reasons and just happened to connect the dots to conversations she‚Äôd had?I‚Äôd say it is.The human mind often sees connections where there are none. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a survival technique, that it helps us see camouflaged predators.We also tend to notice things we have some connection to. For example, you might see more Camaros on the road if you recently bought a Camaro. There aren‚Äôt actually more Camaros; you‚Äôre just spotting them now because they‚Äôre on your mind. The same could be true for Tyler; she may have been targeted with the Shewee and stab-proof vest ads many times in the past but had no reason to notice them, so she didn‚Äôt.It also seems like many people want to believe that there are conspiracies, that corporations and governments are constantly hiding things from us and tricking us to do things we wouldn‚Äôt want to do.I‚Äôm certainly not arguing that companies and governments aren‚Äôt doing those things, but it sure makes us seem paranoid when we leap to that conclusion without evidence.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,2,1050,698,4,0,0,9,28

You can accomplish much more if you have a consistent work-rest schedule.You often seek the negative sides of yourself and others. Don‚Äôt be like that. Trust in yourself and open up to other people. Give yourself more credits and certitude. Be confident, independent, but also have faith in those around you. Stop saying things like ‚ÄúI can do it myself‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better off doing it myself.‚Äù Don‚Äôt rely on people for your happiness, but ask for help when you need to.Things like what to do after college, or how you will survive your first years of official adulthood.

The Cellular Space Race is Leaving Rural America Behind,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-cellular-space-race-is-leaving-rural-america-behind-a6057f22467e,Alexander Matthews,441,3,512,"It was a flat tire that really laid bare the challenges besetting cellular phone coverage in the US.Luckily we got to a gas station before the nail we‚Äôd driven over had truly deflated it. We were in the town of Lake Placid, NY, not far from its center, opposite a diner and near a big market. My partner, who uses AT&T, called his insurance on his cell. Before managing to finalize towing to the nearest tire dealer, the call cut. He had no service now. When a bar or two of signal returned, he tried again. The call cut once more: no service (and this time, it didn‚Äôt come back). So he went into the gas station‚Äôs store to see if they had a phone he could use.And that‚Äôs when it hit me. There‚Äôs so much hype about 5G ‚Äî the lightning fast speeds and capacity that will transform the way we live, work, trade and consume entertainment. And yet here we were, in the middle of a town that‚Äôs twice hosted the Winter Olympics, forced to seek out a landline because of a lack of signal service.Ironically, I actually had a bar, sometimes two, (sometimes LTE, but mostly edge). I say this was ironic because I was on T-mobile ‚Äî a big mistake. I‚Äôd been seduced by the seemingly impressive and expansive coverage map I‚Äôd seen on its website and the reasonable ($40) monthly package for tourists when I‚Äôd bought a SIM in NYC a few weeks before. I should have taken the meagre bars of signal in Manhattan as an omen for what was to occur in Vermont, though.Of course I was expecting lengthy stretches of lonely road through forest to be signal-less. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was for there to be ‚ÄúNo Service‚Äù on the top lefthand corner of my iPhone in several towns ‚Äî even Brattleboro, where only around the Co-op did I manage to get some, finally.There were some areas of Vermont where T-Mobile passed the baton to AT&T, and I received the latter‚Äôs service. But in spite of it claiming to be 4G, browsing was glacially near-dial-up kinda slow. This wasn‚Äôt surprising: I would imagine that serving its rival‚Äôs customers with super fast internet is not a priority for AT&T. That‚Äôs fine if, like me, you‚Äôre a tourist on a road trip (assuming you don‚Äôt get a flat!). But if you live in these parts, it must be darn frustrating.I‚Äôm all for innovation, and for the possibilities that 5G can bring for business and daily life. But as we inch towards its implementation, let‚Äôs not forget that, outside of big cities, there is still serious work that needs to be done to ensure reliable but more basic coverage. Invest in 5G infrastructure and the development of 5G-compatible phones all you want, but also pay attention to the rural areas (and towns!) that appear to have been left behind.

Once the diagnosis is made, there can be relief (phew, I finally know what‚Äôs going on), sadness, grief, anger and a mix of many other emotions.A diagnosis also can change how people see you. You go from being a person with interests, fears, aspirations to being the diagnosis or label.In the advocacy work I do, I spend a lot of time talking about the need for going beyond the diagnosis. While the diagnosis is important to accessing care, and in some cases funding, it can also put people in boxes based on their condition.While 10 people may have the same diagnosis, it will present differently in each person. It is this uniqueness and individuality that needs to be highlighted to ensure you or your loved one receives the care they need versus a cookie cutter approach.As a parent of a child with special needs, I spend a lot of time explaining who my child is as a person. I talk about his personality, his likes, dislikes, his previous medical experiences (no you aren‚Äôt the only doctor he will see this month), and how best to interact with him.I‚Äôve learned from experience, providing insights into my child as a person, not just a label, has transformed many of our appointments. It reminds people to adjust how they interact with him to meet his needs, not their own.For example, prior to a recent procedure, I talked with the medical team about the importance of giving my son choices. If you need to take his temperature, ask him if he wants it under his arm or in his mouth. Same goes with the oxygen monitor ‚Äî let him choose if he wants it on his finger or his toe.By giving my son choices, he gains some control of the situation. And it takes away some of the stress and anxiety for everyone. It also reminded the team they were dealing with a young child who is scared and overwhelmed, so be patient and go slow.When we let highlight the person, not the patient, it helps in all areas of care.Healthcare professionals and educators carry high workloads, and often aren‚Äôt able to take the time to get to know every person. They quickly scan a person‚Äôs record to see their lab results, diagnosis and treatment plan. While this may tell them a lot about the diagnosis, it likely contains little to no information about the person sitting in front of them as an individual.I‚Äôm not saying you take your healthcare provider out for dinner and tell them your life story. Rather, it‚Äôs about spending 1‚Äì2 minutes talking about the person. If you‚Äôre the patient, let them know what worries you, how you react to procedures, what you are like going beyond the diagnosis.Going back to my son, I always explain that he‚Äôs a quiet child whose super power is to not answer questions (as it‚Äôs one aspect of appointments he can control). Why is this important? So they realize he does understand what they are saying, but chooses to not respond. This is key to helping them realize he doesn‚Äôt not have mental delays (which is often assumed) but rather is taking control in his own way.I urge you to also take control. Pull back the curtains and let people see the person, not just the diagnosis. If you‚Äôre scared or nervous, say so. If you want to have choices, let them know. Shine the light on who you are as a person to ensure the care you receive meets your needs, as much as is possible.And if you really want a personal connection, take a moment to learn a bit about the person talking to you. By connecting as people we can slowly tear down the wall between patients and healthcare professionals.This story has also appeared as a blog post on Learn Patient Advocacy.",30/05/2019,1,0,0,0,640,427,1,0,0,1,105
Smashing Through Creative Blocks,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/smashing-through-creative-blocks-a7af56fdfa35,Leanne Johnson,114,3,575,"Whether you‚Äôre stuck on a current project or you‚Äôve been away from creative passion for a while, creative blocks suck. A little perseverance and these suggestions might help you get back into the swing of it.The first step to smashing any creative block should be understanding why you‚Äôre blocked.Are you unsure what happens next to your characters? Are you feeling overwhelmed and too busy to paint? Are you not confident enough in your abilities?When you identify why you‚Äôre feeling blocked, you can start to put together the best plan of attack for smashing through that wall.Challenge yourself to create something every day. Better yet, find an accountability partner and check in with each other.Try writing a poem every day. Or sketching something around your home. It doesn‚Äôt have to be something big and it doesn‚Äôt have to take long. Heck, it doesn‚Äôt even have to be part of a work in progress.Just create something.Instead of saying you have to create something every day, tell yourself you want to.By changing the language used about your creativity in this way, it becomes less of a chore and more of a desire. At the risk of sounding too new-agey, our self-talk really changes the way we think and feel about things.Lock that meanie up; they have no place here.Something that‚Äôs worked for me is a Critic Jar. I took an old pickle jar and covered it in paper so I can‚Äôt see inside. Whenever my inner critic starts whispering how bad my writing is, how I‚Äôll never be successful, I write those thoughts on a little piece of paper and put it in the jar.There‚Äôs something about physically locking that thought away in the jar that takes it right out of my mind‚Äîat least for the time being.Studies show that the human brain is most creative when it‚Äôs closest to sleep. I think that‚Äôs why we get flashes of brilliance when we‚Äôre trying to fall asleep.If you can, try getting up a little earlier each morning, even half an hour, and creating before work. Or, stay up a little later and create before bed.In spite of not being a morning person, I find I‚Äôm most creative first thing in the morning. I‚Äôm not consistently successful, but there‚Äôs something satisfying about prioritizing my creativity.This is a huge one!We‚Äôre bombarded with stuff. TV! Internet! Smartphones! We‚Äôre never bored anymore. I can‚Äôt even watch a 1-hour tv show without playing on my phone.Write by hand, leave your phone in the other room. Go for a walk in nature, without Pokemon Go.Unplug, get bored, and give your mind some time to wander.Clearly tied to creating every day, but the most important thing you can do to bust through your block is to show up.I don‚Äôt believe in ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù. I believe that we get our best ideas when we‚Äôre showing up and doing the work. The muse can‚Äôt catch you if you don‚Äôt have your butt in the chair.My last piece of advice for you is this: Don‚Äôt be afraid to fail.This is another one I struggle with. I‚Äôve always been terrified to put myself out there, to let my writing stand for me, because I‚Äôm afraid of what people will think. Seriously, I have the worst case of Imposter Syndrome.I‚Äôve seen this fear hold so many people back from creating and it breaks my heart a little. You deserve to be creative, to make beautiful things, and share them with others. ‚ù§",31/05/2019,0,0,2,2,1050,700,1,0,0,2,75
Why Comparing Yourself Gets You Nowhere,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/define-success-ff88f05face5,Ashley Rose,1500,4,796,"I‚Äôve grown up comparing myself to others.I ‚Äòve compared myself to friends who had all the ‚Äòin‚Äô clothes and accessories and I‚Äôd be wearing store-brand trainers and rocking my cousin‚Äôs old Adidas jumper.I‚Äôve compared my body to celebrities. The celebrities who have fitness instructors, plastic surgery and photoshop. Crazy I know!I‚Äôve compared my lifestyle to those around me, my income, my outgoings.‚ÄòI know I earn more than _______ how can they afford a holiday and a fancy car‚ÄôI compare myself to other writers. How do they find the time? Look at how many followers they have! Look how much money they‚Äôre making, working from home, why can‚Äôt I do that?‚ÄòWhy is her baby sleeping through the night and mine is still up every hour??‚ÄôThe list is endless. I know I can‚Äôt be the only one.It doesn‚Äôt matter what age you are or what life experience you have we are all guilty of believing the grass is greener.Greener grass?You look over to your neighbors‚Äô garden; you see luscious, thick, perfectly mowed grass , the roses are trimmed, and the tulips are evenly spread. Your grass is a week or so past overgrown, daisy‚Äôs scattered, not a rose in sight and those pesky yellow things have popped up.You can‚Äôt help but compare the under-loved garden to the immaculate spectacle next door.While you haven‚Äôt touched your garden, your neighbor has set his alarm early to sprinkle his grass with feed, he has his water sprinkler set to optimum timing with the sun so it doesn‚Äôt become burnt, he has studied roses and the art of pruning and growing roses for the last 10 years. It matters to him.You look at your garden and think it should be just as beautiful or better.But why?You are comparing your starter project to his well-loved, tended project. Your neighbor has been at his garden for years. Why should your results be better?You are just starting to weed out.There can be no comparison.You are both at such different stages of the game.It‚Äôs unfair to you.Why are you being unfair on you? What could you possibly gain from the comparison?Where would you be better focusing this energy? Maybe ask your neighbor for advice, he may not part with all his gardening tips but sure would set you in the right direction!Moving on from the garden analogy, this thought process can be applied to almost any comparison trap you find yourself in:The mom at school who has all her sh*t together with 4 kids, gym time, yoga instructor body, perfect make-up at 0830 while you have half run, half dragged your kid to school, he has toothpaste up his face, his snack is a squashed PBJ, your attempt at chic messy bun is just plain messy and to top off you find Weetabix smashed down the front of your t-shirt.The grass is not greener. It might be better tended or more organized but never greener.It is impossible to compare your messy middle to anything apart from where you started, and if you have a messy middle it must mean you have made progress!Well done you!You and I define success differently. I can‚Äôt tell you what success will look like or feel like for you.Success might be making it out of bed in the morning, brewing a strong coffee and enjoying it. Woo Hoo ‚Äî I succeeded!(I do try and set the bar a little higher than this though!)Is success a warm fuzzy feeling?Finishing a task?Achieving a lifelong goal?Money in the bank?Is it all the above?For me, success has 2 levels. I think about my long-term larger goal and then break this down into small achievable steps. Completing each smaller step is a success, getting the final hurdle of the big goal is a celebratory success!A couple of my examplesBig goal: submit a final draft manuscript to an agent/ get ready for self-publish (not yet decided which path to choose)Break it down:Big goal: cut down on waste, chemicals, and additives (this is a big one and could go on and on so the small successes are key)Break it down:These are all mini successes. If I think of only the bigger goal, I become overwhelmed with how big and unachievable it is. Each step towards it must be a success.When you look back at your mini successes you can feel achievement, you can compare it to how or where you were yesterday, last week or even last year. This healthy comparison will boost you! And if you look back and think I haven‚Äôt changed, then it is an encouragement to do so!Once you have sat down, gained clarity on your big goals and the little successes to get there, you will have no need to compare to anyone else.Define your success. Target your success, achieve your success!Get happy!",30/05/2019,1,0,9,1,1050,908,1,2,0,2,200
The IT Utility Trap,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-it-utility-trap-27c2c701c8a3,Daniel Jacobsohn,16,3,654,"‚ÄúThere are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don‚Äôt‚Äù-010000010110111001101111011011100111100101101101011011110111010101110011You‚Äôre in charge of an IT organization. Your employees and customers have high expectations for your group, and you want to deliver on all fronts. You want your people to keep up with the state of the art, provide secure and stable systems, and meet your customers‚Äô needs.You‚Äôve got a reasonable budget, awesome employees, and you stay on top of all the trends. So what‚Äôs keeping you up at night? Do you feel like your group is doing everything it can to help the organization reach its goals? How do you know? And how would you even make all of that a priority when there‚Äôs already a mountain of work? Besides, weren‚Äôt you hired to make sure your technology stack runs seamlessly so other people can get their work done?Digital technologies are so important to our lives that you‚Äôre expected to be something more than a utility. Your public dashboard for service up-time is great, but your customers don‚Äôt really care about it until one of the boxes shows anything but green. So, naturally, you invest in the best data center space. You use excellent virtualization tools and a hybridized backup suite. Everyone in the organization is cross trained on multiple technologies so you don‚Äôt even have a possible human single point of failure. You buy high quality end user machines with the best endpoint management. Your redundancies have redundancies. It‚Äôs turtles all the way down...Only problem is, where‚Äôs your time and money for organizational and technological innovation? It‚Äôs all been consumed by your pursuit of up-time. So now you‚Äôre seen as a utility service ‚Äî one with a fixed budget and ever-expanding customer expectations. In addition, the more an organization standardizes, the more it is seen as a prime target for outsourcing/offshoring/shared-servicing/whatever-the-new-euphemism-is-for-your-job-is-going-somewhere-else.But you‚Äôre in technology for more than making sure the bits flow when someone opens the virtual tap. You‚Äôve been trained in strategic planning and leadership, and you see ways your team could contribute in more significant ways to the organizational mission.So you have lunch with your CFO and tell her you want to be seen as a strategic resource for the organization. She looks at you like you‚Äôve grown a second head. She groks how human talent and money advance the organization, but you just said that something that fades into the background (unless it‚Äôs broken) can help her meet goals. You finish lunch and go back to the office and pull up the organization‚Äôs mission, vision, and strategic plan. ‚ÄúUsing the most advanced backup technologies‚Äù isn‚Äôt one of the goals. Neither is ‚ÄúFinding the optimal development environment for our programmers‚Äù. Huh‚Ä¶So what‚Äôs one to do? Have more lunches with the important people in your organization. They‚Äôre not necessarily the ones with the CxO titles, but they are the ones that can get things done and know how things really work. Tell them you want to make sure your IT group is doing everything it can to support their needs. Further, you‚Äôd like to hear what kinds of processes they dream about implementing, but there‚Äôs just never enough time or resources. Thank them for their time and ask for another meeting in a couple weeks.Go back to your team and discuss how technology can help make those dreams reality. Investigate how your ideas fit into the overall goals and vision for the organization. Put a weekly meeting on the calendar to bring new challenges and ideas you glean from your lunch discussions. Maybe it‚Äôs a new Friday afternoon (aka The Land That Productivity Forgot) ritual.When you have critical mass on these projects and ideas, wrap them up into your budget and planning process, and see what happens. Maybe your CTO will start seeing you and your people in a more strategic light. And that‚Äôs usually a really good thing when budget cuts are handed out.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,1,1050,699,2,0,0,4,2

Publish All Your Writing ‚Äî Good or Bad,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/publish-all-your-writing-good-or-bad-65a92750dcfc,Lance Luther,165,3,402,"If you‚Äôre reading this, chances are that you‚Äôre a writer. And as with all writers, you‚Äôve probably written some terrible stuff. Perhaps you‚Äôve used too many cliches, or maybe the topic you were writing about didn‚Äôt actually interest you but you decided to write about it because it was ‚Äúpopular‚Äù and you thought it would gain you traction. Maybe it was your first article (my first piece on Medium sucked too, you‚Äôre not alone) or maybe you‚Äôve hit a dead patch. Whatever the reason is, you should publish it.When you put your work out there, it gives people a chance to read it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs not so much the expectation that someone will read it, but rather the idea that someone could. The mentality of somebody potentially reading what you write challenges you psychologically to write better, to proofread more critically, and to come up with better ideas. And when you publish poor writing and nobody reads it, it gives you an opportunity to see where you went wrong. It allows you to find what people like and don‚Äôt like. From here, you take lessons from your hits and your misses and tailor that to write better and to find that sweet spot where you maintain your own writing style and write things that people want to read.Furthermore, it‚Äôs not a sin to write short ‚Äî to have a higher quality piece is far more important than droning on and on. Nobody wants to hear your life story if it‚Äôs not relevant to the topic you advertise in the title/subtitle. So skip the irrelevant stuff, which will help you keep on track and ensure that your article is more concise. It‚Äôs usually the concise pieces that are considered better and it also saves you time!So the next time you write something, write with the intention in mind that you are going to publish it and that others have the opportunity to read it. Pitch it to a few publications and if that doesn‚Äôt work out, then just publish it directly to Medium. The key to getting better at writing is to practice writing and learning what what works or what doesn‚Äôt. By putting out all your work, good or bad, you get that valuable feedback through the Views:Reads ratio, whether publications or curators pick it up, and that constructively critical comment every once in a while.Best of luck on your writing endeavors.-Lwritingcooperative.comwritingcooperative.com",30/05/2019,12,0,2,2,1050,416,2,0,0,6,1600

Key Findings From The Infinite Dial 2019 Report,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/key-findings-from-the-infinite-dial-2019-report-baba60bb088f,Amy Woods,53,6,1027,"We can learn a lot about current trends and user behavior on social media by looking at the data uncovered by Edison Research and Triton Digital‚Äôs Infinite Dial 2019 report.On episode 84 of the podcast, ‚Äú Podcast Repurposing Has Never Been More Important ,‚Äù I shared insights from Edison Research‚Äôs Podcast Consumer Report 2019. We dug deep into the report and divulged lots of interesting insights into the ever-growing popularity of podcasts and why repurposing them is so important. ‚ÄãIn this blog post, I take a closer look at The Infinite Dial 2019. This is the longest running survey of digital media consumer behavior in America. It‚Äôs based on a national telephone survey of 1500 people over the age of 12 in the USA.‚ÄãParticipants of the survey are chosen at random. And, the study covers the length and breadth of digital media from podcasting to social media, smart speakers and more.I‚Äôll admit‚Ä¶every time the latest Infinite Dial Report comes out, I get super excited! Because as a content creator, I‚Äôm able to use key findings from the report to help me (and my clients) review our own social media and digital content strategies. The results from the report can help you identify what platforms to focus on and perhaps more importantly, where to focus your repurposing efforts. ‚ÄãAfter all, I always say that you need to make sure you create content for the platforms your audience is on. There‚Äôs no point posting content whenever and wherever. While trial and error is important, studies like this can be a huge eye opener. Digital trends change fast.I dive into some of the key findings from this year‚Äôs report and look at how this information can be useful when it comes to strategizing and planning our own content marketing tactics.As it currently stands, a staggering 79% of Americans age 12+ say they have used social media. That‚Äôs estimated to be 223m people!Obviously, that is a lot of people.Perhaps even more interesting though is the fact that this number grew considerably between 2008 and 2016, which is hardly surprising since social media has well and truly taken over our lives!Let‚Äôs face it, when we wake up, one of the first things most of us do is check our social media accounts. When we go to bed, quite often one of the last things we do is check social media. And, let‚Äôs not even think too much about how many hours we spend during the day on social media. This is something I‚Äôm personally trying to crack down on! ‚ÄãThe report shows that since the spike in 2016, social media usage has leveled off considerably.The number of people using social media is no longer on a steep upward trajectory with the average percentage ranging between 77 % to 80% over the last four years.Looking at the Infinite Dial Report 2019, I‚Äôll admit that there aren‚Äôt any ground-breaking revelations or surprises in terms of brand awareness of the social media platforms.Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are the top three (no surprises there). But that‚Äôs awareness. Usage is a little different‚Ä¶On a side note‚Ä¶was it just me or is anyone else surprised to see Pinterest included in the results?I would consider Pinterest to be a search engine vs social media platform. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs useful to get that data. WhatsApp is another newbie to be included in the survey‚Ä¶not really social media either but still interesting to find out how many people use it and who.The biggest decline in usage was Facebook from 67% to 61%.Although they still have plenty of users at an estimated 172m, they‚Äôve lost 15m users in just two years.So, is this the sign of Facebook being on the decline?That‚Äôs still A LOT of people using it! I guess time will tell whether Facebook will continue to decline or miraculously turn this around. What‚Äôs really interesting though is the revelation that the majority of Facebook users who don‚Äôt use the platform as much are 12 to 34 year old‚Äôs.As younger generations continue to leave, users age 55+ are on the rise. Younger people are more split between Facebook and Instagram.If you ask me, the reason behind the decline in younger users is a classic ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to hang out where my parents are (or even grandparents) !!The Infinite Dial Report also looks at media and technology.Smart speaker awareness is on the up and it looks like more people than ever are purchasing them and using them in their homes. According to the research, 23% of the U.S. population over 12 years of age own a smart speaker. That‚Äôs an estimated 65m people!Amazon Alexa still dominates over Google Home as the most popular smart speaker device manufacturer. ‚ÄãWith the popularity of smart speakers on the rise, it‚Äôs good to start thinking about ways to get in front of your audience on this growing medium.Have a listen to episode 69 of our podcast, ‚Äú How to Repurpose a Podcast into an Alexa Flash Briefing with Sigrun ,‚Äù ‚Äã for tips on how to repurpose your content for smart speakers.It‚Äôs clear from the Infinite Dial Report that you can bet your bottom dollar that there are literally millions of people on social media. Even the lesser represented platforms your audience are on social media sill have a magnitude of users. If you want to reach the right people, you have to know your niche. You also have to know where your audience are hanging out online.If your content is aimed at a younger audience you probably shouldn‚Äôt put all of your efforts into Facebook since it‚Äôs mainly catering to an older audience.Instagram and LinkedIn are two platforms on the rise. Check my interview with Sam Rathling ‚Äã for lots of great tips and insights on LinkedIn.The results also show that audio consumption is on the rise too. Time to start a podcast? Time to create daily flash briefings on Alexa? How can you create audio content?If you‚Äôre trying to reach people online it‚Äôs worth paying attention to the key findings from this report as it‚Äôs all relevant, up-to-date and useful.Say Hello on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and LinkedIn.Originally published at https://www.content10x.com.",30/05/2019,0,0,2,4,986,501,4,3,0,13,15
Keeping a ‚Äúcool head‚Äù about Amazon in Virginia,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/keeping-a-cool-head-about-amazon-in-virginia-140c95e40677,Spencer Shanholtz,1,7,1445,"After a lengthy and high-profile crusade, Amazon has chosen to split its second headquarters (HQ2) between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens in New York City and Crystal City (rebranded as ‚ÄúNational Landing‚Äù) in Arlington, Virginia. The Seattle-based Amazon could get more than $2 billion in tax breaks and other incentives as part of the deal to open up two new offices with more than 25,000 new jobs at each location. As one of the largest economic development investments in U.S. history, this is a spectacular deal for Virginia ‚Äî promising $2.5 billion in capital investments and $3.2 billion in net tax revenue over 20 years, plus thousands of jobs with an average pay of $150,000. However, many are predicting an outsized effect (both positive and negative) on regional economics, housing markets, and infrastructure. There are multiple reasons why Amazon‚Äôs impact on the Commonwealth and the Washington region may not be as extravagant as many are prognosticating.DetailsFirst, let‚Äôs look a little closer at the details and see why Virginia acquired a comparatively fantastic deal. Virginia is providing Amazon with performance-based direct incentives of $573 million based on 25,000 jobs created with an average wage of over $150,000. While this is considerable, all the incentives Amazon receives are contingent on job creation over the coming years. Virginia structured the deal to ensure that it is cash-flow positive for the state budget. Virginia makes the first incentive payment five years from now ‚Äî long after Amazon begins hiring and generating tax revenue. By comparison, New York is delivering nearly three times what Virginia offered ‚Äî $1.525 billion ‚Äî for a similar commitment to investment in new jobs. This is still a fraction of what other states unsuccessfully offered ‚Äî Maryland and New Jersey put forward $8.5 billion and $7 billion, respectively.So, why Virginia? Most of Virginia‚Äôs pitch wasn‚Äôt by way of grants or tax credits but was through promised investments in infrastructure and education that will be around even if Amazon disappeared tomorrow. Virginia will spend up to $295 million on transportation projects, including upgrades to the Metro system and a connector bridge from Crystal City to National Airport. Virginia also paired its incentive deal with an announcement to spend up to $1.1 billion over 20 years to expand technical education at the state‚Äôs community colleges and universities. This includes construction of a nearly $1 billion Virginia Tech graduate campus focused on innovation, which will be built near the new Amazon headquarters and will provide hundreds of qualified high-tech workers annually. Many of these investments were already in the pipeline, or the state was committed to making them with or without Amazon.Existing talent and Virginia‚Äôs willingness to invest in future talent were the most important drivers in Amazon‚Äôs choice of Arlington. Both Virginia and Amazon said the qualities that make Arlington an ideal location for HQ2 were in place before the agreement: the availability of a highly educated workforce, a diverse population, vibrant city life, and good public transportation. These factors are all likely to attract the young, upscale tech professionals who are Amazon‚Äôs most valuable resource. In other words, Amazon needed Arlington more than Arlington needed Amazon.No Need to Overstate the Impacts:Economic ImpactsThe Amazon entry to the regional and state economy may be noteworthy, but its immediate impact is relatively insignificant in context. According to a memorandum of understanding, Amazon expects to hire 400 people in 2019 and 1,180 in 2020. By 2030, it expects to create a minimum of 25,000 jobs and potentially a total of 37,850 by 2034, which is the equivalent of about three-quarters of a percentage point of all jobs in the Washington Metropolitan region. In recent years, the Washington region grew by about 50,000 jobs annually, which is equivalent to about two Amazons, according to numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The gradual hiring by Amazon ensures that the Washington region won‚Äôt see a large shock to its labor market.Source: VEDP analysis, Moody‚Äôs AnalyticsRegardless of Amazon‚Äôs entry, the region is on track to continue growing. According to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a projected 1.5 million people will move to the area by 2045, an estimate conceived long before Amazon‚Äôs search began. In addition, Arlington already has one of the most tech talented workforces in the U.S. and many of Amazon‚Äôs new workers will be hired from that pool of talent instead of from outside the region. HQ2 will still likely intensify population growth over time, but the gradual nature of the growth and advance notice will ideally allow for additional infrastructure investments to mitigate adverse effects.Infrastructure ImpactsUndeniably, the addition of such a large company with thousands of workers to a small area such as Crystal City (aka National Landing) will cause some traffic headaches. However, these neighborhoods and the region overall are likely to struggle with this issue, regardless of Amazon.The state, Arlington County, and the City of Alexandria will spend hundreds of millions of dollars building out transportation infrastructure serving the area. Many of these improvements were already included in long-range plans, now serving Amazon‚Äôs needs but also benefiting the Arlington community. The Amazon deal may also serve as a catalyst to get the projects done sooner. Coinciding with the type of campus and workforce that Amazon attracts, Arlington projects that 77% of Amazon‚Äôs workers will walk, bike, car-share or take mass transit to work. Commuter traffic further out from Arlington where infrastructure improvements are not a part of the deal, may not increase much relatively due to these expected commuting patterns.Source: VEDP analysis, Seattle (2017 Center City Commuter Mode Split Survey Results); NOVA includes Herndon, McNair, Alexandria, and Arlington (ACS, 2012‚Äì2016); Arlington estimates are from the county plannerHousing ImpactsFor years, the Northern Virginia region has been plagued by a low housing supply, rapid price appreciation, and a highly competitive market. Arlington‚Äôs median home values reached $542,500 in October of this year. There are substantiated concerns that the housing affordability challenges faced by many low- and moderate- income residents will only be worsened by Amazon‚Äôs arrival. While an influx of highly paid tech workers will certainly have some effect on the housing market, Amazon‚Äôs impact will be gradual and over time, rather than immediate.However, one change that is expected to happen immediately is an increase in renting as people become acquainted with the area. A year or so later, there will likely be greater demand for home purchasing and continued upward pricing pressures. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) projects that the average rent in 2026 will be between $2,216 and $2,233 per month. Amazon is expected to add less than $110 to that monthly number. Local officials reported that the area could see a short-term increase of 4 to 6 percent in the housing rental market ‚Äî similar to what it has experienced in recent years.Source: VEDP analysis, Zillow, Apartment List, CoStarOthers have alluded to the extreme housing impacts that Amazon and other tech companies have had on Seattle and are concerned that the community that houses the new headquarters will suffer similar impacts. However, the Washington region housing market is much larger and robust and is expanding rapidly with expected increases in property values even without Amazon ‚Äî dissimilar from Seattle‚Äôs situation.The lack of affordable housing is a problem that existed before Amazon‚Äôs announcement and both Arlington and Alexandria have made affordable and workforce housing a priority in the past. Amazon‚Äôs expansion will likely serve as a catalyst for continued investment. For example, the two localities have committed to allocating a portion of the new revenue from Amazon to affordable housing projects ‚Äî enough to support the development of more than 1,000 affordable units.Another step that local governments can take to help mitigate the expected price increases over the next decade is to allow for denser development in certain corridors. One of the things that makes housing so expensive in the region is opposition to zoning and ordinance changes that would allow for more housing units to become available in certain key areas.ConclusionAmazon‚Äôs selection for its second headquarters underscores how Northern Virginia has distinguished itself as not solely a federal government accessory, but a technology capital.In choosing such large, developed metropolitan regions, the company ultimately chose the places that could absorb Amazon easily, not the places Amazon could reinvent or rejuvenate. Virginia is getting a cash-flow positive deal with high paying jobs, new tax revenue, and a renewed brand as technology capital. The courtship has also initiated a large investment in higher education and transit improvements that will serve the community well regardless of whether Amazon is headquartered there or not. Amazon made a good business decision and Virginia got a good deal.",30/05/2019,0,0,1,8,864,473,5,0,0,17,1
The clarifying power of writing and storytelling,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/the-clarifying-power-of-writing-and-storytelling-48efef2c6256,Adam M. Lowenstein,601,11,2533,"One night in the spring of 1874, two years into his second term in the White House, Ulysses S. Grant was stuck. As historian Ron Chernow recounts in his biography of America‚Äôs eighteenth president, Grant was struggling to decide whether to sign a bill to boost the amount of paper currency in circulation to combat an economic downturn. He was wary of the bill‚Äôs consequences but under enormous political pressure to sign it.After a sleepless night, he met with his cabinet to announce his decision. ‚ÄúThe night before,‚Äù as Chernow describes it, Grant ‚Äúhad resolved to sign the inflation bill and sat up late drafting an accompanying message, listing his most cogent arguments. But the more he wrote, he said, the more specious his own arguments sounded.‚Äù All night, Grant continued to put pen to paper, exploring the best arguments he could muster for and against the bill. Chernow captures the scene: ‚ÄúThe more he wrote that night, the less he was persuaded by his own reasoning. Finally, he thought, ‚ÄòWhat is the good of all this? You do not believe it. You know it is not true.‚Äô‚ÄùSo, Grant signed the bill anyway, right? He‚Äôd already invested time and energy into getting it passed. He certainly had a lot of people expecting he‚Äôd sign it. He was under significant pressure, and he had plenty of other tasks on his to-do list, like trying to hold together a nation reeling from a bloody civil war. It would‚Äôve been far easier just to sign the bill and move on. But he didn‚Äôt. Instead, Chernow writes, ‚Äúhe tore up his message, tossed it into the wastebasket, and decided to veto the bill.‚ÄùGrant lived an epic life. Why highlight this one seemingly insignificant moment? Why focus on a brief anecdote that commands only a couple of the thousand-plus pages Chernow gives him? In part because, as Chernow writes, it was ‚Äúan impressive display of Grant‚Äôs intellectual honesty, candor, and exemplary courage.‚Äù But it‚Äôs more than that, at least in one particular way. In this anecdote, we see Grant consciously make time to think deeply about a single challenging issue. We see him reflect on it before acting. We see him consider his own biases and inclinations. We see him explore his own values and beliefs.I‚Äôm projecting a lot of thoughts on Grant here. No one knows exactly what he was thinking that night. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone making such a difficult and contentious decision without a process of deep reflection and keen sense of self-awareness ‚Äî a process enabled and accelerated by the simple act of writing. It was through writing that Grant discovered what he truly felt about the bill on his desk. It was through writing that Grant found the clarity to make the decision that best aligned with his values. It was through writing that Grant figured out what he truly thought and believed.These days, as notifications and requests bombard our screens and inboxes, and as information, distractions, and stimuli assault our brains, the peace of mind Grant found that night feels ever more elusive. Think about the last time you needed to work through something challenging ‚Äî preparing for a difficult conversation with a friend, say, or making a choice about the next step in your career. Did you work through it carefully and methodically? Or, like me, did you fit it into a few spare minutes between meetings and emails and other short-term obligations? When was the last time any of us found the mental stillness to explore an idea or arrive clearly and confidently at a decision?There are plenty of techniques for building awareness and creating space to think. At a practical level, for instance, we might turn off notifications on our phones or build a meditation practice or schedule a recurring calendar event for ‚ÄúTime to think.‚Äù More philosophically, we could try to tackle the compulsion that so many of us feel to be busy and stressed all the time, or we might make a concerted effort to fight FOMO ‚Äî the notorious ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù ‚Äî that infects so much of how we spend our time. If mental clarity is what we‚Äôre after, though, perhaps we might consider a more old-school approach to making sense of things: writing.One of Grant‚Äôs predecessors, Abraham Lincoln, took to heart not just the power of the written word, but the power of actually writing the words. As Joshua Wolf Shenk recounts in Lincoln‚Äôs Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness, while the sixteenth president ‚Äúoften spoke extemporaneously over the course of his career, most of the great works of his mature years were composed on the page. Going through many drafts, he worked out his thoughts by writing and rewriting.‚ÄùTa-Nehisi Coates‚Äô We Were Eight Years In Power: An American Tragedy is a powerful collection of essays on race and politics written throughout the Obama administration. But it‚Äôs also a moving chronicle of his own growth as a writer. In the book, Coates describes how he views writing as a way of understanding and communicating with the world. ‚ÄúWriting is always some form of interpretation,‚Äù he observes, ‚Äúsome form of translating the specificity of one‚Äôs roots or expertise or even one‚Äôs own mind into language that can be absorbed and assimilated into the consciousness of a broader audience.‚ÄùWriting can be many things, from a mechanism to influence public opinion to a way to earn a living to, as Coates puts it, a technique to transmit personal experience into the public discourse. In these instances, writing is a means to an end. But sometimes the act of writing is both the means and the end itself. Sometimes it‚Äôs just a tool to make sense of the thoughts and ideas bouncing around in our brains. A tool to process the endless complexities of life. To bring some order to our questions and doubts, anxieties and inclinations, by distilling them on the page. Writing, as Daniel H. Pink writes (of course) in When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, ‚Äúis an act of discovering what you think and what you believe.‚Äù Writing empowers us to transform mental fragments into coherent philosophies, and to communicate them to ourselves and the world.In an age when typing more than a text message or tweet can seem daunting, it‚Äôs easy to forgot how fulfilling ‚Äî or simply relieving ‚Äî it can be to transfer what‚Äôs in here (the mind) to out there (the page in front of us). It‚Äôs liberating to finally articulate on paper the fleeting strands of a thought or notion that has been ricocheting around one‚Äôs head, consciously or not, for who knows how long. ‚ÄúWrite a bit, just for yourself,‚Äù urges Lin-Manuel Miranda in his tweet-inspired book, Gmorning, Gnight!: Little Pep Talks for Me & You. ‚ÄúGive that maelstrom in your head a place to land. Look @ everything swirling around in there!‚ÄùWhen it comes to processing the world, reading ‚Äî and consuming content generally ‚Äî can be just as liberating. I‚Äôm convinced that one of the most magical moments a person can experience is to encounter writing, whether a single sentence or an entire book, that captures something we‚Äôve been thinking or feeling but haven‚Äôt quite been able to articulate. Like the act of writing itself, finding the right piece of content at the right time doesn‚Äôt just convey information. It also brings clarity to the world and offers us a better understanding of how we fit in it.In his White House memoir, The World As It Is, President Obama‚Äôs longtime aide Ben Rhodes recounts a conversation he had with the then-president about the power of storytelling. In May of 2016, as the president‚Äôs motorcade traveled through Hanoi, Vietnam, Obama urged Rhodes not to shy away from using stories to make the case for the administration‚Äôs policies and decisions. ‚ÄúThe notion that there‚Äôs something wrong with storytelling ‚Äî I mean, that‚Äôs our job,‚Äù Obama told him. ‚ÄúTo tell a really good story about who we are.‚ÄùObama‚Äôs comment gets at the essence of human evolution. In Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, the historian and author Yuval Noah Harari argues that what sets human beings apart from other species, and what has enabled us to build the societies and civilizations we know today, is our ability to cooperate with each other. Key to that cooperation is storytelling. In Harari‚Äôs telling, money is a story. Religion is a story. Nations are stories. Race is a story. These are all socially-constructed concepts that, at their worst, manufacture divisions, hierarchies, and combustible notions of ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem.‚Äù At their best, though, shared values and ideas give our communities structure and enable us to build complex societies greater than the sum of their parts. Stories teach us about each other ‚Äî and ourselves.Today, we have countless ways to share information and exchange ideas. But for most of human history, there was just one: storytelling. In Sapiens, Harari describes the Sumerians, an ancient Mesopotamian people who, sometime around 3,500 B.C., developed a new way to communicate with each other. In doing so, Harari writes, the Sumerians ‚Äúreleased their social order from the limitations of the human brain, opening the way for the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires.‚Äù What was this secret for unlocking mass cooperation? ‚ÄúThe data-processing system invented by the Sumerians,‚Äù Harari explains, ‚Äúis called ‚Äòwriting,‚Äô‚Äù and more than five millennia later, we‚Äôre still using it. ‚ÄúWith the appearance of writing,‚Äù Harari communicates to readers using the Sumerians‚Äô invention, we start ‚Äúto hear history through the ears of its protagonists.‚ÄùThe historian Joseph J. Ellis puts it well in the preface to his recent book, American Dialogue: The Founders and Us. ‚ÄúReading history,‚Äù Ellis writes, ‚Äúis like expanding your memory further back in time. ‚Ä¶ The more history you learn, the larger the memory bank you can draw on when life takes a turn for which you are otherwise unprepared.‚Äù Through stories we learn, we grow, we collaborate, we empathize, and we better understand ourselves and where we might fit in the world.Like a runaway conspiracy theory on Breitbart, that brings us back to Barack Obama and Ben Rhodes. What the president suggested to Rhodes about storytelling in politics is just as true for us as individuals. Each time we read or hear about someone else‚Äôs experience, we can hold up a mirror to our own lives. We can listen for echoes of our own experiences and look for reflections of our own struggles. Seeing our story in someone else‚Äôs can be a profoundly powerful means of learning, understanding, and processing. Subconsciously or not, we can ask ourselves, What about this person‚Äôs story applies to my life? Can I learn something from her? What would I have done in his situation? What do I want to do in my own situation?That‚Äôs why we seek out others‚Äô stories. It‚Äôs also, as I‚Äôve come to appreciate, a good reason to share our own. Dozens of drafts of different sections of this article have been sitting on my computer for months. I could just leave them in the digital ether. After all, by getting these words out of my head and onto the digital page, writing has already served its core purpose for me. Why publish them here?I often think about this question in the context of my side hustle of writing about U.S. politics. I previously spent years working on Capitol Hill, but today most of my involvement in politics consists of arm‚Äôs-length commentary on this platform. The evolution from a full-time job in the trenches to an on-the-side-and-as-time-allows passion project has left me wondering: What‚Äôs the value of writing to causes I believe in? Writing about politics on the internet doesn‚Äôt knock on any doors or pass any bills or raise any money for candidates whose votes could actually alter public policy. It feels a little presumptuous to try to convince myself I‚Äôm helping others by writing my own thoughts down ‚Äî instead of canvassing to get out the vote, making phone calls for a congressional candidate, or trying to pass legislation on the Hill.In Tools of Titans, the writer Tim Ferriss considers what would happen if he chose a different line of work ‚Äî perhaps one with fewer solitary hours in front of the keyboard. ‚ÄúIf I stop writing,‚Äù he wonders, ‚Äúperhaps I‚Äôm squandering the biggest opportunity I have, created through much luck, to have a lasting impact on the greatest number of people.‚Äù Few writers are likely to end up with as large a platform as Ferriss has, but I think most of us share a similar desire to help people through writing. Is this hope realistic, or is it a self-serving justification to give ourselves permission to spend a huge amount of time doing something we enjoy?The act of publishing, of sharing one‚Äôs thoughts with the world, is a conscious choice not to assume that because we stumbled across an idea that the rest of the world already knows it. It‚Äôs to hope that others might find inspiration, clarity, or solidarity in our experiences and our ideas. It‚Äôs to aim to give readers a sense of community and, if we‚Äôre lucky, to help them make sense of the world by providing something they‚Äôre missing or hadn‚Äôt yet considered.But it‚Äôs also to accept that we might not achieve any of these goals, and to press ahead anyway. To publish one‚Äôs own writing is to welcome the possibility that this writing has already served its sole purpose ‚Äî to help the author process the world ‚Äî and to recognize that purpose as worthy enough in itself.In 1884, nearing the end of his life and in dire need of income, the writer with whom we began ‚Äî Ulysses S. Grant ‚Äî was convinced to write a series of articles that would eventually become his memoir. As Ron Chernow describes it, Grant originally found the process uninspiring. But, guided by a talented editor, he began to find joy and, presumably, some peace of mind in the task before him. ‚ÄúWhy, I am positively enjoying the work,‚Äù he remarked to his editor. ‚ÄúI am keeping at it every night and day, and Sundays.‚Äù Over time, Chernow writes, Grant ‚Äúexperienced the pride of authorship, pleasure of craftsmanship, and delight of reliving past triumphs.‚ÄùLike Grant, and like countless other writers, it took a long time for me to see writing not as an obligation but instead as an opportunity. An opportunity to make sense of the world. An opportunity to process my thoughts and experiences. An opportunity to figure out what I think. An opportunity to create. An opportunity to hone a craft. An opportunity to explore new ideas. An opportunity to share what I‚Äôve learned.Even if it doesn‚Äôt change any minds or pass any bills, the craft of writing helps me take the raw materials of life and transform them into something marginally coherent. Even if the only outcome of what I write, read, and share is a little more clarity about my own experience, that goal is undoubtedly worthwhile ‚Äî and the process itself is enormously fulfilling.Now, having thus made some sense of my thoughts, I‚Äôll click ‚ÄúPublish.‚Äù",30/05/2019,2,0,1,11,901,298,2,0,0,3,47

There Is No Such Thing As A Bad Book,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-bad-book-18ba745c9ba5,Sukhroop Singh,470,5,922,"I don‚Äôt think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and then it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children‚Äôs books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs tosh. It‚Äôs snobbery and it‚Äôs foolishness.This is what Neil Gaiman said in a lecture for the Reading Agency in 2013, and it so accurately tells the story of the life of a reader in the 21st century.From an early age, we are fostered for a love of reading. Up until the ages of about nine to ten, we love reading. And then‚Ä¶ it stops.Now we‚Äôre older, and Geronimo Stilton and Diary Of A Wimpy Kid just won‚Äôt cut it anymore. And although the adults and teachers in our lives mean well for us, the school curriculum has destined any love we had for reading as a child to the wastepaper basket.You stop them from reading what they enjoy, and start giving them ‚Äúthe twenty-first-century equivalents of Victorian ‚Äúimproving‚Äù literature.‚Äù Now we have to read The Outsiders, which, in all fairness, is an excellent book, but if it‚Äôs not a book that the child is not interested in, all you‚Äôve done is just momentarily stifled that child‚Äôs love of reading. And that child knows that, soon, they‚Äôll have a list of reading books they‚Äôll have to read over the summer, with books like Lord of the Rings and To Kill A Mockingbird and Great Expectations.And although these are great, great books, if they‚Äôre not books that the child is interested in, then all you‚Äôve done is stifled their love of reading.You‚Äôll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and, worse, unpleasant.What the adults in our life need to understand is that any reading, no matter if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù or a Geronimo Stilton‚Ä¶ is reading!It‚Äôs key to understand that many people have poured a lot into writing that book, some people their entire lives. For many people, that book is their entire life‚Äôs worth, no matter the supposed ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the book. How can you even determine the quality of a book anyway?So why are ‚Äúclassics‚Äù worth as much as the Geronimo Stilton‚Äôs?When you pick up a book, the simple act of reading is an immense pleasure.The drive to know what happens next, to turn the page, the need to keep going, even if it‚Äôs hard, because someone‚Äôs in trouble and you have to know how it‚Äôs all going to end ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a very real drive.That drive to keep on reading the book, no matter which book it is, no matter what it‚Äôs about, is going to force you to learn new things, new words, new ways of thinking, and it‚Äôs going to set you onto that never-ending, always-losing-its-direction, road to reading everything.Because everything we do in this world relies on words. We transverse the world with our words ‚Äî in this day and age, words have more power than they‚Äôve ever had. In a time where anything and everything we say is heard and can be recorded, how we piece together our word compositions is vital.‚Ä¶as the world slips onto the Web, we need to follow, to communicate and to comprehend what we‚Äôre reading.Through our words, we do so much, and without that power, hand symbols and translation programs will only get you so far.And so it‚Äôs vital that you give kids books that you can see that they enjoy (and you‚Äôll know if we like the book or not) and, no matter their reading level, no matter their subject matter, let us read them.When you read a book, you, your imagination, and an author, equipped with ‚Äúonly twenty-six letters‚Äù, can create new worlds, and look through the eyes of different people of different ages of different genders of different situations of different genetics‚Ä¶Really, reading is a phenomenon. When you‚Äôre reading, you can become someone else entirely, and change so much, create so much more empathy, while not even moving an inch (except to turn the page, obviously).You‚Äôre also finding out something as you read that will be vitally important for making your way in the world. And it‚Äôs this:THE WORLD DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. THINGS CAN BE DIFFERENT.So it‚Äôs vital to surround a child with books, not caring what they‚Äôre about, and let that child pick and choose which ones they like, which ones they dislike, and in the process of reading mature so much as a human being and as a character.Really, what I want to say is that the act of reading, in a world where the material means as much as the abstract, is something that a child (and even an adult ‚Äî we‚Äôre not excusing adults from growth here) can point to as something that defines them.In an age where a person is defined by the shoes they wear and the money they have and the things they say ‚Äî why not the books that they read as well?No book is a bad book, because a book is, by nature, something that will improve a child‚Äôs literacy, further their thoughts, their view of the world, and ultimately shape them as a human being.And what better to shape someone, than a book, not by shoes, or by Youtube, or by grades, but books? Isn‚Äôt that beautiful?If you liked this article, be sure to give me a clap or follow me for more great articles like this.Thank you for reading!",30/05/2019,3,0,4,15,1050,853,2,0,0,4,148
What Writer‚Äôs Block is Trying to Tell You,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/what-writers-block-is-trying-to-tell-you-392559b21239,Stef Hill,366,4,657,"To me writer‚Äôs block means one of two things:a) You need to go and do something else for a while. So go do that.b) What you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt working. At least, not in it‚Äôs current form.If the answer is b) then forcing yourself to carry on is counter productive. Either the idea isn‚Äôt good enough or you aren‚Äôt interested enough in it. That means either a not so great idea being played out or an enormous, counter intuitive effort to force yourself to go through with it.People are too harsh on themselves when they assume it must be their abilities or focus that‚Äôs to blame. Trying to force through an idea that‚Äôs really difficult to get excited about will produce a less than inspired result. Writer‚Äôs block is just trying to let you know that before you waste your time.I‚Äôve been there before. Sitting at my computer all day and all evening. Grinding away at some writing and hating every minute of it. In the end the result was something I didn‚Äôt like much and that somehow didn‚Äôt really work even if it served the purpose it was intended for.I‚Äôve examined this idea about motivation being sapped by uninspiring ideas before. The brain is a natural problem solving machine and if you can‚Äôt force yourself to do something then change is necessary.People always overlook the fact that writers don‚Äôt just write words and stories and characters. They write ideas.Let‚Äôs not mess around. You can write. I know you can, you know you can. That‚Äôs what makes writer‚Äôs block so frustrating. I also know you could apply all your talents to doing a good job on an uninspiring idea, but is that really the best use of your time?Trust your own ability, trust your own judgement and your own feelings.Don‚Äôt ask yourself why you can‚Äôt write.Just realize you have no interest in writing that.If you have writer‚Äôs block then you need to come up with some different or better ideas. As promised, here is one of the best techniques I‚Äôve ever found to generate ideas.A few years ago I was discussing the familiar feeling of staring down blank space with another writer and I brought up Jack Kerouac‚Äôs novel On the Road. I told my friend that Kerouac wrote to music in a free flowing, stream of consciousness form.If you want to be generous to me that was a massive oversimplification. If you don‚Äôt want to be generous, I was talking rubbish. I was 23 at the time and had fallen for the mythologizing of Kerouac‚Äôs work that he himself loved to perpetuate.One thing I did know for sure though was that Chuck Palahniuk had said he wrote most of Fight Club with the Nine Inch Nails album The Downward Spiral playing on repeat in the background. I suggested that we both took songs we loved and crafted a piece of writing while that song played on repeat.The result, in a nutshell, was that we came up with great ideas. It‚Äôs true that the writing itself as a standalone may have been a bit obtuse to anyone not listening to the music at the same time. What both pieces of writing did contain though were really strong ideas. This was because we had decided to not just listen to the music but focus on it and write down thoughts in response to sound and the emotions they produced within us.In the process the clunky, uninspiring ideas we‚Äôd convinced ourselves we were stuck with were completely forgotten.We both managed to write like demons for the rest of the day. After generating such a crop of good ideas it was simple to pick the best and most useful and run with them.All that had changed was marrying up our motivation to write with our motivation to write a particular idea.If you enjoyed this post please bear in mind you can sign up to Medium using my referral link, Stef Hill.",30/05/2019,2,0,4,4,879,492,4,0,0,8,41
How Olfactory Cues Can Drive and Shape Your Story,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/how-olfactory-cues-can-drive-and-shape-your-story-5c0fba5bb2bf,Flo Furem,1200,5,929,"We‚Äôve all heard about the famous writers‚Äô dictum ‚ÄúShow, don‚Äôt tell.‚Äù But it‚Äôs kind of icky and hard to come by without practical examples, at least to me. And how do you ‚Äúshow‚Äù how something smells? Showing, is visual, after all, isn‚Äôt it?That‚Äôs why I always like to turn movies and books into little thought experiments for myself. So, let‚Äôs unravel this mystery called olfactory cues, shall we?The ground rules of ‚ÄúShow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù aren‚Äôt complicated. Instead of naming the effect you‚Äôre aiming for ‚Äî say, tension, disgust, or suspense ‚Äî you as a writer are supposed to draw a picture that makes the reader come to that conclusion or feeling by himself. ‚Äî ‚ÄúI bet he‚Äôs the bad guy!‚ÄùHowever, this concept will apply to several aspects of your piece.You can‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ show how brave your protagonist is in the face of evil.‚Ä¶ show the way he was shaped by his supporting friends, making a statement at the same time.‚Ä¶ show why his last challenge surpasses all the previous ones.There are so many opportunities for showing something that you cannot call this one principle. Just like a metaphor doesn‚Äôt have one single purpose.So, in theory, we could make an entire series out of this topic. But for today, I‚Äôd like to focus on olfactory accents and cues contributing to your scene.Well, that‚Äôs a simple one. Because they are so underused that you can easily make yourself stand out just by coming up with only a single comparison.Few writers are known for emphasizing smells abundantly. Orwell, for instance. He is the rare exception to the rule of not bothering.But scents are a fantastic tool to paint a picture, even though you‚Äôre not ‚Äúpainting,‚Äù if you catch my drift.I, for one, have a horrible sense of smell. Seriously, I cannot tell a can of bad tuna from a cigarette stub. But observe yourself right this instant! What happened to you when you read about tuna and cigarettes? I bet your brain fired memories and images all over the place. If you‚Äôre particularly sensitive regarding smells, you might even have experienced a physical reaction.Even I, the partial anosmic, know scents that remind me of childhood memories. And even I enjoy nothing more than summer rain falling onto a road‚Äôs asphalt after it has been glowing with heat for weeks.I believe that smell has the potential to reach us on a deeper level, simply because it is less obvious than vision.Imagine you witness a bank robbery. How many people, do you think, could describe what the robbers looked like, and how many could tell you their scent? Granted, it might not contribute as much to a forensic investigation outside of CSI: Miami, but you get what I‚Äôm saying.medium.comMany subtle differences within the realm of showing are still widely underestimated.You can describe a smell shortly after or before mentioning a character, thus attributing some of the associations to him or her.Setting a scene can largely benefit from describing smells, especially when you combine them with cues for the other senses.To my view, you achieve the most elegant and artistic way of embedding olfactory hints into your plot by not mentioning them actively. What do I mean by that?Let‚Äôs revisit our bank robbers. Imagine they haven‚Äôt appeared yet, we‚Äôre still describing the setup, including the everyday working class visitors, the clerks, the security.Our narrator (or our camera, same thing) narrows down on an elderly gentleman in a trenchcoat. First, he walks with the driven walk of a businessman, but then, he suddenly stops, slowly shuffles back, and looks up at the fans above the entrance in irritation. As he slowly moves on towards the counter, he keeps sniffing his coat. He approaches the clerk and patiently opens his suitcase on the counter when he notices a fly landing on his papers. First, he brushes it off with the back of his hand; then it lands on his neck until he smacks himself and the troublemaker with his right hand.What happens next? ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know. Perhaps the bank robbers used a part of the sewerage to get inside the building and had to turn off some fans that blow its smell out of the bank.But we want to focus on the smell, right? Where is it? I didn‚Äôt mention one scent, on purpose.And yet, you probably didn‚Äôt think that the elderly gentleman looked into the fan because he was worried about his hairpiece. I‚Äôve relocated the smell‚Äôs function to the character‚Äôs reaction. This is a trick you have to use when you‚Äôre writing a screenplay, simply because we can‚Äôt communicate smell on the big screen.Just have a look at the final scene in Safe House if you want to get a feeling for that. Deep inside, you know this safe house smells like a pigsty. Watch it, you‚Äôll notice.In our scene, we could split this up and describe the foul smell of waste coming through the fans to contrast it with the clerk‚Äôs aftershave.However, relocating the smell‚Äôs effect to reactions and scenes can also be an artistic measure within a literary text. Try to think of all the structural elements that go into your story. You can play with nuances of smell, allocating it to different themes and motives.There are hundreds of ways to bring scents into your story. Just don‚Äôt neglect it. As soon as you think about the opportunities, it brings along, a whole world of new tropes and motives will open up to you.Use them and become one of the writers we admire and love, because they cared enough to catch the volatile.",31/05/2019,0,0,15,22,1050,627,3,1,0,8,64
How to Write the Book You‚Äôve Always Wanted to Read,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/how-to-write-the-book-youve-always-wanted-to-read-a33fec394d3b,Anisa Nasir,1300,3,549,"‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a book you want to read, but it hasn‚Äôt been written yet, then you must write it.‚Äù ‚Äî Toni MorrisonWe can scare ourselves into thinking that the upcoming idea we have is just a bit too far-fetched, too different, maybe even a bit weird. What‚Äôs important to remember when sitting down to begin writing that book is how you gauge its readability. As you open up a new document or turn a new page, the only person‚Äôs criticism you should take into consideration is your own. Spending your time worrying about how someone may have shot your idea down, or how it may be received once it‚Äôs finished will only hold you back. Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôre going to go through with that idea anyway because it‚Äôs a book you want to read.I have been struggling with this my entire writing journey because I couldn‚Äôt see myself thinking outside of the box, and creating something that made me feel uneasy. When you sit down to begin planning your next big writing project, you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about someone else might think of it, because the fact of the matter is ‚Äî you‚Äôre never going to please everyone.As you sit down to begin writing, to start this new journey for your characters, for the world you‚Äôve created, you have to believe in your work. No matter how different it may seem, no matter how hard it may be to push past your own limitations, it can be really refreshing to challenge yourself to write something that keeps you on the edge of your seat.When the ideas come flooding in for an integral part to the story or its climax, it‚Äôs important to make a note of it, but as you‚Äôre writing your only focus should be on developing that chapter. I‚Äôve had this experience in the past, where I was so focused on getting to the ‚Äúgood part‚Äù that I let the rest of the novel fall behind.Set the scene as if you‚Äôre there, let your characters engage with each other and the environment in a way that makes the unusual feel real. That is how I‚Äôve begun to have such a great appreciation for the fantasy genre because a well-written fantasy novel will place you right in the middle of its world.We forget this from time to time, but as writers, we can write about whatever we want. There is no rulebook to storytelling. You are in charge of the story, its development, and just how incredible it can become. If you‚Äôre struggling with an idea that you‚Äôre afraid of exploring, I say give it a write.You never know what could come of that story, you‚Äôll never know how good it‚Äôll feel to have it finished if you don‚Äôt begin. The only way we learn and grow as writers is to practice, challenge ourselves, and put in the work even if it scares us.Write that novel and spend your time focusing on developing the world of your characters, their experiences, and what they see around them. It can really change a story when you stop telling the reader what‚Äôs going on and start showing them.Thank you for taking the time to read this blog post!Follow me on Medium for more writing content or check out my blog.",30/05/2019,2,0,7,9,1050,459,2,0,0,6,152

I am drowning in self-doubt, questioning my place here, making me want to quit. For no reason ‚Äî or at least no apparent reason.I know you have all been there because I read all your articles about it. I know you have all felt it because I felt it with you when reading through your lines and phrases. I know how paralyzing and hopeless you feel.I feel it now. I‚Äôm feeling it in my bones and in the shivering when I can‚Äôt fall asleep at night. I feel it when I hit ‚Äúpublish‚Äù, closing half-eye, looking away ‚Äî before it can stop me midway and make me hit ‚Äúdelete‚Äù instead.I feel I am fooling you, I am lying to you, I feel I am a fraud.And I am terrified when you will finally discover it ‚Äî and start to laugh at me or even worse, abandon me.And I am lying to myself too.I started to write. And I can‚Äôt get myself to call myself a writer. I am not even an aspiring writer. I am awe-inspired by all of you, the writers on Medium, and I have to tell you all, you scare the sh*t out of me. You all know what you are doing, you ARE writers, as opposed to me, who is here lurking around you, hoping I can one day become one of you.But I think that I am lying, to all of you‚Ä¶Hello, Imposter syndrome, my old friend. I know you, oh-so-well. And I know what you are up to ‚Äî again!I have known you way before I became part of the writing community, I just didn‚Äôt know you had a name. I recognize you from the familiar grip of your greedy cold fingers on my heart. I know it‚Äôs you from the way you make me question everything I say or do. You‚Äôve done that before in other areas ‚Äî you made me feel worthless, you made me feel I am nothing. And now that I started writing, here we go again‚Ä¶You are ruining my days ‚Äî from the inside. You are the enemy within my mind. You are in my head, you are not even real ‚Äî but on these days nothing feels more real than my battle with you.You are telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt do anything as long as it isn‚Äôt perfect. And you are telling me it will never be perfect.I am not perfect. All I can do to fight you off is to tell myself that I don‚Äôt need to be perfect to succeed.This is what I keep telling myself‚Ä¶‚Äú‚Ä¶you can, you should, and if you‚Äôre brave enough to start, you will.‚Äù ‚Äï Stephen KingYou are a writer. Just the fact that you write makes you a writer.But also, because people read you; because your stories resonate with your readers. Because if one single person is touched by your story or one single sentence helps someone ‚Äî you already accomplished something.And you might not be a good writer but you are a good enough writer.You are doing your best to become the best version of you. You are improving, you are taking it seriously, you are putting a lot of work, time and energy to it. You are reading, you are experimenting. You are writing a lot and editing even more.I can see myself writing all day, I can see quitting my job and being able to pay my bills from just the words I am putting on paper. I can see myself on the porch of a country house somewhere in Tuscany ‚Äî dedicating my life to what I have always wanted.I don‚Äôt know when that will come ‚Äî or if it ever will. I don‚Äôt know whether from all the ideas I‚Äôve ever had for a novel which one will be the one that gets written. I don‚Äôt know if that house will really be in Tuscany. I don‚Äôt know, and I don‚Äôt need to know, because it is a dream, and I didn‚Äôt yet lay out a plan for it.When you dream big, you can easily silence your imposter syndrome with the words: It‚Äôs just a dream. And then you get back to reality and you can carry on with writing or struggling with it.Dreaming big is important: it is setting your true north to follow. It is how your decisions are made towards one single direction. You might not advance always directly there, but at every turn, you have the choice to decide which road will bring you closer to the final destination.Because perfect is overrated and unsustainable‚Ä¶Setting goals is different from dreaming. It‚Äôs a lot trickier business. The goals are like a staircase in the dark where you take one step after the other. You don‚Äôt need to see the whole staircase; it is enough just to see the next step and maybe one or two after ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to plan too much in advance anyway.Plans fail, life happens.If you can‚Äôt reach one goal, then you can re-iterate it, start anew, start from a different direction, make a workaround ‚Äî as long as it keeps you moving toward your true north.The problem usually occurs when you set unattainable goals. Imposter syndrome is very resourceful: after all, it is your creativity that fights you. That very creativity that fuels your writing can paralyze you in various ways when it takes the form of the imposter syndrome.Even with attainable goals, the imposter syndrome might be lurking around you, frowning at each accomplishment, diminishing the value of what you have achieved. But being dedicated to writing, you can shoo it away easily. You have just received tons of feedback in different forms (views and reads and fans and followers and attention and comments). It is obvious that people believe in you more than you believe in yourself, and for a while you are fine and you get back to working on the next article, next chapter, next book.It is very important to set your goals in a way that they should be just a little bit out of reach. Just to push you forward, just to motivate you to try again if you fail. Just enough to make you work harder or try different routes and strategies. To make you read more, look for more inspiration.The series of smaller, close-to-attainable goals will help in keeping you on the track towards your dream more, than huge leaps of bigger goals.What sounds realistic for you? 10 more fans? Set it to 15 and work for it! Always consider what is something that you can easily reach. What can you accomplish in a sustainable way? Start from reality and move slowly toward your goals. Do not double the expectations and do not raise the bar continuously. It is a process and you should be enjoying the journey too. Writing is about passion, if you imply the same rules as a factory, permanently raising the normative, you will lose all the fun and just the work and struggle remain.Don‚Äôt compare your journey to somebody else‚Äôs. Your journey is yours and yours only. It is your learning curve, it is in your pace, you need to own it. You have never walked in anybody else‚Äôs shoes, you have no idea what they sacrifice to be where they are, you don‚Äôt know their struggles, you don‚Äôt live with their demons and imposter syndrome.Setting smaller goals gives you more opportunity to celebrate victory ‚Äî and tell off your imposter syndrome. It also allows you to surprise yourself more often ‚Äî leaving you speechless and grateful.You have heard of the writer‚Äôs toolbox, it comes in handy whenever you start writing. It‚Äôs within reach for you, it helps you move forward.Creating a set of tools for your daily battles with the enemy within is just as useful as grammar and vocabulary:",31/05/2019,5,0,6,4,1050,687,4,2,0,8,696

SEO : Just Take A Chill Pill,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/seo-just-take-a-chill-pill-b6dd1fb6f7b1,Moumita De Sarkar,35,4,743,"I care about the SEO while writing. As a matter of fact, sometimes SEO gets more preference than writing itself in my posts. You will say ‚Äòwhy shouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äô Any blogger should take SEO seriously. I know.Don‚Äôt worry. This post is not about Why Search Engine Optimization is important? or How can you improve your blog‚Äôs SEO? This is about something else(in case you haven‚Äôt realised yet from the post title).Have you ever felt suffocated by having too much discipline in your life? Of course, rules and regulations are there to improve the quality of life. Agreed. But at the same time, too much of anything is not good. It sucks out the fun part. The relationship with my writing and SEO revolves around the same bittersweet philosophy.I have a SEO plugin installed in my WordPress blog. The purpose was obviously to point out the problems or improvement areas in my writing. It‚Äôs presence guides me to have a better quality of writing. But just like a disobedient student, I ditch that somewhat monotonous mode of writing at times. And there is hardly any shame in me admitting that I quite enjoy the breaks from ‚ÄòDos and Don‚Äôts‚Äô of SEO. Rather I consider it as my ‚Äòcheat day‚Äô.In past, I have taken many such breaks. Reasons varied every time. Sometimes, I wasn‚Äôt able to figure out the focus word apt for my post. Or the post title didn‚Äôt fit well into the width set by the SEO standards. And most of the time, even after the repeated warnings from the SEO plugin, I didn‚Äôt distribute my content into necessary sub-headings (how am I supposed to apply sub-headings in stories by the way?). Still I try to stick to SEO‚Äôs rules to the very best of my ability. And that aways comes with some compromises here and there in my writing :I want a short and simple title. But hey. Mr. SEO wants you to use compelling call-to-action titles with length that is neither too short nor lengthy. So it‚Äôs better to put something that he likes (and I hate).I want to express what I am thinking in one sentence without caring a damn about it‚Äôs length. However, the ‚Äòsentence length‚Äô parameter in SEO plugin cruelly demands me to break/shorten the sentence.This is only a small list of my grievances with SEO.While I was writing the post Should Monsoon Arrive In My State? , the readability analysis came up with few problems (as usual). One of them was about consecutive sentences. It said :Consecutive sentences : The text contains 4 consecutive sentences starting with the same word. Try to mix things up !I drilled down to the problematic zone. And going by my past experience(and thanks to the SEO plugin‚Äôs highlight feature), it didn‚Äôt take me much time to realise where I ‚Äòwent wrong‚Äô exactly. I had 4 consecutive sentences that started with the word ‚ÄòThere‚Äô.I had taken suggestions of these kind seriously earlier. But that day, I decided to ignore the improvement advice. For I wished the sentences to remain in my post the way they are in the above image. Listening to SEO needs here would kill all the fun (and sarcasm) in the paragraph. And I can‚Äôt compromise that in my writing at any cost. It was even complaining about the SEO title width. However, I didn‚Äôt pay any attention to the problems and went ahead with publishing my post.The post may not fetch good ranking, audience views and clicks because of my decision. It may be a really stupid mistake for any blogger to do as such. Let it be. I simply wanted my writing to break free from the shackles of SEO and breathe freely.SEOs are there to provide writers/bloggers the best guidance to improve writing, enhance their blog‚Äôs ranking and presence in the world wide web. That is the reason why I too adhere to the SEO guidelines (when I am not cheating on it). Having said that, few parameters shouldn‚Äôt rule my writing. Why can‚Äôt I just experiment with words without worrying about the SEO and it‚Äôs subsequent impact on my blog?The creative craft called writing does not always need to be measured with traffic, likes, clicks and comments. What bloggers really need is to relax and enjoy the process of writing for a change. Or is it too much to ask in this age of internet that is home to billions of blogs/websites?What do you think?",30/05/2019,1,0,5,3,1032,460,3,0,0,5,77
I Learned The Key To Successful Writing On A Tour Of Mark Twain‚Äôs House,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/i-learned-the-key-to-successful-writing-on-a-tour-of-mark-twains-house-15faee80d1a0,Miranda Lipton,102,4,614,"On a Memorial Day Weekend visit to see my mom in West Hartford, it seemed as good of a time as any to tour the Mark Twain house. There was some appeal to walking his home, but more-so I sought the secret to my success as a writer!Much of Twain‚Äôs writing was done in his lavish Victorian Gothic style home in Hartford, Connecticut. During the time he lived here in the late 1800s, Hartford was the wealthiest city in the nation, as well as a major publishing hub ‚Äî hence the residency of the Clemens family.Clemens? That brings me to the first thing I learned on my tour. Mark Twain isn‚Äôt really Mark Twain; well‚Ä¶he is, but his birth name is Samuel Langhorne Clemens. The name Mark Twain actually comes from a riverboat term. Clemens was a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River when he was a boy. Twain literally means ‚Äútwo‚Äù and so Clemens would have often heard ‚Äúmark twain!‚Äù as an order to mark the depth of the water they were traveling in. His time on the river inspired his book, Life on the Mississippi.Another bit of knowledge I gained from the tour was that the writer‚Äôs daily output was often around 4,000 words. In other words: I better up my game!I walked into the house hoping to extort any wisdom that I could from Twain himself. It was a stretch; but the rest of the group was in awe so I figured it was for something deeper than the details of his wallpaper, right? Maybe not.We all shuffled into the bathroom and I listened to my fellow tour-mates oohing and aahing once again.People are remarkably easily entertained; and I‚Äôm not dissing that! I often wish I was an easier sell. But instead I stood gawking at the toilet; trying to communicate with the ghost of Mark Twain‚Äôs shit just to make sense of my surroundings!Sadly, no luck. I dragged myself into the next room. My mom would not have been pleased if I left halfway through the tour.This room was his office, by far the coolest room in the house; the place where the magic happened! I saw his desk and imagined him sitting in that very corner, cranking out 4,000 words a day. I stared out the window in his office hoping the same tree Twain saw would illuminate Huckleberry Finn 2 before my eyes. After a few unpromising minutes, I came to terms with my harsh reality. Yes it was the same tree, and that‚Äôs cool and all; but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶.a tree. And much to the chagrin of my tour-mates, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶a toilet.But the 4,000 words a day‚Ä¶that was the illumination of Huckleberry Finn 2. And I got what I came for: wisdom from Twain himself! It just so happens to have been relayed through an unamused tour guide as a routine fun fact. When I heard it though, it felt like Twain was imparting his all encompassing wisdom onto my helpless self ‚Äî constantly searching for the single answer to my success as a writer.Writers need to write, that‚Äôs old news. But somehow hearing this truth of Samuel Clemens‚Äô success ‚Äî so simple and candid ‚Äî made sense of my reality.He settled into his desk each morning after breakfast, smoked between 25‚Äì30 cigars throughout the day (I guess they sufficed for lunch?), and got up when it was time for dinner. That‚Äôs what it takes to be Mark Twain.I could tour the homes of Hemingway, Shakespeare and Dickens but I‚Äôll save myself the boredom and money. I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôd discover the same two things: they all had lovely toilets and they all spent their days writing!Favorite Mark Twain/Samuel Clemens quotes",30/05/2019,2,0,1,3,1050,416,2,1,0,4,87
How Changing from a To-do List to a Schedule Transformed my Writing,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/how-changing-from-a-to-do-list-to-a-schedule-transformed-my-writing-6fd5ad31310,Jim Wolstenholm,746,5,928,"What do you do when you get stuck? What works for you when you just can‚Äôt seem to turn out any decent writing? If you are barely getting by or not getting by, here‚Äôs what worked for me.My family and I went through a year of major transitions. I was exhausted and my blog was suffering. I purposely took a month off to be able to make a move across the country and establish a new routine. A month wasn‚Äôt enough!I was desperately wanting to produce more quality writing to help my subscribers and followers. I spent weeks publishing just a minimum of work. Often, my process was sloppy, hurried and low quality. I was convinced that producing more quality work would not only benefit my readers by my writing as well. Thanks for the challenge and encouragement, Shaunta Grimes and Shannon Ashley.I have spent years working off a to-do list. Each day I had a prioritized list that helped me complete the days tasks. That was no longer working for me. I had things on my list every day to help accomplish my writing goals. But here‚Äôs what happened.I would look at the list and decide what absolutely had to be done and what I could put off. I became a master of procrastination instead of a master of productivity! I just felt the items on the list were easier to do tomorrow. I would look for the easy items and accomplish them instead.I was finally exasperated with myself enough to make the change! I decided to chuck the to-do list and make myself a work schedule instead.My life would work within a solid structure that I designed. My mindset changed from ‚Äúthis is what I have to do‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is when I am doing it.‚Äù It‚Äôs no longer optional; it is scheduled.My schedule would start with getting up in the morning. In fact, the first few things on the schedule were things that were important and enjoyable to me, so I could start my days with some wins!I incorporated my writing process into my schedule in a logical (to me) way. This also helped me move through the day accomplishing all I want to do. I allowed enough time to complete each task, so some items get more time, some less.I get up early and begin my day with a 45 minute walk. It‚Äôs dark when I head out and when I get home but I enjoy the solitude and fresh air. The walk helps me focus my day. I allow my mind to wander but will also spend a little time thinking about my writing.Next, I have breakfast. I have always been a breakfast eater so I enjoy a light breakfast with a cup of tea.After I have eaten, I spend time in prayer and Bible reading. This is a priority in my life and is the final step of preparation for my day of work.Then, I take a break for personal care and hygiene. I help with a few short chores around the house, taking care of some urgent things that might distract me.It‚Äôs scribble note time! This is a time that I take an idea and write everything I can think of about it. In no particular order and in a completely random way, I write things down on a piece of paper. I never use my computer for this step. I will rearrange these ideas, thoughts, questions and so on later when I build my notes into something more.Then I write a rough draft. I don‚Äôt use the scribble note I just wrote but one from a previous day. This allows the idea and thoughts to marinate a little in my subconscious. It also allows me time to add to my scribble notes when more thoughts come to me.Next, I write my blog post. Again, I don‚Äôt use the rough draft I just completed but one from a previous day. Changing topics from scribble note, to rough draft, to blog post also keeps the process fresh for me.After my blog post is complete, I promote it through social media. I also take time to look at all my social media accounts and take any action I need to.Finally, I review my email. This used to be my major distraction to completing my to-do list and since it was on my to-do list became the one thing I accomplished each day! Now, I don‚Äôt even glance at my email on my phone when I get up. I used to eliminate the junk email upon rising!Somewhere in there I have lunch too!I need structure. I have worked unsupervised but accountable for 15 years but the move took away the accountability, so I had to reinforce my routine with a solid structure. That structure is working!It helps my focus. I am not thinking about the next thing. I look at my schedule and say: ‚Äúwhat am I supposed to be doing right now?‚Äù I know that I will get everything done every day if I stay with my schedule.It gives me positive reinforcement daily. Every day I finish my schedule knowing that I have accomplished my tasks.I am now publishing four blog posts each week. I am building a store house of rough drafts and scribble notes for future work. Once I have enough rough drafts, I will increase the number of weekly published posts.I don‚Äôt know if I will change my process in the future but this is working right now! I‚Äôd love to hear what you think, so please leave a comment!",30/05/2019,3,0,8,0,1050,511,3,0,0,8,257

The AI application streamlines drilling data and processes predictive algorithms through a ‚Äúdrilling simulator‚Äù which makes real-time decisions regarding the drilling and extraction of the natural resources.www.datadriveninvestor.comSecondly, Shell has also successfully implemented a cloud-based deep learning application built on Microsoft Azure, which uses gas stations‚Äô live camera footage to identify safety hazards and to alert employees immediately.Thirdly, Shell has integrated innovative digital experiences for all of its employees globally to foster a more personalized collaborative environment through Microsoft communication applications such as Microsoft Stream, SharePoint Online and Yammer.The collaboration of Shell with Microsoft has been very successful on so many levels. Shell has implemented AI applications through C3 to all aspects of its business and has optimally improved its drilling and extraction processes. On the first hand, it is refreshing to witness the implementation of AI in fields other than IT, software development or telecommunications. The integration of AI in the oil and gas industry has improved the drilling and extraction processes and therefore has improved the overall production chain which in return has also improved the consumption chain, and has made more resources available to more consumers in less time. The implementation of AI has also ecological implications because fewer rock layers are being drilled as the ‚Äúdrilling simulator‚Äù is able to predict which rock layers contain oil and gas and only those layers are drilled, which saves unnecessary drilling and all its harmful consequences to the environment.On the other hand, I wonder why it took Shell so long to finally adopt a digital transformation on a global scale. It seems that Shell Global Solutions has attempted a digital conversion in the past which was unsuccessful. Indeed, the digital conversion of the company was only possible with the assistance of Microsoft which helped develop effective AI applications. Furthermore, Microsoft has helped other energies and petrochemical companies leverage the power of AI to control costs and achieve operational efficiencies, such as Chevron and ExxonMobil. It seems that all these petrochemical companies are seeking a strategic advantage by using the same technology solutions from Microsoft and branding these solutions as their own. Microsoft is on its way to take over the oil and gas industry.",31/05/2019,0,0,3,1,875,380,2,0,0,4,70
Collect the Data For Data Analysis Using Web Scraping in Python,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/collect-the-data-for-data-analysis-using-web-scraping-in-python-97c153f1b20,Jayesh Manani,14,4,625,"This post is about How to Start scraping the data from the Websites automatically In Linux environment and then use it to develop some insight from the data. We are going to scrape the craigslist.org websiteFollow this link and get the source code folder. ‚Üí https://github.com/jayeshmanani/Web-Scraping-Using-Scrapywww.datadriveninvestor.comI do not recommend to scrape anything from any website. This post is only for learning purpose. Do not misuse it. Better to use API for the data collection from any website if they are providing the same.Hope You have Python installed already on your machine.First, we set up the Virtual Environment for this Project. So, It will be easier to handle the Dependencies.For creating the Virtual Environment You can first make the Directory for Storing the FilesSo, Create a Folder name it as you want at the location/directory you want.If you are using Linux you can use Terminal and follow the steps.I am creating the Folder in the Desktop named Scrapy_Project. (I am Using Linux)Now move to the Directory We just created for the Project using Linux commandNow we are going to create the virtual environment in the folder using the command mentioned belowNow, You can see there is a New Folder appeared in your Project Folder Scrapy_ProjectYou can check the list of the files & Folder in the Current Directory using the commandNow we activate the virtual environment created just using the commandNow, you can see before your username of the Linux you will see the environment name.So, We have successfully activated the virtual environment.You can deactivate the virtual environment at the end using the commandNow started with the install and use the Scrapy to start learning about using the Scrapy framework.after a successful installation of the framework, you can go ahead and start our first Scrapy project using the commandand this will create a new folder named myFirstScrapy folder containing some predefined files inside it.Now go inside the Folder just created myFirstScrapyNow we are going to create a Spider which can crawl the web page using the commandNow, you can find that spider inside the myFirstScrapy/spider directory named as jobs.pyNow open the jobs.py file in any text editor of your choice.You will find some predefined things.edit the start_urls and put this URL in place of already mentioned == ‚Äòhttps://mumbai.craigslist.org/search/eve'and add replace this link in allowed domains ==> ‚Äòwww.mumbai.craigslist.org'Now it will look likeHere start_urls are the U from where your scraper start the scraping work.Now, Add this line to the parse function in the jobs.pyThis will print the name of the Url it is parsingNow add this code to the parse function. This will fetch all the CSS element with class result-title. And it will store the elements in the titles variable as a list.now make a loop and print name one by one using the enumerator for printing the count aside.and your whole jobs.py file looks like this code snippet.Now, You can go to the terminal and start scraping the title of the event going to happen using the commandthis will print the names with the count in the terminalif you want the JSON file or CSV file as output you can be doing so using this stepAdd this line before starting of the loopand now add this code in the loop likeand then start the crawler again using this commandAnd finally, it saved the data to the CSV file as output.csv in the Project Folder. And did it right.

Digital identity in #Fintech,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/digital-identity-in-fintech-fdf9f9ffecc6,Swapna M,706,7,691,"If you‚Äôre a newcomer to Canada without any prior financial history in its territory and want to open a bank account with any of the big financial institutions, you‚Äôd need to go through the in-person process of showing 2 pieces of government issued ID, undergoing KYC & AML processes. Or you can complete some of the processes online, but eventually, you‚Äôll have to send in your signatures or walk into a branch to identify and verify yourself.Certain types of banking accounts can be created by providing your SIN and other government-issued ID information online ‚Äî typically the bank would run a credit check against your SIN through a credit rating agency (Equifax/TransUnion, etc.).www.datadriveninvestor.comIf there is a mismatch in retrieving your credit and other information, the organization can ask you additional questions ‚Äî regarding the addresses you‚Äôve stayed at in the past few years, your previous years‚Äô tax refund amounts, certain credit card information such as balances and so on.If the information the bank retrieves about you from the credit rating agencies is not enough, they can open an account for you but maybe provide you limited functionality (eg. only 2 transactions in a month of a limited value) before asking to identify yourself in person in order to open up the full suite of banking services.If you don‚Äôt have any credit history as a newcomer to Canada, this process won‚Äôt work and you‚Äôd have to go through the traditional route of opening your bank account by identifying yourself in person at a bank branch.An average Canadian identifies themselves across many different organizations (provides their personal information, sensitive government issued ID etc.) ‚Äî in telecom companies while opening an internet connection or buying a mobile plan or whilst registering into a bank (opening a bank account), applying for a new credit card, identifying yourself at an hospital or while using the government CRA services and so on.This causes a segregated process of establishing identities multiple times across multiple organizations and service providers. This is cumbersome to the end user as a measure of time, resources and effort of remembering multiple authentication credentials and creating identities time and again, putting their privacy and data at risk.In addition to the above, proving identity is incredibly inconvenient in the physical world, and fraught with friction in the digital world where the risk of fraud and identity theft is higher.Citizens should be able to log into Government e-services without having to create new passwords or user IDs. Citizens should not be required to show up in person at a kiosk or send pictures of confidential documents to prove who they are during initial onboarding or wait days to be granted access.Open Banking, the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are catalysts for digital developments.One of the most traditional ways of doing business with a bank is to walk into its branch, identify yourself i.e. showing 2 pieces of ID and do your KYC/AML processes in order to correctly identify yourself to the financial institution. The rest of the process of opening up a bank account etc. takes place after performing these basic preliminary steps.This process alone can take up a few hours notwithstanding the effort and time it takes for the client to physically walk into a branch and initiate a conversation with a branch advisor.Validation and authentication with digital identities are not widespread as of yet with the bigger more established banks ‚Äîit‚Äôs more common around smaller and digital-only banks eg. Tangerine, EQ bank, Simplii financial, etc.Accepting digital identities as a legitimate way to authenticate new and existing clients into the banking ecosystem would require changing mindsets and a holistic organization-wide transformation to digitize these traditional processes.It provides an opportunity to remove inefficient and time-consuming manual processes and achieve a reduction in fraud.But it‚Äôd be cool to see how we can leverage the identities created by a banking customer in one bank to identify him/her into another bank or an organization in a completely different industry such insurance or healthcare.Other use cases/scenarios include ‚ÄîBlockchain frameworks cater to the following principals -The above forms the basis of privacy-enhanced, triple-blind distributed architecture.",30/05/2019,0,0,13,0,875,357,2,4,0,6,31
Simple Text Summarizer using NLP,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/simple-text-summarizer-using-nlp-d8aaf5828e68,Renu Khandelwal,5100,6,693,"In this post, we will understand what is NLP- Natural Language Processing and its usage. We will go step by step to build a simple text summarizer. we will also understand some key concepts used in NLP like Bag of Words(BOW), Term Frequency(TF)and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)Future posts will explore Deep Learning NLP algorithms like Seq2Seq, BiDirectional LSTM, Attention seaech, Beam search, and Greedy learning.Natural Language Processing or NLP provides the tools to understand human language using computers. In NLP, we analyze the text, understand what is being communicated - like who is saying what, what is the topic being discussed to derive the meaning to make conclusions.Human beings communicate by first listening to what is being said and by whom. We try to understand what is being said and in what context and this helps us to derive the meaning.www.datadriveninvestor.comIn machine learning, we are trying to do exactly the same process.Where is Natural Language Processing used?A few applications of Natural Language Processing areHow do we use text for Natural Language Processing?This is a very valid question as Machine Learning algorithms understand only numeric data.Depending on the task, we use different NLP pipelines.We will discuss NLP Pipeline for simple Text Summarizer and then understand some key concepts in NLP: Bag of Words, Term Frequency (TF)and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)Source will be a wiki page that we will summarize in few sentences.Steps for creating NLP Pipeline for simple Text Summarizer.Step 1: Import the required librariesStep 2: Read the text from the source like text file or scrap the web page using the request library.We are scrapping the wiki page on ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù.The HTML content of the URL is available in a request variable.Displaying a small section of the HTML content which we read from the page that was stored in the variable requestStep 3: Token the text into words.We use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content to extract all the text with ‚Äòp‚Äô tag.We convert the text into lower case and then tokenize the text into words.Printing the tokenized words from the extracted sentencesWe can see stop words in the output like is, the, of, etc.Step 4: Process the tokenized words by removing punctuation, stop words and numbers.Stop words are words that occur frequently in text but do not add much meaning, words like the, and, of, etc.We now have clean tokens without stop words, punctuation and numbersStep 5: We create a frequency distribution of the 100 most common words also called as Bag of words (BOW) present on the web page.BOW is a collection of words that appear in the text or sentence with the word counts. Bag of words does not take into consideration the order in which they appear.Frequency distribution will tell us how the total number of word tokens in the text is distributed.Step 6: Tokenize the text from the web page into sentencesStep 7: Iterate through all the sentences in the web page to create ranking for each sentence.Ranking for the sentences will be based on the number of most frequent words. Higher the presence of the frequent words in the sentence, higher will be the ranking.Most Frequent words were identified in Step 5.printing one of the top 10 sentencesStep 8: Finally sort the sentences and print the top 10 sentences with the highest ranking.We can additionally apply stemming on the most frequent words. Stemming will use the root words this way machine and machines will not be two separate words in most common words list.For different types of NLP task some additional steps that can be performedTerm Frequency is how often a word appears in a document divided by how many words there are in the document. TF helps us understand a sentence containing the most frequent words. TF is used for one document.Challenge with TF is when stop words are given a higher term frequency.We can overcome this challenge by removing stop words like we did in our text summarizer or use Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)TF-IDF is used when we have multiple documents and helps identify sentences or documents with rare or unique words.This article will help you gain a basic understanding of NLP and web scrapping",30/05/2019,2,11,50,35,1011,320,14,2,0,3,98
Founder Interview ‚Äî Rana Mukherji,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/rana-mukherji-e1534138670,Christopher Roper,13,6,1226,"Having a deep passion for all thing‚Äôs technological, I became interested in the application of blockchain technology a couple of years ago.In 2018, I came across an interview at the Singapore Consensus with Rana Mukherji, who is the founder of Hotelier Coin; a company that has developed a blockchain based crypto-currency for the hospitality trade.I knew that I had discovered a rare find, a company that could disrupt an entire industry that was still in its early stages of development. The more I learned of Hotelier Coin, the more I became convinced that this new cryptocurrency would soon become a household name. In February 2019, I interviewed Rana Mukherji.www.datadriveninvestor.comWho is Rana Mukherji?Rana Mukherji is a hotelier at heart. For nearly two decades, he managed, operated and ran luxury hotels across the Middle East, India, North America, and Africa.Thoughts for a Revolution ‚Äî The Birth of Hotelier CoinWhile in Canada, Rana had aspirations for opening the ‚ÄòBoutique‚Äô hotel brand. After successfully spearheading a joint venture for Bespoke hotels, he packed a bag and set off for the Mediterranean. His aim was simple, to help his investor buy up small hotels with great potential. After interviewing over 30 different hotel owners to figure out the best way he could enter the marketplace, Rana began to discover a fundamental problem that existed within the industry. All owners, all customers and investors were having to go through third-party intermediaries and suffer the expensive commissions they had in place. Rana felt that in this modern age there must be a better way.After stumbling upon blockchain technology, he realized that he had found the answer. YouTube and other online resources gained a very keen student. He scoured the internet for all information that he could find on the blockchain, feeling certain that he could find a way to apply it to his industry. After forming a solid business plan, he knew that he would need the help of a technological company who could assist him in realizing his dream. A digital, borderless currency that could provide secure, completely transparent trade directly between the hotel and the customer. The days of the middlemen were numbered.Laying the Foundations ‚Äî Creating the PlatformRealizing the magnitude of his idea and the enormity of the task, Rana could not rest. He assembled a team of experts from both the hospitality trade and the technological industry to help him achieve his revolutionary goal. He understood that for his plan to succeed, all elements should be working together as a single, cohesive unit.The hospitality industry has lots of moving parts. From the traveler, the credit card, the booking platform, check-in & check-out, paying of vendors and staff salaries, all of these factors employ their own individual processes in order to work. Even when a customer simply orders a coffee, there is a progressive chain of procedures that takes place. Rana perceived the hotel industry as existing within its own ecosystem and believed that his digital cryptocurrency, Hoteliercoins, could join these dots together.His hotel booking platform, Hotelier Mart, verifies customer identity by collecting KYC (Know Your Customer) information and can serve to eliminate fake bookings and duplicated workload. Hotelier Mart passes on this information along with the customer profile, which provides the hotel with verified data as well as customer preferences. The need to collect the data at the front desk is no longer necessary which saves the hotel a lot of time and money. The customer also benefits by a less lengthy check-in procedure and would now have a much more enjoyable experience by having their personal tastes documented before they arrive. Continually swiping your credit card just to get through the front door will soon be a distant memory.Bringing Balance ‚Äî Relief for Smaller HotelsRana feels that technology belongs to everybody, not just those with deep pockets. During his earlier travels throughout the Mediterranean, he realized that there were smaller hotels that did not possess the same level of technology that the bigger brands did. This has the effect of causing 60‚Äì70% of their business to struggle, particularly hotels that have only 10‚Äì50 bedrooms. By partnering with a PMS (Project Management System) company, Hotelier Coin could provide all the luxury brands and technology to these smaller establishments for as low as $10 per bedroom, per month.Customer Rewards ‚Äî Cashback Wherever You TravelLoyalty and reward programs for customers are commonplace across many industries today. People can accumulate frequent flyer miles, get discounts across supermarkets and earn fine dining experiences at restaurants. Many of the larger hotel chains have their own reward schemes based on how often you stay with them. But what happens when you have been accruing loyalty points with a particular brand of hotels, and then travel to a location where they have no presence? The money that you spend on this particular journey goes unrewarded.By using one of the thousands of hotels connected to the Hotelier Mart network, a customer earns reward points and cashback regardless of which hotel they stay at. What is more, unlike frequent flyer miles and other reward schemes, a Hotelier Coin customer can monetize the tokens that they have collected at any time they choose. This gives an unprecedented level of financial control back to the traveler.Hotel Rewards ‚Äî Trading RoomsThis is what truly sets Hotelier Coin apart from any other company operating within the industry. By creating a decentralized exchange to trade in Hoteliercoin tokens, hotels can trade rooms as a commodity for the first time ever!Using the Ethereum blockchain as an enabler, Hotelier Coin will remove the need for intermediaries who siphon potential profits from the hotel just to bring the customer‚Äôs business to the door. Right now, for every $100 a hotel makes, a number of third parties such as banks, travel agencies, foreign exchange and credit cards take a percentage in commissions. Hotelier Coin gives money back to each individual business, allowing them to grow.Through the decentralized exchange that Hotelier Coin has created, the outdated legacy system of face-to-face negotiation is replaced by an Ask-and-Bid negotiation based on smart contracts. This new structure will create increases in profits and allow a hotel to focus more fully on the traveler.A Bright Economic Future ‚Äî An Entire Industry Trading Under a Single CurrencyHaving launched Hotelier Coin, Rana Mukherji is already busy discovering innovative ways to make the most of this new ecosystem of travel that he has created. The Hoteliercoin token is designed to perpetually gain in value, and he envisions a future where all manner of businesses within the industry such as car rental, flight booking and leisure experiences will operate under this one, borderless currency.A truly original concept that is currently being launched by Hotelier Mart, is the ‚ÄòHire a Private Chef‚Äô and ‚ÄòCity Hosts‚Äô schemes. These allow a customer the opportunity to hire an individual who lives in the local area to provide home-cooking as a personal chef or hire a guide to safely show them the sights of the city.The schemes will not only serve to vastly improve the experience of the traveler but also provide a boost to the local economies of many locations around the world.After recently forming a strategic alliance with SearchStays, a global vacation rental network of over 50,000 high-end locations, I feel quite assured that soon everybody who travels, either domestic or abroad, will be familiar with the Hoteliercoin Token.",30/05/2019,1,0,1,4,830,323,2,0,0,2,60

Increasing Demand in an Emerging Economy,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/increasing-demand-in-an-emerging-economy-7bfc89c62606,C Thinwa,13,5,1104,"In 2018, an economic survey found that the average Kenyan lives on USD78/Ksh. 7800 a month. They feed themselves with USD42/Ksh. 4,200 a month and spend the rest on non-food items.Even by Kenyan standards, this amount is quite low. Shopping at a supermarket on such a budget for one person is quite stressful; now consider that such a person is feeding aging parents, children or even (sometimes) a spouse.www.datadriveninvestor.comHow do people survive on so little?Some people save small amounts and then pool their resources to buy food in bulk and split it among themselves, or buy from retailers who do such activities (in Kenya, they form what is commonly referred to as the ‚Äúkadogo‚Äù economy because very small transactions are made when exchanging money for goods). Others save small amounts with their employer which they can cash out and use to pay school fees or other high-cost expenditures.Some people establish a good rapport with a small retailer in their neighborhood, ask for a soft loan which they use to buy food on credit, refunding the retailer once their monthly payment comes through.There are others who receive financial aid during mid-month when things are tight from NGOs, wealthier relatives, neighbors and/or friends; others ask their employer for a salary advance which is then recovered from their next payslip.All of the above are Kenyanized versions of 5 very common financial instruments: savings, credit, payments, insurance, and remittances.To have the conversation on stimulating growth in an emerging economy, we need to also appreciate and understand the economic and financial realities of the average consumer in that economy.There is the school of thought commonly known as trickle-down economics that basically argues that when we strengthen and formalize all the dynamics above, prosperity is automatic. However, we must remember that money must be earned first to be spent ‚Äî this is a time-intensive process; also, basic needs must be met first before investment needs. Finally, it‚Äôs hard to grow and participate in the global economy when it is a struggle to meet the most basic needs.For the purposes of this conversation, we shall assume that demand is the ultimate factor of economic growth (even though there are arguments to the contrary) in emerging economies. If we are ever to grow a $78 income, we have to stimulate and grow demand. It is my hope that someone doing business in an emerging market can find the suggestions on here of value and use in their day-to-day reality.An economist would tell you that demand is the number of goods that people buy at various prices over a particular timeline. From the definition alone, one would be tempted to simplify things and say that pricing and timing influence demand. However, there is a myriad of factors, known and unknown, that influence demand.5 key things that do influence the demand of an individual consumer include:When we look at emerging markets, the good‚Äôs/service‚Äôs price and the consumer‚Äôs income tend to go hand-in-hand. For many people, their incomes are low which force them to become price sensitive; this makes most businesses compete to either become cost-leaders and serve the masses, or niche-leaders and serve <20% of the population.Secondly, when income is low, consumer tastes and preferences play a less pronounced role. Price sensitivity also turns goods and services into commodities ‚Äî not many people stop to think about what brand of clothing, peanut butter and headphones they will be buying when their total budget is 3 dollars; they have to stretch that money and look out for bargains.A good example of this principle in action is how consumers in Nairobi shop for ladies‚Äô shoes. Bata Kenya is one of the largest shoe store chains in the country. Small shops (commonly known as ‚Äúexhibition‚Äù) stock shoes imported from foreign countries such as China and Turkey and individual importers of second-hand items also clean and sell shoes. In the eyes of a typical lady, those shoes are more or less the same.Seeing opportunity; there has now emerged a special kind of exhibition shops that only stock flat shoes for Ksh.500/ 5 US dollars. They are quite cheap and low quality (only lasting a year); however, they serve the purpose (walking on the roughed-up sidewalks of Nairobi) and they look stylish, almost identical to what you would find at a place like Bata.So what could businesses do to increase local demand and stay alive?Firstly, they need to figure out current tastes and preferences in the market by experimenting more often ‚Äî embracing risk and staying nimble. Before a business fully invests, why not sell the upcoming product directly to their target market? This will give them the opportunity to implement techniques such as A/B testing and get a feel of what the optimal price should be ‚Äî purchasing original research has long lead times and existing research is little and old. This is especially true when the target market is in rural areas. Plus, if done creatively, it can increase consumer expectations that the price will go up fast, so it would be wise to buy on the spot. This means that brands in such markets really need to generate feelings of ‚ÄúThis is such a great opportunity!‚Äù in the customer experiences that they create in the mass market.Secondly, businesses should make bundling their friend in an emerging market. When complements are paired with the good/service, the two help repel competition from substitutes. Businesses could consider entering into more strategic partnerships to combine domain strengths and scale faster. Furthermore, bundling can help in reducing price sensitivity in the long run.Thirdly, consider more co-creation opportunities with the consumer. Leverage on existing collectivism, common in most emerging market societies, by offering smaller quantities of the co-created product, discounts on the original product or even an increase in disposable income to the consumer when they get people in their network to use or buy the product. This will allow the network effect to work for you both offline and online. Create a symbiotic relationship with your consumer.Finally, focus on growing investment income drawn from a global portfolio to enable the business to have patient money and mitigate risk. If the business cannot open across a swathe of countries (investing its own equity in the countries), consider investing in the debt markets of those countries. This additional income can help fund more R&D and help the business when it‚Äôs going through an internal rough patch, a low season or even a dip in the business cycle.When we adopt a learner‚Äôs mindset to the market, we get to adapt and maintain control, allowing us to grow and scale more businesses in emerging markets.",30/05/2019,0,0,0,0,698,291,2,1,0,5,31
Playing with Instagram Data,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/playing-with-instagram-data-53ede72cb756,Sharvil,21,4,547,"With Instagram not providing a search mechanism for its chats, it becomes a really grueling task to look for older conversations which have traveled to the very start ‚Äî because the only potential way you could accomplish that is by scrolling through messages all the way to top and the loading pauses in between every few texts worsens it even more!So, in the hunt of finding a way out, for a less arduous alternative to such tiresome scrolling, I came to know that Instagram has finally rolled out a feature which enables users to request and download their Instagram data. The steps for requesting a download are:www.datadriveninvestor.comThey‚Äôll send a mail containing all your Instagram data within 48 hours on your registered email address, but chances are you‚Äôll receive the mail much sooner, in less than an hour. After extracting the compressed email attachment, you‚Äôll find a ‚Äúmessages.json‚Äù file which holds all your Instagram chats/direct messages you exchanged with other users.Once, you have the data at your disposal, we can finally start playing with the data we have at hand. The rest of the article will mainly focus on visualizing and analyzing the direct messages shared between two users (not group chats), let‚Äôs call them John and Jane. All the code and images used in this article can be found at Github.The data is a JSON array, with each element of array comprising of two keys, namely, participants, which in itself is a pair of users involved in that direct message, and conversation, which stores all the details of that conversation like message text, sender, timestamp, media, etcThe timezone of ‚Äòcreated_at‚Äô is changed to local timezone for ensuring clarity and alignment in further analysis. The timestamp of messages is then set as the index of the dataframe for utilizing efficient calculations. Meanings of some of the columns in the resulting dataframe are:sender ‚Äî username of person who sent the messagetext ‚Äî the text of message sentcreated_at ‚Äî timestamp of messagemedia_share_caption ‚Äî caption of shared media postslikes ‚Äî shared post likes, message likes, story likesNow that our data is ready to be queried upon, we‚Äôll first start by visualizing the count of messages sent by each user. And then let‚Äôs try to capture how the exchange of messages has increased overtime by re-sampling the data on a monthly basis.Media Share StatisticsNow, first let‚Äôs do a simple task of determining the number of posts, stories, animated gifs shared by each participant of the conversation and depict how their tallies add up.After that, as we‚Äôve got hands on all the captions of the Instagram posts shared in the attribute media_share_caption, let‚Äôs dig a little bit more and extract all the hashtags from those captions in an attempt to gain insights on the type of posts/media shared most frequently.Hourly Distribution of chatsLastly, let‚Äôs deep dive into how the chat messages are spread out throughout the day by plotting a descriptive pie chart which will clearly demonstrate the rate at which messages are transferred during twenty-four hours.In this article, we merely explored the direct messages data, there‚Äôs a lot more scope of visualizing and figuring out hidden patterns in other data offered by Instagram which you all can definitely try out!Let me know your views if you enjoyed the article!Until then, happy¬†visualizing!",30/05/2019,1,0,12,0,762,373,5,1,0,7,88

However, what‚Äôs not kosher is making a mistake-riddled piece of content public, even if it‚Äôs to just one reader or recipient, because of carelessness.Enter Grammarly, the foremost freemium Google Chrome spelling and grammar correction sidekick.Free to install on other word processors and OS‚Äôs too, I like their Chrome extension because it provides real-time suggestions in basically any open rich text editor. Whether it‚Äôs inside a third-party CMS or the online document editor of your choice.Disclaimer: Just like every other spellcheck app known to mankind, Grammarly isn‚Äôt perfect. It‚Äôll occasionally suggest the odd correction that isn‚Äôt actually a mistake or blatantly miss a typo that, in theory, it shouldn‚Äôt have.So, as a savior for the lazy or rushed, it will fall short, as will any other solution you place that burden on. However, as another set of automated eyes on your work, you can do far worse than GrammarlyAlso, if you have the extra cash to shell out for the premium version, I definitely recommend it.At the risk of sounding like a corporate shill for Google, the banner of weed-selling apps, let me preface this by quickly shouting out other popular cloud storage service Chrome extensions, like Microsoft OneDrive, that offer you much of the same functionality.However, since Chrome is a Google product, it only makes sense that Drive would be the most seamlessly integrated browser extension in this category. In that sense, Save to Google Drive is one of the handiest writing aids offered in the browser‚Äôs extension store.The app will take a screenshot of whatever content you have open in a given tab (with only a limited number of restrictions) and save it directly to the Google Drive account you have linked with your browser‚Äôs profile. It will also push a link notification immediately after the image uploads, so you‚Äôll be able to see the file‚Äôs Drive location.This is incredibly useful for quickly storing references, pictures or infographics you want to use in a blog post, examples of a potential final product, and so much more. The extension also chooses .png as the default file format for the images you save, so the quality and color specifications will be internet-friendly right out of the gate.As someone who is constantly misplacing interest quotes or inspirational examples from other articles, this app has saved my creative skin more than a few times and, down the line, it can potentially do the same for you.Speaking of saving things for posterity, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be in the professional position I am today if it weren‚Äôt for Pocket.A big part of making a living as a writer is consuming a lot of other people‚Äôs writing. It keeps you informed, it keeps you energized, it keeps you honest. That said, with so much interesting online content being produced every day, it‚Äôs hard to keep up with it all.That is, if you‚Äôre not using this glorious app.Pocket is a great place to store links of articles you can to read, complete with the ability to assign one or multiple tags to each one to help you compartmentalize your reading list. The app will also provide you with personalized recommendations based on your link saving history.The Chrome extension is where things get really easy. All you have to do is click on the Pocket logo and boom! Your link is saved to your profile automatically. Adding a tag is optional but, in my experience, highly recommended so that your reading list doesn‚Äôt get out of hand.For writers who are looking for a streamlined, intuitive way to keep track of the various blog posts, PDFs and even social media posts they want to read later on, Pocket is my favorite safe space when it comes to content that intrigues me. I always look forward to the end of my day when I finally get to knock one or two of those pieces off of my must-read list.Every writer I‚Äôve ever had a conversation with always extols the virtues of the synonym. When it comes to crafting prose that‚Äôs fresh and vibrant instead of dull and repetitive, they are an essential tool.However, using Google searches to search for those vocabulary alternatives is so early-2000s. I mean, if I had to open a tab every time I needed to say something a different way, my browser would‚Äôve just given up long ago.A great way to avoid that kind of time consumption and frustration is with Power Thesaurus, the one-click Chrome extension that sits in the corner of your browser window, waiting for a word to analyze. In seconds, you‚Äôll be treated to a short list of common synonyms that can be expanded if you need to dig deeper.The settings are flexible too, allowing you to adjust the number of alternate words listed in the extension‚Äôs preview pop-up or whether or not to include antonyms as well.As online word processor apps have grown and evolved, some small-but-crucial functionality has been lost in translation, including the ability to right-click for a synonym lifeline. Power Thesaurus bridges that gap and makes writing compelling copy that much easier.Finally, we come to potentially the most controversial item on this list ‚Äî the ad blocker.Lots of content professionals still make a great deal of money through PPC advertising, so I can understand why this topic is still divisive in certain circles. Some who work in the advertising space may find themselves at a disadvantage if they use one.I‚Äôm in neither of those camps. In fact, even though I‚Äôd written my fair share of ad copy, I strongly dislike seeing them on webpages from a viewing experience standpoint.Thus, my inclusion of uBlock on my list of indispensable Chrome extensions. There are alternatives out there for this one as well, but I prefer this particular app for its minimalist feel and light CPU footprint (in other words, it won‚Äôt slow down your browser).It also cuts out the commercial portions of clips on streaming platforms like YouTube, so YAY!Note: A recent security scare concerning uBlock and other major ad blocker providers means you should do your research before making one of them part of your Google Chrome ecosystem.Those are the five free Chrome extensions that I think every blogger needs to install (if they haven‚Äôt already). Did I miss your favorite app? Is there an essential extension that I haven‚Äôt discovered yet? Let me know in the comments!",30/05/2019,2,0,3,0,875,379,2,0,0,10,105
RAIN Trading Idea of the Week: Buying the USD/CNH at 7.00,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/rain-trading-idea-of-the-week-buying-the-usd-cnh-at-7-00-9bd6196f54c,TradingRooms By Rain,95,4,550,"Two weeks ago, we published an article discussing the current, fast developing US-China Trade War. It highlighted the fact that while a trade war may feel like the right thing to get behind, it, in fact, hurts economies and can lead to devastating consequences. An example of a ‚Äútariff hungry‚Äù situation gone bad was with the passing of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which was originally introduced to help US farmers stay competitive against farmers in Europe through the imposition of tariffs on European imported agricultural goods. However, it led to a devastating trade war between the US and all of Europe in general, which prolonged the effect of the Great Depression. There are more effective means a country can use to keep its domestic constituents competitive against international forces such as the use of subsidies and imposing quotas on goods.From an economics perspective, it is fascinating to see how these types of large-scale geopolitical events can have such a large impact on the value of a nation‚Äôs currency.www.datadriveninvestor.comTrade war impacts the number of goods a country is able to sell to another country. In the context of the current US-China trade war, it‚Äôs not just that China cannot export as many goods to the United States as it used to; it‚Äôs also that China‚Äôs weakened economy impacts its relations with other countries, which in turn leads to impaired trade between these countries and the United States.An exchange rate does a great job in describing the flow of trade between the two countries. In the case of China and the US, the restriction of Chinese products into the US inevitably causes the yuan to depreciate in value against the US dollar. The reason is simple: the demand for Chinese products goes down since Chinese products are now more expensive by a factor of the corresponding tariff rate.Here‚Äôs a 10-year chart of the exchange rate between the two nations‚Äô currencies.We notice something right away: the yuan is approaching the all-important (at least, psychologically, which is of course what ultimately matters since all financial markets are driven by humans) 7.00 rate and its 10 year high. If there is enough pressure for the yuan to push through this important resistance point of 7.00, this may provide a great trade opportunity to buy the USDCNH.If there is enough pressure for the yuan to push through this important resistance point of 7.00, this may provide a great trade opportunity to buy the USDCNH.The trade could look something like this, with a 7.00 entry and a sell stop loss at the historic strong support point of 6.7.Identifying good macro trade opportunities on the foreign exchange markets can be a time consuming but highly rewarding process. At the end of the day, all you need to know is this: follow the news. Since the US is in the news and it has to do with international trade relations, volatility is going to spike in US asset classes of all types.In other words, it‚Äôs the best time to be a trader. Let‚Äôs enjoy the ride while it lasts.The author is a Co-Founder at RAIN Technologies, an AI-driven quantitative fund management company¬†in¬†India.Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the author, and do not necessarily reflect the position of Data Driven Investor.",30/05/2019,0,0,1,5,950,516,4,0,0,6,58
The Snapchat Story: And How It Managed To Stay Relevant Over The Years,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-snapchat-story-and-how-it-managed-to-stay-relevant-over-the-years-a017a2fb7a43,Adi Gandhi,60,5,800,"In the first quarter of 2019, Snapchat had 190 million daily active users(DAUs), which is greater than the population of Russia and Malaysia, combined. Snap Inc now trades at the New York Stock Exchange at $11.5(significantly low than the $24 high on the day of its IPO) a stock which gives it a $15.4 billion market capitalization. So I presume its safe to say that Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy‚Äôs baby has come a long way from their modest Stanford dorm room. But what made Snapchat tick? What did Snapchat do differently than the other thousand social media apps on the play store? Let‚Äôs look at the factors that made Snapchat what it is today.Picaboo as Snapchat was earlier known, had an eccentric cofounder in Evan Spiegel. He was the ‚Äúmain guy‚Äù from the start and everyone treated him the same. A product design major at Stanford, Evan attended only the classes he liked and couldn‚Äôt have cared less for grades. He was known to throw the most smashing dorm parties at the campus. His magnetic personality made him popular among students and professors alike. Although Evan liked to party and while-away his free time, he was a diligent worker on things he cared about.www.datadriveninvestor.com‚ÄúAn impermanent social media‚Äù was an alien concept then and Evan took upon himself to give the world its first social media app with disappearing messages. He wanted people to share with their closest friends what they‚Äôre doing at that very moment. Nobody understood the premise of the app or how to use it, but Evan banked upon word of mouth advertisement, which proved to be right after all. The thing about Evan is that he takes the biggest of decisions based on intuition, which turns out to be in his favor more often than not. He refused an offer by Mark Zuckerberg for $3 billion when Snapchat was still young. Takes some heart to refuse Zuck and then try to beat him in his own game (which he arguably did when Poke and Slingshot failed).Snapchat is still run in a very top-down fashion, as it was when it first started. Being a designer himself, Evan has always given more priority to designers and artists than engineers, which clearly reflects in the app itself. So much so, that he chose to headquarter Snapchat offices in Venice, Los Angeles over the much-hyped Silicon Valley.‚ÄúThere is a real value in sharing moments that don‚Äôt live forever.‚Äù Evan SpiegelAcquisitions have been keen for Snapchat. Throughout its history, Snapchat has gone about acquiring smaller startups aggressively. Looksery, an application software startup seamlessly integrated into the Snapchat app and gave rise to the wide array of filters or lenses we know today! Bitmoji, another application software startup provided the users with the option to make their own avatars, which quickly became popular among users. Similarly, an upstart Zenly, a location-sharing platform was acquired by Snapchat and added into its own app. Also since its inception Snapchat really hasn‚Äôt stopped innovating, taking Facebook head-on, who has quite publicly copied Snapchat‚Äôs features like Stories and Discover. Evan has time and again proved his ability to think as a user first and then as a CEO, which has proved vital over the course of Snap‚Äôs journey.The fact that Snapchat occupies the full screen on user‚Äôs phones, gives advertisers great real estate to play with. Ads on Snapchat are very interactive compared to those on Facebook or even Instagram. Snapchat has incorporated augmented reality really well and it has proved to be fruitful for advertisers. AR is Snapchat‚Äôs key point of difference currently. Also, since the last couple of years, Snapchat has started providing useful data analytics to advertisers in order for them to target ads better, not as detailed as Facebook, but it's getting there. From the start, Evan has been keen on the fact that advertisements shouldn‚Äôt come in the way of user experience, and as it turns out, they have not. Snapchat has also welcomed publishers with open arms, providing users with more quality content. All this has forced people to take Snapchat seriously and not some sort of a gimmick, as it was once portrayed by media.Although Snapchat has proved its metal, it cannot take its foot off the gas just yet. I, personally am of the opinion that the ‚Äúvertical video‚Äù play is far from over. There still is a lot to be discovered by the social media giants as well as content creators in the vertical video segment. And both Snapchat and Facebook(and it's very own Instagram) know its promise and realize the vital role it could play in the coming years and determine where the video streaming industry goes which is already on track to reach $125.5 billion by 2025. It would be interesting how this pans out!",30/05/2019,0,0,2,3,818,488,5,1,0,3,92

"An Alternative to FANG stocks, the NAMPOF ‚Äî Data Driven Investor",DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/an-alternative-to-fang-stocks-the-nampof-data-driven-investor-237f91477cb9,Daniel G. Jennings,4000,8,1550,"Many people are searching for an alternative to the FANG stocks because Mr. Market grossly overprices the FANGS. The NAMPOF could be such an alternative.To explain, FANG stands for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). Google is the popular nickname for the company now known as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL).www.datadriveninvestor.comUltimately, FANG stocks are expensive and questionable. In fact, none of the FANGS pays a dividend. Meanwhile, Netflix; which has a history of losing money, traded at $355.6 a share on 21 May 2019. Plus, Amazon was trading at $1,858.26 a share and Alphabet was trading at $1,148.94 on the same day.I call my alternative to the FANG; NAMPOF. In detail, NAMPOF stands for NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), Oracle (NYSE: ORC), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB).To explain, I fill the NAMPOF with growing tech companies I think Mr. Market undervalues. In addition, four of the six NAMPOFs; NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle. pay dividends.All of the NAMPOF companies are cash-rich. Moreover, I think each NAMPOF operates a growing platform that rakes in lots of cash. Conversely, FANG favorite Netflix burns cash like mad.Finally, there is one FANG on the NAMPOF, Facebook. Facebook is there because it makes money; operates a growing platform, and has vast amounts unrealized potential. Plus, I believe recent hysterical news stories are damaging Facebook‚Äôs reputation, but not diminishing its intrinsic value.NVIDIA is my favorite tech stock because it is more like a Warren Buffett value investment than a Silicon Valley heavyweight. To clarify, NVIDIA makes money by developing and manufacturing high-quality physical products like graphics processor units. Importantly, many of today‚Äôs hottest platforms and applications, including games, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence ( AI), and even cryptocurrency run on NVIDIA hardware.Specifically, NVIDIA reports a gross profit of $1.296 billion on revenues of $2.22 billion for the quarter ending on 28 April 2019. Plus NVIDIA reports a gross margin of 58.38%, an operating income of $358 million and a net income of $398 million for the same period.Plus NVIDIA generates a lot of cash in the form of a $720 million operating cash flow, a $1.495 billion investing cash flow, and a $592 million free cash flow on 28 April 2019. Impressively, NVIDIA had $2.772 billion in cash and equivalents and $5.03 billion in short-term investments on 28 April 2019.Plus, NVIDIA shareholders will receive a 16‚Çµ dividend on 21 June 2019. NVIDIA offered shareholders a dividend yield of 0.41%, an annualized payout of 64‚Çµ, a payout ratio of 9%, and six years of dividend growth on 21 May 2019.In the final analysis, I think Mr. Market underpriced NVIDIA at $154.2 on 21 May 2019.Like NVIDIA, Apple has a lot of non-tech attributes. Notably, it pays a dividend, generates a lot of cash and makes devices. Plus, Apple has a growing platform business. Apple TV had 25 million subscribers in March 2019, for example, Cult of Mac estimates.More importantly, Apple reports a quarterly gross profit of $21.821 billion, an operating income of $13.415 billion, quarterly revenues of $58.015 billion and a quarterly net income of $11.561 on 31 Mach 2019. Those figures allow Apple to report an operating cash flow of $11.155 billion, an investing cash flow of $13.348 billion, and free cash flow of $8.792 billion for the same quarter.Best of all Apple had $37.988 billion in cash and equivalents and $42.104 billion in short-term investments on 31 March 2019. Hence, Apple had $80.092 billion in cash and equivalents. As a result, the Apple dividend of 77‚Çµ paid on 16 May 2019 is safe.Mr. Market underpriced Apple at $185.1496 a share on 22 May 2019 making it a value investment. Hence, it is easy to see why Apple is one of the few tech stocks Warren Buffett owns through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B).I like Microsoft because it is relatively cheap, cash-rich, growing, and pays a dividend, much like Apple. Currently, the best thing about Apple is its low price; $126.74 on 22 May 2019.Microsoft owns several valuable platforms including Windows, LinkedIn, Azure, and GitHub. The business of Apps estimates 590 million people worldwide use LinkendIn, for example. GitHub is the world‚Äôs largest software marketplace with 96 million repositories, 30 million accounts, and two million organizational users, Hacker Noon‚Äôs Ake Gaviar estimates.Best of all, Microsoft makes a lot of money from its platforms. Moneys Microsoft generates from software include $30.751 billion in revenues, $20.401 billion in gross profit, $10.341 billion in operating income, and $8.809 billion income reported on 31 March 2019.Plus Microsoft rakes in vast amounts of cash in the form of $13.520 billion in operating cash flow, and $10.955 billion free cash flow on March 31, 2019. Such cash flows allowed Microsoft to accumulate the $131,618 billion in cash and equivalents it reported at the end of March 2019. Like Apple, Microsoft is a value investment and a money machine.Payment processing is very lucrative at Paypal. PayPal reports a gross profit of $1.85 billion on revenues of $4.138 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2019. Other attractive numbers at PayPal include an operating income of $518 million and a net income of $667 million on the same day.Recent cash flows of $1.027 billion (operating), $1.502 billion (financing), and $809 million (free cash flow) show PayPal is running a lot of cash through its platforms. Lots of cash also stays at PayPal in the form of $4.515 billion in cash and equivalents and $6.39 billion in short-term investments at the end of March 2019. Consequently, PayPal had $10.705 billion in cash and short-term investments in Spring 2019.PayPal‚Äôs real value; however, is in its platform which had 277 million active users at the end of 1 stQuarter 2019, Statista estimates. Growth is also high with the number of active users increasing by 17%; from 205 million to 277 million between 1 stQuarter 2018 and 1 stQuarter 2019. Even though it pays no dividend, I think PayPal is a value investment that belongs on the NAMPOF.Larry Ellison‚Äôs financial software money machine is a very lucrative tech stock most investors are unaware. Under those circumstances, I consider Oracle a classic value investment.Oracle recorded a gross profit of $7.638 billion on revenues of $9.614 billion for the quarter ending on 28 February 2019. Attractive financial numbers at Oracle include a net income of $2.45 billion and an operating income of $3.399 billion for the same period.Financial solutions generate a lot of cash at Oracle, in the form of investing cash flow of $13.199 billion, an operating cash flow of $2.861 billion, and free cash of $2.418 billion for that quarter. Oracle kept a lot of that cash in the form of $14.72 billion in cash and equivalents and $40.03 billion short-term investments on 28 February 2019. Stockrow reports Oracle had a cash stash of $40.03 billion on that day.Investors received a dividend of 24‚Çµ on 25 April 2019. That dividend grew from 19‚Çµ paid on 20 January 2019.Given these numbers, I believe Mr. Market underpriced Oracle at $54.4 a share on 22 May 2019. Oracle could be the best value investment because it is obscure, unappreciated, and undervalued.Facebook is the least appreciated of the FANG stocks but I think it has the most growth potential of that bunch. Impressively Facebook operates four of the world‚Äôs top 10 social media platforms, Statista estimates.Facebook‚Äôs mega platforms are Facebook with 2.32 billion users, WhatsApp with 1.6 billion users, Facebook Messenger with 1.3 billion users and Instagram with one billion uses. Correspondingly, Facebook owns four platforms with over a billion users each.As a consequence, Facebook has 6.22 billion users, the largest audience in history; if Statista is correct. Yet could buy a share of Facebook for $185.49 on 22 May 2019.Best of all, Facebook Facebook makes a lot of money. Impressive financial numbers at Facebook include a gross profit of $12.261 billion on revenues of $15.077 billion on 31 March 2019. Incomes include a net income of $2.429 billion and an operating income of $3.317 billion on the same day.High cash flow is another attractive feature on Facebook. Impressively, the operating cash flow was $9.308 billion on March 31, 2019. Additionally, the free cash flow was $5.471 billion on the same day.Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs social media empire pays no dividend, but it has the resources to do so. Such resources include $11.076 billion in cash and equivalents and $34.167 billion in short-term investments on 31 March 2019. Resultantly, Facebook‚Äôs cash totaled $45.243 billion on the same day.All this makes Facebook an undervalued and cash-rich company with vast amounts of growth potential, I think.Please note: I intend the NAMPOF as a suggestion and food for thought. Please, undertake your own research and think for yourself when investing.Investors should understand that there are many other potential value tech investments out there including Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) these days. Given these circumstances, I think Silicon Valley is becoming a value hunters‚Äô paradise for those willing to look carefully.Daniel G.

Customers are under-served: When a fundamental need for a customer is not met either because providing the need is too hard or requires overcoming technical/feasibility obstacles/regulatory challenges. Regulatory advancements or breakthrough in technologies opens a new market.However, it is usually the combination of both I and II that provide opportunities to disrupt at a large scale and help create a tech unicorn.

Top 5 Digital Marketing Trends You Should Be Following in 2019,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/top-5-digital-marketing-trends-you-should-be-following-in-2019-6e57374fd81d,Anthony Vallone Jr,30,5,897,"All successful marketers have a single thing in common: they always find a way to get one up on the competition. How? By analyzing and keeping up with trends that keep changing as their customers change. You don‚Äôt have to be left behind in the dust as that bandwagon rolls away. Here are some digital marketing trends that you should follow in 2019:If you have attended IT and digital marketing conferences in the last few months, you must have heard about AI in at least one of them. AI tools are used liberally today because these allow marketers to analyze customer behavior in fine detail. Once that is done, these ‚Äòrobots‚Äô make decisions according to how they are programmed.www.datadriveninvestor.comThat is work you may have to assign to your employees otherwise. With an AI software tool determining how your customers will think and act about a service/product, you can get the results you need way more quickly. In fact, depending on the software you get, these tools can also chat with customers via a chat window that can be placed directly on your website.2. 10 Second AdsOnly 9 percent of viewers will watch a 5-second video right to the end if they don‚Äôt skip ahead in the first place. Most stop watching when a minute goes by and the content does not interest them for long. In other words, the attention span of the average viewer is not that different from that of a goldfish.That is why more and more digital marketers are creating and distributing shorter, 10-second videos or snack ads to entice them. Besides the short attention span, the other reason for this is because the volume of video content online is incredibly high. Brands that want to stick out among that have to ensure their videos are creative enough but also short enough to grab attention.3. Micro InfluencersAs a digital marketer, you must be familiar with brand ambassadors and social media influencers. These individuals have close ties with big companies because they are paid to promote products on their personal profiles which usually have a huge following. Consider them as online celebrities that can amass a million followers faster than an actual celebrity can.Influencers who have that many followers are called macro influencers while those who have between 100k and 500k followers are called middle influencers. However, in 2019, micro influencers are reigning supreme. These individuals may have just 1k to 100k followers, but that is what makes them so relatable to other people.Usually, brands that want to get to know their customers intimately or want to get to the root of their complaints employ micro influencers to speak their language so to speak. They realize as should you that the best way to influence customers is to speak on their level.4. Programmatic AdvertisingManaging and distributing ads is considered to be a full-time job, but that still does not mean that you will have enough hours left in the day to complete it. This is where programmatic advertising comes into the picture. All you need to do is program AI to buy and place ads according to targeted algorithms which can make your client‚Äôs business stand out without much effort.Unlike its traditional counterpart, programmatic advertising occurs in real-time. It relies on a combination of big data, technical experts and automation to work but you will still need some human capital to make it work. This makes it a better option for brands that need mass market appeal compared to those that are looking for niche appeal.5. PersonalizationAs a digital marketer, you must already be aware of buyer personas. In other words, personalization is not an alien concept to you. Today, users are looking for custom content that can give them a more personalized experience when it comes to their purchases or potential purchases. According to Forbes, 44% of consumers say that they are likely to buy from a brand that gives them a personalized shopping experience.This is understandable if you think about it. If a customer knows that he/she is being taken care of and that their purchases are prioritized they will remain loyal and spread the word about the business as well. This translates into more revenue, increased brand consistency, and a rise in cross-channel selling opportunities.This can be anything from their name on a Starbucks cup to a small shout-out on a video message. People love knowing that the brands they are loyal to recognize and care about their experiences, something which has been noticeably absent from traditional marketing tactics.Jingles and cookie cutter ad campaigns just don‚Äôt cut it anymore today because users have gotten more knowledgeable.

Software is a value investment because Oracle makes lots of money ‚Äî Market Mad House,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/software-is-a-value-investment-because-oracle-makes-lots-of-money-market-mad-house-1cb66e68ddf6,Daniel G. Jennings,4000,5,822,"I think software is a value investment because Oracle makes lots of money. Specifically, Oracle recorded a gross profit of $7.638 billion on revenues of $9.614 for billion on 28 February 2019.Moreover, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) reported a gross margin of 79.45% for a quarter in which its revenue growth rate fell by -0.64%. To elaborate, Stockrow gives Oracle a gross margin of 79.45% and a revenue growth rate of -0.64% for 28 February 2019.www.datadriveninvestor.comHence, I estimate Oracle spent 20.45‚Çµ to make 79.45‚Çµ in the quarter ending in February 2019. Tellingly, Stockrow estimates Oracle‚Äôs Cost of Revenue for the last quarter at $1.975 billion.Finally, Oracle recorded an operating income of $3.399 billion and a net income of $2.745 billion for the quarter ending in February 2019. Oracle is making a lot of money despite falling revenue growth.I consider Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) a value investment because it generates lots of cash.For instance, Oracle recorded an investing cash flow of $13.199 billion; an operating cash flow of $2.861 billion, and free cash flow of $2.418 billion on February 28, 2019. Those cash flows enabled Oracle to accumulate $14.72 billion in cash and equivalents and $25.310 billion in short-term investments on the same day.Consequently, Oracle had access to $40.03 billion in liquid assets at the end of February. Therefore, Oracle‚Äôs cash proves software is a value investment because software suppliers can generate high cash flows and accumulate bank accounts. If you like cash you should love Oracle.Best of all, Oracle is very cheap right now. In fact, Oracle shares were trading at $51.62 on 29 May 2019 despite the cash.In my opinion, the low price makes Oracle a classic value investment because it proves Mr. Market does not appreciate the company. My guess is that investors do not understand Oracle‚Äôs product, financial software; even though they or their employers probably use and pay for it.Plus, Oracle is not a sexy company, because it makes software for banks, not killer apps, social media applications, virtual reality, or video games. Hence, there is little glamour and no gee-whiz factor at Oracle. Software for people who were suits and work in offices is lucrative, but it is not lucrative.On the other hand, many investors will appreciate the lack of drama at Oracle. The most controversial thing at Oracle is the length of CEO Larry Ellison‚Äôs yacht. Obviously, there are far worse problems a company could have.Additionally, Oracle owns and operates a massive ecosystem that most people never see. The gigantic ecosystem gives Oracle vast amounts of value, Mr. Market cannot see.Notably, Oracle claimed to have 430,000 customers and 25,000 partners in 175 countries in 2018. Interestingly, Oracle estimates its products support over 6.3 million students in 128 countries.Furthermore, Oracle claims to own over 18,000 patents worldwide. More importantly, Oracle estimates it had over one million members in 484 independent development communities in 92 countries. To that, you can add the five million estimated members in the Oracle Development Community.Beyond that, 137,000 employees and 25,000 partnerships worldwide support Oracle‚Äôs network. In detail, those employees include; 38,000 developers and engineers. Source: Oracle Fact Sheet.Oracle makes money by charging customers to use its cloud infrastructure and applications like the Oracle Autonomous Database.An autonomous database, for instance, theoretically manages itself without human supervision. You could store records from a government program or a bank‚Äôs lending programs without a large clerical staff by using the Autonomous Database.Such a database generates income for Oracle because customers pay an annual or monthly fee to use it. Hence, many of Oracle‚Äôs solutions generate what Warren Buffett likes to call float.Float is a stream of constant income that a company can tap with no strings attached. Buffett‚Äôs favorite example of the float is insurance premiums, for example.Software can generate float because; like insurance, it is a product customers constantly need. Users, moreover, need to pay a regular license fee; or subscription, to use the software legally.Suppliers of software, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Oracle, and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) make money by selling apps and other solutions organizations and individuals. Ideally, software suppliers will charge a monthly subscription or premium for those apps which leads to float.App investors should look for must-use applications; that charge a monthly or annual subscription. Strategically, Oracle‚Äôs platform offers access to many potential must-use solutions for business.A good dividend is the last of Oracle‚Äôs many benefits. ORCL paid a 24‚Çµ dividend on 25 April 2019. Attractively, that dividend grew by 5‚Çµ in 2019, rising from the 19‚Çµ paid on 30 January 2019.On 29 May 2019, Oracle shareholders were receiving a dividend yield of 1.86%, an annualized payout of 96‚Çµ, and a payout ratio of 31.3%. I think such numbers make Oracle a reliable income stock.Those looking for a safe tech stock that is a reliable moneymaker need to investigate Oracle. Financial software and database management are not sexy, but Oracle proves such applications can be very lucrative.Originally published at https://marketmadhouse.com on May 30, 2019.",30/05/2019,0,0,6,4,783,445,6,0,0,11,67
The Disruptor CMO Playbook,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/19-habits-of-successful-marketers-the-disruptor-cmo-playbook-ef5b142171a1,James Chadwick,652,20,4372,"August 2020 update ‚Äî Also check out a new essay How to Create Facebook Ads with AI in 8 stepsThe typical CMO tenure is half that of the CEO ‚Äî 3.6 years compared to 7.2 years. One of the reasons we‚Äôve seen Chief Marketers struggle for decades is that they don‚Äôt get a full mandate to disrupt. Without it, they adapt too slowly and they can‚Äôt shift the metrics that matter.Armed with more customer data and tools than ever before, it‚Äôs time for the new generation of Chief Marketers to step up and show how marketing can drive both immediate results and long-term, sustainable growth. But how?Based on my own experience at Facebook, Intel, WPP, and several startups, as well as over 50 conversations I‚Äôve had with industry experts and some of the world‚Äôs best marketers, here are the plays that Disruptor CMOs are making to build high-performance teams and get long-term results.CEOs want to build a customer-first company, and they need a strong marketing leader who can stand their ground with the Board and the C-suite ‚Äî especially Sales, Product, and Finance.The number one responsibility of a CMO is always to view the world from the outside-in, through the eyes of the customers, especially if everybody else is obsessed with fighting internal fires.Everybody thinks more marketing is a great idea‚Äîuntil it requires them to give up resources today to prioritize longer-term goals for tomorrow.The most successful CMOs get a clear mandate to assume this responsibility explicitly and relentlessly. When times get tough, they know the CEO will have their back.Before accepting an offer, a CMO must spend enough time with the CEO to understand the toughest issues, lay out an ambitious change program, and ask themselves:Will this company have the organizational patience to see through what needs to be done?For more, read Kimberly Whitler‚Äôs HBR‚Äôs article ‚ÄúThe Trouble with CMO‚Äôs‚Äù.Great companies and brands learn to express their purpose, and it‚Äôs the CMO‚Äôs job to help find it and unlock its full potential.The purpose defines how the company shows up internally with employees, and externally with customers. It is the ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô you exist, beyond just making a profit or driving shareholder value.Talented people prefer to work for companies with a clear purpose.Unilever‚Äôs former CEO Paul Polman put it best:‚ÄúPassion is when you find yourself. Purpose is when you lose yourself.‚ÄùI spent my early marketing years working on brand strategy with Unilever to help them find their brands‚Äô purpose. My client then was Alan Jope, now Paul Polman‚Äôs successor as CEO, and I was deeply impressed by his commitment to the true purpose of the Dove personal care brand ‚Äî to celebrate real, authentic beauty.Before shooting Dove TV ads, we would screen and film hundreds of real users talking about how using Dove made them feel, in search of the most authentic stories.Over time, the brand evolved to pioneer purposeful marketing (despite controversy and several missteps) as described in this Huffington Post article:‚Ä¶the Campaign For Real Beauty is one of modern marketing‚Äôs most talked-about success stories. The campaign has expanded from billboards to television ads and online videos: The 2006 video, ‚ÄúEvolution,‚Äù went viral before ‚Äúviral‚Äù was even a thing. (After all, YouTube had only launched the year before.) And Dove‚Äôs 2013 spot ‚ÄúReal Beauty Sketches,‚Äù which shows women describing their appearances to a forensic sketch artist, became the most-watched video ad of all time.The Dove Self-Esteem Project delivers self-esteem education to young people through lessons in schools, workshops for youth groups, and online resources for parents, reaching over 20 million young people across 139 countries.The aim is to make beauty a source of confidence, not anxiety.Marketing with purpose also makes good business sense: Unilever‚Äôs data shows that their portfolio brands with a ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô have grown 2x faster than those without.For more, start with Simon Sinek‚Äôs Ted Talk and dig deeper into this guide with examples.The first marketing book I read was Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind and I was hooked for life.I learned a simple business truth ‚Äî being the category leader is everything, and if a strong competitor is already positioned as number one, you should reframe a new category where you can be king.A study by HBR found that the 13 companies in the Fortune 100 that were instrumental in creating their categories accounted for 53% of incremental revenue growth and 74% of incremental market cap growth.For example, Tesla created, and now dominates, the market for luxury, long-range electric cars, and they have shown both aesthetic and performance leadership. I‚Äôm no gearhead, but even I can get excited by the idea of the Tesla Model X beating an Alfa Romeo 4C in a drag race‚Ä¶ while towing another Alfa Romeo on a trailer!Peter Thiel refreshed the idea for startups recently in his insightful Zero to One, inviting founders to look for fresh territory to create new monopolies. Direct competition drains value, while differentiation creates value as companies charge more and compete less.The CMO must bring the vision to reframe the category and lead the company to a leadership position in the market.Strong companies are powered by a flywheel effect ‚Äî positive feedback loops that build momentum, increasing the payoff of incremental effort ‚Äî and the CMO must define precisely how marketing will accelerate it.Jim Collins first described the metaphor in Good to Great: a flywheel is a heavy wheel that takes huge effort to push. Keep pushing and the flywheel builds momentum, and eventually it starts to generate its own momentum and helps turn itself.Amazon patiently adopted and perfected the concept to build a trillion dollar company.The CMO must fully understand why and how their flywheel works, and then apply focused marketing tactics to accelerate momentum:Where can the least effort make the most impact?For example, one year Amazon‚Äôs priority might be to increase choice and variety by attracting third-party sellers. Marketing should focus there. The following year, Amazon‚Äôs highest priority might be ramping customer visits to keep the sellers motivated, so marketing should shift focus.One flywheel, with many points of leverage to keep it turning.For more, start with Jim Collins 40-page 2019 update Turning the Flywheel, Andrew Chen‚Äôs essays and everything by NFX, but be careful not to conflate flywheels directly with network effects.There‚Äôs always friction between marketing, sales, and product teams, usually caused by lack of understanding, communication, and goal alignment.Disagreement is fine and healthy. In fact, at Intel, it was explicitly encoded in the culture, with signs on the walls saying, ‚ÄúWe meet to commit, not to agree.‚Äù I can still remember being (happily) shocked when my boss Rob DeLine first used the phrase, ‚ÄúOK, I disagree and commit,‚Äù to end a debate with me and move on.But companies can‚Äôt afford sustained friction, because the buyer is now in control, with more choices to compare or leave, and more access to information.Marketing must know sales, sales must know marketing, and both must know the customers.The CMO must reset expectations and align around lead definitions and scoring, Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), and a shared Revenue Funnel.Having sales and marketing within the same organization can help greatly, as does having product marketing sitting within marketing. I‚Äôm not a fan of the word Smarketing, but I applaud leaders like Stephen Burton and others for pioneering it and sharing their insights publicly.But there‚Äôs also a risk. Often when sales and marketing are combined, the result is more focus on hitting short-term sales numbers, and not enough investment to drive the long-term brand metrics that are often harder to measure.For more, start with this Marketo article and continue here.CMOs must deliver the metrics that matter to CEOs. It‚Äôs a dangerous game to only focus on the soft marketing KPIs your team can safely hit, at the risk of ignoring the hard outcome metrics the CEO is focused on.Irrelevance is death.Hubspot put together a useful cheat sheet with recommended metrics and benchmarks:One note ‚Äî LTV calculations can be misleading, especially when companies mistake this simple tool for a strategy, as outlined in Bill Gurley‚Äôs classic essay, ‚ÄúThe Dangerous Seduction of the Lifetime Value (LTV) Formula‚Äù:The fundamental reason that it is so amazingly dangerous and seductive is its simplicity and certainty. Generic marketing is conceptual. LTV marketing is specific. Building a plan to grow to a million users organically is an order of magnitude more difficult than doing it with the aid of the LTV formula.Another thing to watch out for: sales and marketing data needs to match up before it ever gets communicated to the CEO or finance, otherwise everyone gets frustrated fast.Perhaps the most defining question to answer is:What does the CEO‚Äôs dashboard look like, and which three to four marketing metrics should you as CMO be updating on it?Signing up for metrics that matter is important, but successful CMOs also learn to speak full ‚ÄòCEO Math‚Äô.There‚Äôs a suspicion that marketing is a softer, fluffier discipline, so it‚Äôs worth overcoming this perception by leaning into discussions around ROA, ROE, P/E ratios, Debt-to-Equity and various flavors of profitability.CMOs don‚Äôt need to be accountable for these metrics, but they must understand how their work impacts them.For more, review Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs take on 16 Startup Metrics, and dig into Klipfolio‚Äôs comprehensive guide.Marketing‚Äôs access to both existing and potential customers should be a source of great power within the company.CMOs must hire strong insights and analytics teams, find new ways to get everybody directly meeting and listening to users, and translate insights into great product roadmaps and marketing campaigns.Example: When Gary Briggs became Facebook‚Äôs first CMO, he understood this well from his experience at Google, eBay, and Pepsi. He hired John Fernandes and Didi Huang to build out a 100+ person Insights and Analytics team, which often spent time sharing fresh customer insights directly in the ‚Äòfishbowl‚Äô office with Mark Zuckerberg.80% of companies think they are providing a great experience, while only 8% of customers agree, and losing a customer is up to 25 times more costly than retaining them.Customer-obsessed companies like Amazon, Harley-Davidson, and Disney consistently outperform their competitors, and the CMO can drive this culture by making the voice of the user the loudest.All the data and tools exist now to make this a daily habit, as laid out in this Qualtrics eye-chart:For more, start with this Qualtrics ebook that outlines 16 ways to capitalize on customer insights.CMOs succeed by attracting world-class talent and creating a home where they can do the best work of their careers.Companies and purpose are important, but true marketers, like engineers, want to join a fearless team doing famous work together, and you have to create that home for them.The sheer complexity of the marketing discipline demands a new kind of talent profile ‚Äî the ‚ÄòJack of all trades, master of ONE‚Äô ‚Äî aka the T-shaped Marketer.For example, looking back at my own T-shaped career, I still worry that I changed tack too often and didn‚Äôt specialize enough.But as Steve Jobs said:‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.‚ÄùCertainly, looking back, I‚Äôve led several functional teams ‚Äî brand strategy, insights, media, PR, digital marketing ‚Äî and developed a far richer understanding of the overall art of marketing.The best CMOs unite people who have a detailed knowledge of their own specialty, but also bring extra skills and have a broader interest in the entire marketing mix.T-shapers respect and learn from their peers‚Äô depth, and the collaborative DNA of the group stimulates creativity.For more on why teams of T-shaped Marketers work, read this thoughtful piece.Structuring a modern marketing organization can get very complex very quickly.You must navigate naming choices (demand gen vs growth?), sales/product team overlaps, regions, in-house vs agencies, title conventions, HR considerations, etc.Successful reorgs optimize for both increased autonomy and role clarity, allowing valuable resources to become more productive.Best practice is to start by prioritizing WHAT marketing must deliver (e.g. Revenue, Growth, Brand, etc) and only then map the HOW (e.g. PR, Content, Events, etc). Strategy, then execution.Ideally, people wouldn‚Äôt get so attached to org structures ‚Äî but unfortunately they do ‚Äî so leaders must help people move on fast, with clear, lightweight communications and transparent Q&A.I‚Äôve tried to capture the core logic in this slide:For more, start with this excellent Oracle/CMO Club pdf guide, including sample charts for B2B/Consumer orgs of different sizes.Ask 100 people to define growth hacking, or growth marketing, and where it should sit in the org, and you‚Äôll get 200 answers!It‚Äôs a highly polarizing subject, with a lot of semantic debate, but one thing is clear ‚Äî growth teams have helped ramp up Facebook, Twitter, Google, Uber, and dozens of other so-called unicorn businesses, and their tactics can be studied and replicated, though not always successfully.As Andrew ‚ÄòBoz‚Äô Bosworth explains, the best product doesn‚Äôt always win, the one everyone uses wins, hence the need for growth teams.The CMO doesn‚Äôt need to be a growth hacker, but they do need a clear POV on how the tactics should be applied, and what belongs within the marketing org.Initially, back around 2010‚Äì15, the focus was on ‚Äòhacking‚Äô with small, lean teams of marketers, developers, engineers and product managers driving low-cost customer acquisition.But over time, the focus has shifted to growth marketing, with more focus on long-term sustainability. Mason Pelt describes it well:‚ÄúGrowth hacking is about optimization as well as lead generation. Imagine your business is a bucket and your leads are water. You don‚Äôt want to pour water into a leaky bucket; it‚Äôs a waste of money. That‚Äôs why a true growth hacker would care about customer retention.‚ÄùIn other words, first solve for fuel efficiency, then fill the tank.My personal bias is that the growth marketing experts sit within the marketing org, but are deployed with a high degree of autonomy to work across the company on very specific business challenges, optimizing creatively and aggressively against a single metric.When that‚Äôs fixed, everybody cheers and they move on to fix the next burst pipe!To learn more (and we all probably need to), start with the essays of Brian Balfour, Andrew Chen, Sean Ellis, and Casey Winters or check out more content from their joint Reforge program.CMOs must have a clear idea about when to optimize and when to innovate, and blend the two modes together to create an optimal effect.Andy Johns has laid out this logic comprehensively and with data in an excellent essay ‚ÄúA Balanced Approach to Growth‚Äù based on scaling Facebook, Twitter, Quora, and Wealthfront as President.Optimization is when a company iterates on its existing products or services to squeeze more juice out of the orange, typically incremental in nature (e.g. 5‚Äì10% gains).Innovation is when a company embarks on building entirely new products or services for existing customers or for a new segment of customers, leading to exponential gains (e.g. 2x‚Äì10x).Like a balanced investment portfolio, companies need both, and must design the appropriate types of tests for their stage.Smaller startups can‚Äôt test like big companies because of sample size limitations, and they need big jumps. They must test big changes to their product in order to manage sample size limitations.Also, the bottom half of a funnel is often a better place to test than the top half of a funnel because obtaining statistical significance on a high baseline conversion rate is more likely than on a low baseline conversion rate.A marketing technology stack is the group of technologies marketing uses to:In 2018, it became the number one marketing budget line-item (29%) according to Gartner, and the CMO (not the CIO) needs to roll up their sleeves and get dirty with the data to invest in the right stack and talent to run it.If done early and well, the right martech can pay for itself by reducing the need for headcount growth.Some marketing teams organically adopt 50+ technologies, so smart consolidation is often needed.For B2B companies, Account-Based Marketing (ABM) systems are top of the 2019 implementation list, offering valuable tools to align sales and marketing teams around the same data and funnel.For more, start here with Intercom‚Äôs Ultimate guide to Martech Stacks and see a real example. Also spend time yourself reviewing the analysis based on 750k user reviews at www.G2.com. And if you‚Äôre proud of your new stack, you can even enter it for an award in the Stackies. Yup, that‚Äôs a thing.With new channels and more data and martech tools, it‚Äôs too easy to forget that strong, bold creative can still drive 10x performance deltas.Most CEOs are more comfortable with numbers than ideas, so CMOs must use data to demonstrate the business value of strong creative.But then they must both demand bold work from teams and agencies, and inspire trust by defending the ideas through to successful launch and beyond.If agencies or in-house teams are still thinking TV-first, a CMO can insist on ‚Äòno mobile, no meeting‚Äô, and demand to see ideas that leverage new targeting data to drive personalization at scale.But ultimately, great mobile creative is just great creative, grounded in a powerful idea.For more, review industry meta studies that quantify the impact of creative vs media effects, and enjoy this list of 18 classic campaigns with examples and context.As Ben Horowitz puts it:‚ÄúCompanies that don‚Äôt have a clearly articulated story don‚Äôt have a clear and well thought-out strategy. The company story is the company strategy.‚ÄùThe chief marketer also needs to be the chief storyteller, crafting a strong narrative arc and a detailed message architecture.My former colleague Jayant Murty gives a great reminder about the need for authentic, believable stories:‚ÄúStorytelling is not just about your nice side, it‚Äôs about ‚Äòyour all-sides.‚Äô There are parts of the story they may not like, but you can still tell them what you are doing about it. Every villain has a heroic streak and every hero has a villainous streak ‚Äî that‚Äôs what makes for interesting stories and believable ones over time.‚ÄùBut the data shows that today‚Äôs great companies must also become storydoers, showing up in the world and making a real difference.Red Bull is an extraordinary example of a company in a low-interest energy drink category that replaces traditional advertising with storydoing, showing the Red Bull ethos by staging high-adrenaline sporting events and breaking through the barriers of human potential.Red Bull now sells seven billion cans a year, roughly one for each human being on little-old-earth!For more, read the book True Story, a classic HBR article ‚ÄúGood Companies are Storytellers. Great companies are storydoers,‚Äù but also a recent article in Fast Company underlining the need to back up purpose with action.Great companies know how to preserve the core AND stimulate progress.Disruptor CMOs often use the 70‚Äì20‚Äì10 framework to ensure teams prioritize both proven methods and tests for new growth opportunities.For example, Coca-Cola uses a 70% Now, 20% New, 10% Next framework to prioritize content development. The 70% Now budget is expected to deliver predictable results; the 10% experimental budget assumes a higher risk/reward target.The model can also be applied to product innovation and channel selection, especially important in light of Andrew Chen‚Äôs ‚ÄúLaw of the Shitty Clickthroughs,‚Äù which states that over time, all marketing strategies result in lower returns.The first banner ad ever, on HotWired in 1994, debuted with a clickthrough rate of 78%. Today, average CTRs are around 0.05%, a 1,500x decline!Successful ‚Äò10%‚Äô experiments are valuable, but be wary of models extrapolated from marketing metrics done at a small scale, because these arbitrage opportunities disappear fast.For more, read how marketers are using 70‚Äì20‚Äì10.The most important recent marketing innovations have come from a new generation of digital native companies, and it‚Äôs essential to study the new breed of marketers from Marketplace, DTC, and SaaS companies.This is where the real innovation is happening.Starting with Marketplaces, according to seed and early-stage VC NFX, network effects have been responsible for 70% of all the value created in technology since 1994.Think eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and dozens of others.Marketers must understand how Marketplaces work, and there‚Äôs now no shortage of insightful theory and practical advice about how best to scale 2-sided and N-sided markets.For example, in his classic essay ‚ÄúThe Next 10 Years Are All About Market Networks,‚Äù five-time founder and NFX MD James Currier defines ‚ÄòMarket Network‚Äô to describe a new kind of market, with multiple participants, SaaS tools, with transactions at the center:1) Market networks target more complex services. 2) People matter ‚Äî complex services mean each client is unique and not interchangeable. 3) Collaboration happens around a project. 4) There‚Äôs unique profiles of people involved. 5) Long term relationships between participants. 6) Referrals flow freely. 7) Increases transaction velocity and satisfaction.Not all network effects are the same, however, and understanding the nuances is essential for building network effects of your own into your products. To help, NFX has identified 13 different kinds of network effects.Meanwhile, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) companies like Dollar Shave Club have built and sold disruptive billion dollar CPG businesses in a few years, using Facebook ads, edgy videos, and subscription models.More recently, Hims is now disrupting the Wellness industry by destigmatizing erectile disfunction and other sensitive medical issues, making telemedicine accessible and a fresh new creative approach.Finally, B2B SaaS companies like Slack, Zoom, InVision, and Dropbox have shown that anybody with a superior product can now disrupt the classic IT sales playbook by getting bottoms-up traction with users, and exploiting workplace viral loops to scale up organically first, making the Enterprise sales conversation a whole lot easier.In fact, arguably the Consumer vs Business tech marketing model has reversed, with consumer tech innovation being stifled by the larger FAANG companies, just as the SaaS API companies have blown open the Enterprise tech opportunity for whoever has the best product and smartest marketing.SaaS companies are essentially financializing software: instead of selling software as a product with a sticker price, it sells the software as if it were a financial instrument, with a probabilistically forecastable cash flow.This in turn has led to prolific marketing innovation, especially around LTV:CAC ratios, freemium and price bundling, building platforms, and lower funnel conversion tactics.Big and small are collapsing. Big traditional companies are often just a collection of small brands and marketing units with limited budgets who must all learn to ‚Äòact small‚Äô.And in reverse, successful Marketplace, DTC and SaaS players grow fast and suddenly need to act big, and get their heads around the ROI of spending $5m+ on a 30-second Superbowl ad.For some fun, check out Squatty Potty‚Äôs outrageously successful DTC films, watched over 100m times, with 5m+ potties sold!Working at Intel, it was mandatory to lead fast and frequent debriefs.In that culture, you never made the same mistake twice because the second time you made it, it wasn‚Äôt a mistake, it was a choice. A bad choice.By contrast, at Facebook, we moved fast, and we often broke things, but we rarely debriefed. As the company has grown it‚Äôs become an issue, and the culture is changing now.A CMO should lead large project debriefs and use them to reward the growth mindset. Keep it lightweight and simple, focusing on four questions:I had the privilege to sit on Sheryl Sandberg‚Äôs leadership team and learn how she and our Head of Diversity, Maxine Williams, interpreted diversity issues.This included publishing an annual diversity report and implementing the diverse slate approach (DSA), which ensures that hiring managers will consider candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.Like all great leaders, Sheryl understood that repetition never spoils the prayer, and as the company grew by a factor of ten, she never stopped repeating the same truth:The best way to harness the positive potential of technology is to have more people in the room with different voices and different views.It‚Äôs also good business. A study run by McKinsey examined 180 companies across four countries and found that diverse boards (defined as those including women and foreign nationals) perform better ‚Äî generating 53 percent higher returns on equity than the companies in the bottom diversity quartile.Given the external focus of marketing, CMOs especially must build diverse teams, but also go further to become an ally to everyone who needs it, and guide others to do the same. Valuable guidance can be found at the Guide to Allyship.Through my career, I‚Äôve been blessed with strong, caring managers. But in the earlier days, when managers gave feedback, they mainly focused on weaknesses, and what you should improve.I definitely benefited from the advice.But having tried it both ways as a manager, I‚Äôve found that a strengths-based approach gets more consistent results.The idea is simple:People will grow strongest where they are already strong.For example, Tiger Woods‚Äô first coach said Tiger was number one driving a ball 400-yards down the fairway, but was #69 getting out of a sand bunker. But in practice they never focused on getting out of the traps; they kept the focus on his strength of driving down the fairways, and avoiding the bunkers altogether.Marcus Buckingham describes the opportunity for managers:‚ÄúIdentify a person‚Äôs strengths. Define outcomes that play to those strengths. Find a way to count, rate or rank those outcomes. And then let the person run.‚ÄùWe must keep in mind what a strength actually is. The best culture coach I knew was Michael Ronglien at Facebook, who reminded us that there can be things you‚Äôre good at, but make you weaker, and there can be things you‚Äôre not good at yet, that give you energy and make you feel stronger. These are strengths.I prefer to give performance reviews in reverse to my direct reports. In other words, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a few areas of improvement, but let‚Äôs spend our time focusing on the strengths you can leverage even more...‚ÄùGreat CMOs hire rockstars and help them play on ever bigger stages.For more, start with Marcus Buckingham‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Business Case for Strengths‚Äù. While on culture, also read Mike Ronglien‚Äôs excellent book This is Now Your Company.There‚Äôs never been a more exciting or challenging time to be a CMO.Many of the old lines are blurring between sales and marketing, B2C and B2B, art and science. Blurring breeds creativity.I‚Äôm grateful to all the generous career marketing mentors I‚Äôve had and the new ones I‚Äôm still discovering. I hope I can be as useful to others as they have been to me.May these 19 ideas help you on your marketing journey.Pick one and put it into action today.",30/05/2019,7,0,34,17,889,679,17,2,0,68,1920

Please Get A College Degree,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/please-get-a-college-degree-3d03783d6b23,Jocelyn Uasal,135,6,1206,"Hey, yeah, uhhh, what the f**k? I‚Äôm sorry but here‚Äôs the thing, I am throwing the best years of my life away to still be $1,600 in debt? And, last time I checked, I wasn‚Äôt really ever asked if I‚Äôd like to participate either. And with the general agreement of the people around me, I would say that none of my peers have been asked either. An entire generation - actually no, an entire nation being forced to their knees to work until the very edge of their lives usually for corporations they don‚Äôt care about in a job that doesn‚Äôt satisfy them. When I am imagining ‚Äúmy America‚Äù I must be honest when I say that it does not involve hating my work.Whenever I bring up this topic I‚Äôll, at least once or twice, get someone who bats back that I am simply a lazy millennial who won‚Äôt shut up about wanting free stuff. Here‚Äôs my problem with that too often repeated argument. Have these people ever read an older, popular book before? Like? Ever? 1984, The Jungle, even The Great Gatsby and Silent Spring all have notes of anti-capitalist propaganda in it? Wanting to not kill myself and waste my life to hardly survive, unsurprisingly, has attracted the people most hurt by these systems, yet still, these ideas seem so demonized. I must admit that it is not the work that I hate, but the medium in which I must submit.www.datadriveninvestor.comAlongside work, I volunteer a bit of my time, and during the fall and spring semesters, I‚Äôm also a student of English. Now volunteering specifically, providing help to my community without expecting anything in return, is something that I absolutely feel to be a worthwhile part of my time. Working with a company that I don‚Äôt care about (I mean, who really feels good about working in a casino?) is like driving a knife into myself. Yet, almost every day I get out of bed too early, put on an outfit that I don‚Äôt like, and deal with hundreds of people that are rude to me (gotta love customer service.)Now, I hope I am not coming off like I am just complaining about my job. There are plenty of things that I like, usually either some nice customers or the rare occasions that I get tipped, they also even helped me professionally get through my transition. Though, still, having a nice job is not the point, for being forced to keep a job at all is the immortal bit. Every day I collect my business about $60k, which is an enormous amount of money for one woman, and that‚Äôs just the hotel side for it is said that the casino triples our profits, yet monthly I make about $1,300. My monthly bills being about $920.This ballad, especially if you live in America, is a song we can all sing. Running the hamster wheel of capitalism and being told that if we just run that much harder we might get somewhere. In all the time I‚Äôve worked at this place, however, and in pretty much everywhere else, there is always one common outlier of workers. Those with degrees. They are the freest to do whatever they like and make the most money, regardless of actual experience. Mainly in my field, there are hospitality degrees, but I work alongside those with accounting degrees, English degrees, even biology degrees and while they don‚Äôt really get to use that knowledge what they do gain is absolute freedom from their job. A chance for a career. The difference between myself and them is that if I decide to leave I might just end up making the same amount of money, maybe less, or maybe even more but not by a fantastic amount. If they decide tomorrow to pack up and leave, their options are plenty, for their knowledge is needed all across the country.I say this not to belittle those of the low skill workforce, but to reexamine the importance of higher education. Growing up, I‚Äôm sure most of us were told that we absolutely regardless of anything have to go to college no matter what. At least I know that I was, but just like anything life gets in the way. We get married, get a job to pay the bills, go out drinking to forget the work week, repeat, repeat, repeat. Forgetting to go to college is too easy to do, so let me take the wheel and be the one to look you in the eyes to tell you right now that you need to go back. We all do. Regardless of what your desired degree is or what you want to do, accomplishing this feat is one you shall never regret. While I say this, I understand that many people‚Äôs gut reaction will be why they can‚Äôt go back to school, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs all bullshit.School is too much money? Apply to your local community college, get your FASFA and get your butt over there. FASFA usually pays for every cent of community if you qualify, hell I usually walk away with more money than I spend.College will take away too much of your time? Then only take a few classes, or take some night/weekend classes instead. College does take time to deal with, but its difficulty (especially in Jr. College) is often overstated. Until finals come up you may just find that instead of drowning in work you‚Äôre spending your time learning just why you¬†enrolled. And if you‚Äôre not careful, you might even enjoy yourself along the way.And, to top it all off, the worst excuse I‚Äôve ever heard is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine where I am in life, I don‚Äôt need college.‚Äù Out of everything above this is the one that really gets me. They want to improve yourself and to never settle is a human desire, at least I thought so. I mainly see this thrown around by older adults rather than millennials or gen zed kids, which I think is understandable to a point. If you‚Äôve gone decades settling and you hear me, a young, overly optimistic liberal, telling you to change your whole life around, you are going to think me naive. Or at the very least, quite annoying. Yet still, there is never going to be a time where you shouldn‚Äôt improve yourself. Sure, you‚Äôre fine with your 9-5 office job, but if you‚Äôve always wanted to be a zookeeper or a teacher then why the hell would you stop yourself?Look. There is never going to be a good time to go back to school. I would also argue that there‚Äôs no good reason to stay in a dead-end job you‚Äôre not content with. In all of us, there is a burning feeling to do something more than us and to create a world that is better than before us. Increasingly, that is getting harder and harder to do, but in a society that is becoming increasingly more educated the chips are starting to move our way. While we are held to work for these awful corporations, it seems ever more true that the more we are worth, the less we can be torn down.",30/05/2019,0,0,3,8,933,486,3,0,0,6,30
Why Brands Should Pay Attention to Instagram‚Äôs Latest Shoppable Feature,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-brands-should-pay-attention-to-instagrams-latest-shoppable-feature-55a41194c989,Emily Trenouth,19,4,622,"Instagram‚Äôs new shopping feature is sure to be a game-changer for brands.The innovative in-app checkout feature allows users to store their payment information and make purchases in the app, while brands and businesses can sell their products directly to their target audience.This means you can activate your consumers while they scroll, browse and buy with next-level convenience and ease, capturing them at peak interest as soon as they‚Äôve seen your product ‚Äî a marketer‚Äôs dream come true.With over 130 million Instagram users now tapping to reveal product tags in shopping posts every month, up from 90 million in September, it‚Äôs a no-brainer for brands to leverage this increased engagement by encouraging more action-oriented buying behaviour.By tagging their products in creator content, rather than taking users off-platform, brands can combine the best aspects of online shopping and influencer marketing to create an online super-strategy.So what do Instagram shopping tags mean for your brand?Accurately measuring the ROI of influencer marketing has always been a friction point for brands.At the end of 2017, 76% of marketers said that the biggest influencer marketing challenge for 2018 would be determining their campaign ROI, and 90% said that they only used engagement rates to assess the success of their influencer marketing campaign.The truth is that there are many ways to measure the success of influencer marketing, some of which aren‚Äôt easily quantifiable, and Instagram‚Äôs new checkout feature will actually allow brands to attribute sales conversion to each influencer post. Mind-blowing!Statistics show that people trust the recommendations of an influencer they follow more than any other form of advertising. In fact, 70% of millennial consumers are influenced by the recommendations of their peers in buying decisions, and 30% of consumers are more likely to buy a product recommended by a non-celebrity blogger. Why?Consumers want to hear from other consumers. This is largely due to their trustworthiness, their relatability and the fact that their followers value their opinion more highly than a celebrity or brand.Now, not only will your customers be able to browse for product inspo, they‚Äôll also be able to buy without even having to leave the app. This means that brands can tap into consumers‚Äô purchase intent while they‚Äôre at their most inspired, most interested, and most activated.Imagine if you could empower your own customers to not only create your marketing for you ‚Äî but to buy AND sell from each other? The sky is truly the limit!As Mark Schaefer says in his article on regulating social influencers:‚ÄúOur job is to sell more shit. And influencers sell shit. They do. No question. In some industries, they sell shit better and faster than any advertising program in the history of the world. A single Instagram post from some influencers can change a business. It can change an industry.‚ÄùReferencing a friend‚Äôs rejection of influencers after the famed FYRE Festival disaster, the impact of influencer marketing is undeniable. And for legitimate brands with legitimate products, Instagram is about to close the sales loop in a marketing channel proven to be more powerful than traditional mediums. If influencers can deliver sales by driving people off-platform and through multiple clicks to purchase, imagine what‚Äôs possible with the introduction of the big blue button.As of now, Instagram isn‚Äôt going to monetize influencers for sales through affiliate links meaning that influencers may need to raise their post prices if they‚Äôre including shoppable tags. And due to the usual one-brand-exclusivity of sponsored posts, brands will also be fighting for ‚Äòinfluencer real estate‚Äô, driving up demand and making prices more competitive. This means brands will need to devise a slick strategy to maximize yield from this feature.Who knows where this new feature will lead the industry, but in the meantime, here‚Äôs everything you need to know‚Ä¶",30/05/2019,0,0,6,2,700,595,2,1,0,1,203
How to Advertise the Disgusting,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-advertise-the-disgusting-8f24b5d7038d,Flo Furem,1200,5,1073,"If your product or service is not what they call ‚Äúsexy,‚Äù the marketing world will probably exclude you from all the social media fun, right? Wrong.Just because customers associate your offering with pain, fear, or disgust, you don‚Äôt have to step away from marketing altogether. If you approach marketing from the right angle, you can advertise a blocked toilet just as well as a decorating service.Here‚Äôs how I know.We had been hearing weird noises for quite some time, but we never really saw anything. So it was hard to react adequately.After almost half a year, I saw a rat on the roof. I‚Äôd never been happy to see a rat before, but in this case, it was a relief. I could finally do something about that nagging noise that kept me awake every night.Since the rats were in a crawlspace, we weren‚Äôt too excited to have them as houseguests. There are lots of wires and pipes up there. It‚Äôs not an environment where you want someone sniffing and gnawing around.We called an exterminator and he ‚Äútook care of things.‚Äù I‚Äôm noticing this story sounds more and more like an episode of the Sopranos.Anyway, we were happy; the rats, not so much. And as you do when you have someone over ‚Äî be that a handyman or an exterminator ‚Äî you talk about your jobs. So I mentioned that I work as a copywriter.He, in turn, mentioned that he had problems with his website, so I was glad to give him some advice.I had a look at his online presence and he was actually quite active, posting videos on Facebook and well-informed articles on his website.However, there was one problem. His advertising was upside down.Not only was he working as an exterminator, but he also offered a decluttering service. So his marketing efforts were not exactly for those with a weak stomach. He walked through filthy apartments full of garbage, maggots, and rodents. Yummy!But that‚Äôs what he does for a job, right? So how could he turn his marketing into something that wouldn‚Äôt make people click away like a poo-rating website?Well, he hasn‚Äôt implemented all of my advice yet, but here‚Äôs what I told him. I think this advice will work for lots of other industries where the product isn‚Äôt really ‚ÄúInstagrammable‚Äù or sexy.His first problem was obvious: He was only showing the apartments before he had done his job. Now, there is some merit to that. A picture says a thousand words, as we all know. And with some of these apartments, a thousand wouldn‚Äôt have been enough.He was clearly targeting landlords suffering from the damages that rental nomads had left behind. And that‚Äôs a big market, so his target group was not the problem.Also, he was already following the advice you hear from marketing experts all around the planet: Document, don‚Äôt create.When you listen to Gary Vaynerchuk, Neil Patel, or many others, they all recommend the same strategy. You won‚Äôt have such a hard time filling your editorial calendar if you just document what you already do every day.In some cases, that‚Äôs why upcoming marketers or writers have such a hard time advertising. They simply haven‚Äôt done enough yet that‚Äôs worth mentioning.So he was documenting his job ‚Äî perfect. But what was the problem?He wasn‚Äôt showing the ‚Äúafter.‚Äù I never saw a picture of a clean apartment that he left after finishing his work.And to some extent, that made sense. ‚ÄúWhy should I show a clean apartment? It‚Äôs boring. My customers know what a normal apartment looks like.‚ÄùTrue. But you‚Äôre misrepresenting your own services if you just show the problem and not the solution.What he didn‚Äôt understand is a very fine nuance. An exterminator doesn‚Äôt sell advice on bees‚Äô and rats‚Äô behavior. He sells a solution to an everyday problem. He‚Äôs not a biologist.So, instead of just showing the filthy apartments, I recommended he show before-and-after pictures. Also, I told him not to show two-minute videos of the apartment before, but rather a one-minute clip divided into 30 seconds each for before and after.This applies to many professions, including plumbers, locksmiths, and tow services. I‚Äôm not saying they all solve ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù problems. But the fact that many of the exterminator‚Äôs customers were disgusted or afraid shows how marketing efforts are often upside down.Would you rather see an ad of someone waiting on a highway for hours, or a one-minute clip of a car being towed right away so the customer could make it to his urgent appointment?Would you prefer a Facebook ad with an image of a blocked toilet, or one where the enthusiastic housewife or househusband reports that the plumber left the bathroom even cleaner than it was before?Would you prefer a video of a student locking himself out of his apartment, or one where he finds out that the quickest key service also offers a reduced rate?Sell a solution to a problem, answer a desperate customer. Don‚Äôt show him pictures of Freddy Krueger when he has trouble falling asleep.But there is one case where just showing the negative side of your service may come in handy.One thing I loved about said exterminator‚Äôs website was the way he educated visitors and future customers about different kinds of vermin.In this case, it can be helpful to (also) mention the negative, simply because it‚Äôs what customers are already Googling.So, staying with the exterminator example, it will greatly benefit you and your business to explain the rats‚Äô or bees‚Äô behavior. I can tell you my mom finally had a good night‚Äôs sleep after she knew that the rats wouldn‚Äôt crawl into her bed at night to cuddle.Many tools can help you to find out what questions customers have said about your field of expertise.From Google‚Äôs search console and keyword planner to Ubersuggest or Answer the Public, use these tools to find out what customers want to know. You may acquire a new customer just by answering a question that seems trivial to you.But also look out for balance in your content, especially if your service is attached to something that the general public is afraid of or considers disgusting. Don‚Äôt just mention the damages that rodents leave behind. Instead, also mention when you don‚Äôt need to worry. Give some level of comfort to concerned customers looking for answers in a panic.Trust me, you will win a loyal and thankful customer at some point. And even if you don‚Äôt, karma points are pretty nice too.",30/05/2019,1,0,17,23,1050,700,1,0,0,6,139
Leadership Principles Learned From a Master Butcher,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/a-butchers-lessons-on-leadership-a9a8b50f0167,Alex Carabi,278,6,1253,"Last week, I spent three days in Columbia, Missouri, for the inaugural edition of Capital Camp, hosted by One of the morning activities took place on a picturesque farm. Overlooking the rolling hills below, we learned the basics of butchery from the master Michael Sullivan.On the bus ride back into town, Dhani Jones and I discussed what we had learned. The more we talked, the more insights we realized we had gained.These lessons apply to the kitchen. But, more importantly, they also apply to mastery, leadership, and life.A pig is an investment. You purchase it from a producer, with the goal of selling the butchered pieces of meat for more than you bought it for. You generate a profit by adding value.So the more of the pig you can use, the more you can earn.A butcher with a charcutier background like Mike Sullivan will use every single piece of the pig. He turns sinew into salami, kidney fat into soap, he even transforms ears and skin into ‚Äúskin noodles‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt let anything go to waste.Everything‚Äôs an offer, if you dare to look past convention.An employee is an investment. You hire people with the goal of maximizing their potential. As a leader, you support that process by creating the right conditions for them to bloom and thrive. By bringing more of their potential out, you leverage their value and add value to the business.This requires allowing the whole human to come to the table. A human being is more than one‚Äôs well-formed strengths ‚Äî it includes one‚Äôs quirks, fears, and shadow sides, too.It can take a psychologically safe environment to feel comfortable enough to show all sides of oneself. But the integrative and aligned mindsets that result lead to a range of better outcomes. As Carl Jung pointed out, if we avoid our shadow sides, they ‚Äúwill only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive.‚ÄùInside of fighting against ourselves by trying to fit into molds, leadership of the highest order allows people to get more in touch with themselves. As biologist Francisco Varela states: ‚ÄúThe way to make a biological system more healthy is connect more of it to itself.‚ÄùThat means using it all, ears and sinews included.It‚Äôs essential for a butcher to grasp the tools of the trade. Knives, cleavers and saws vary in their size, strength, nimbleness, sharpness, and weight. Each tool has its place and use.A tool‚Äôs effectiveness depends on its history and origin. Take Japanese knives, for example. Back when the traditions of knife-making emerged, large animals didn‚Äôt inhabit the country. Japanese knives were designed for handling smaller animals like fish and poultry.Germany, in contrast, has always had an abundance of cows and pigs. Their knives became well-adapted for big bones and thick cuts of meat.Even to this day, German knives are more suited for larger animals, and Japanese knives for smaller ones.A butcher has a limited amount of variables to play with, so using the right tool is key. When cutting meat off the bone, a small and flexible boning knife is appropriate. Any urges to impress onlookers with massive cleavers are put to one side. A butcher won‚Äôt use an ax just because it‚Äôs larger and it seems more powerful. A butcher will use the right tool for the job.And those tools will always be kept sharp. A butcher never stops honing his blades.A butcher‚Äôs tools are knives, saws, and cleavers. A pianist‚Äôs tool is the piano. A painter‚Äôs tool is the paintbrush.But what is the tool of a leader?You are your leadership tool. That means knowing the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs of how you function. Your history and the story you tell yourself about yourself. What drives you and what triggers you. What causes you to get annoyed, and what makes you feel threatened.This self-knowledge lets you know which blade of leadership is applicable for a given situation. You don‚Äôt scream and dominate when a more sensitive, empathetic approach is called for. Domineering and controlling might inflate the ego, but they‚Äôre rarely the right tool for the job at hand.Constant and continuous self-awareness is the sharpening of your knife. By leaning into every moment with the intention of learning about yourself and perfecting your craft, you‚Äôre polishing your blade of leadership.When you think of ribs, odds are it‚Äôs the baby back variety that come to mind. You‚Äôd think they are tastiest, most tender type of ribs, right?Wrong. Baby back ribs come from high up of the pig, close to the spine and the loin. They have low fat content and a short length (the name referring to the size of the bone, not the age of the pig).St. Louis-style spare ribs are much longer and flatter due to their placement further down towards the belly. They have more meat on the bone, and by all accounts they‚Äôre more flavorful and tender.So why are the inferior baby back ribs more expensive than spare ribs? Because of marketing.Food producers and manufacturers put marketing muscle behind baby backs because, not despite, they have less taste and meat. With a cute and approachable name, they stick in your mind, and even bring up associations of tender veal. The industry deliberately turned a weaker product into a more marketable offering.And they‚Äôre still laughing and licking their lips all the way to the bank.As noted above, weaknesses and shadow sides can wreak havoc if they‚Äôre not welcomed to the table. But if you‚Äôre able to recognize and work with those aspects, then alignment and flow will follow.With the right marketing, those weaknesses can even be turned into strengths of their own.By first acknowledging weaknesses, you‚Äôre then ready to find opportunities and contexts where they can be of greater use. It‚Äôs product-market fit, and lateral thinking with withered technology, applied to people.Marketing is the act of creating and communicating meaning. A weakness can be turned into a marketable strength by weaving a narrative that transforms its meaning.Take the example of Milton Erickson, the influential psychiatrist and psychologist. When he was 17 he contracted polio. Paralyzed throughout his entire body except his eyeballs, he was confined to bed for months on end. This didn‚Äôt stop his medical career. It allowed him, even forced him, to observe people‚Äôs behaviors more closely. Day after day he watched his eight siblings interact, picking up the subtleties and nuances in their mannerisms. Soon he became an unrivaled master in perceiving body language and nonverbal communication, from which he built his career.Not only did he turn his initial weakness into a competitive advantage, he turned it into a marketing hook in and of itself. He spun a captivating narrative throughout the rest of his career, never failing to recount stories of when he was paralyzed in bed as a youngster.He wasn‚Äôt just a psychologist. He was the once-paralyzed psychologist who overcame life-threatening polio. He wove a narrative that set him apart from the crowd. And that made him remarkable.Josh Wolfe, another participant and speaker at Capital Camp, has alluded to this:‚ÄúProgress comes from change. And change comes from discontent. That source of discontent? It might come from childhood, tragedy or troubles, rivalry or revenge, a grudge, a quest to disprove doubters‚Ä¶.the bad stuff can often lead to the good stuff.‚ÄùHelping people to take that bad stuff and turn it into good stuff is leadership alchemy of the highest order. It takes people‚Äôs discarded, neglected assets and transforms their meaning into gold.Just like the baby back.",30/05/2019,1,0,4,5,1050,700,1,0,0,13,147
Pinocchio The Marketing Expert,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/marketing-for-honest-people-b2044a51bd26,Alli Graham,10,5,1064,"Alice put the phone down and turned to talk to the Dragon.‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure about this?‚Äù she asked.The Dragon nodded and said, ‚ÄúApparently, he‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù said Alice. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give it a go then.‚ÄùThree weeks later, Alice opened the castle‚Äôs front door to greet her guest: world-renowned marketing expert, Pinocchio.Pinocchio walked into the castle, shook Alice‚Äôs hand, and then proceeded to tell her what he‚Äôd done with his own castle. He told her all about the interior designers that he had employed to bring it back from its shell-like state. Then, he told her about the number of guests who were lining up to spend the night and paying through the nose for the privilege.He spent an hour telling her all about the marketing campaigns that he had run for famous people. Then, he told her how much he was now able to charge per hour because he got such incredible results.She was actually already aware of this, having paid his invoice upfront and in full.And then he told about all the people who were waiting to work with him. He told her how lucky she was that he had felt moved to put far more important and influential people to one side, so he could come and help her in her hour of need.Alice tried to get a word in edgeways to say thank you. But as soon as she opened her mouth, he was off again. Showing her pictures of his latest holiday that he‚Äôd flown to in his own private jet. Then, he showed her the Rolls-Royce that picked him up from the airport. And the chauffeur. And the drinks bar in the back of the car.Alice tried again to speak, but he cut her off, holding his hand up to silence her. He told her all about where he‚Äôd come from. That he hadn‚Äôt started out a real boy, oh no! When he was younger, he‚Äôd lived a hard life with a very impoverished single parent and he‚Äôd fallen in with a bad crowd‚Ä¶Alice was, by now, trying her very best to make polite noises of interest. However, she was beginning to wonder if they‚Äôd ever get round to talking about her marketing problems. You know, the ones he was being paid to solve.She noticed something as he was waving yet more photographs of tropical islands in her face and pontificating about how important authenticity and integrity were when it came to the marketing business.She noticed a very small red bird.Now one of the things that few people know about Alice was that she was a confirmed twitcher. She was a birdwatcher, and she didn‚Äôt care who knew it. It was partly because she was a bit of a nerd, but mostly because she felt obliged to act as a lookout ‚Äî because of the Dragon when he was out searching for ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù. His idea of fast food tended to be whatever sat on the nearest branch, combined with his own fiery breath. She honestly tried to save everyone, but she was especially diligent with the really rare ones.And this little red bird was a really rare one.So rare, in fact, that the only place it lived was in a slightly rundown town about 30 miles from the castle, which is a long way from the tropical island that Pinocchio claimed to have just visited.Alert to this discrepancy, Alice started to look more closely at the pictures he was flashing in her face. They‚Äôd moved to his Instagram feed now, and as he scrolled through the dozens of posed and filtered images, Alice began to see a common theme emerging.She held up her hand to stop him. Now normally, Alice would never dream of being this rude, but she was on the clock, and the clock was expensive. Pinocchio stopped mid-sentence, astonished that someone would have the temerity to interrupt his flow of wisdom.Alice looked him in the eye. ‚ÄúAnd these are all real, you say?‚ÄùPinocchio blustered, ‚ÄúOf course they are, dear girl!‚Äù‚ÄúAnd not green screens?‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúOr rented?‚ÄùPinocchio opened his mouth to protest, but the look on Alice‚Äôs face stopped him in his tracks.He took a slightly wheedling tone ‚ÄúWell, obviously, I‚Äôm trying to build a narrative here, which is what all good marketing is about. Telling a story. Which is what we‚Äôre here to help you do.‚Äù‚ÄúYes, but how much of your story is real?‚Äù Alice asked, sternly. She was well versed in the Dragon‚Äôs shenanigans, and this had very much the same smell to it.Pinocchio muttered something.‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Alice.‚ÄúI do help people with marketing,‚Äù he said sullenly.‚ÄúHow many people?‚Äù asked Alice. ‚ÄúAnd can I talk to any of them?‚ÄùHe waved his hand vaguely and muttered about data protection.‚ÄúWell, can you show me the marketing campaigns you helped them with?‚ÄùPinocchio looked slightly shocked. Then, as something occurred to him, he smiled greasily and said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, I did them all under nondisclosure agreements.‚Äù‚ÄúSo,‚Äù said Alice, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell me who you‚Äôve worked with. You can‚Äôt tell me what you did for them. And from the photographs that you‚Äôre showing me, it would appear that you have a talent for photoshop and green screens, and little else.‚ÄùPinocchio opened his mouth to protest. Then shut it again. Then opened it. He was starting to do an excellent impression of a guppy.‚ÄúI won‚Äôt stand here and have my integrity questioned!‚Äù he squeaked.‚ÄúPerhaps you could show me a campaign you‚Äôve completed for your own business?‚Äù asked Alice, as sweetly as she could.Pinocchio looked her directly in the eye. Then he took out his wallet and handed back the money that she‚Äôd paid him for his consultation today.With as much dignity as he could muster, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre a good match. So in good faith, I shall refund my fee, on the condition that you do not break the confidentiality of our discussions here today.‚ÄùAlice opened the door of the Castle once again and watched him as he stalked through it.She had been just a little girl when her parents had left her in charge of a crumbling castle ‚Äî with only a cast of reprobate fairytale characters to help her. Her best friend was a fire-breathing Dragon and her mentor was a 300-year-old Witch. She had nothing to fear from a real boy. He wasn‚Äôt even wearing armour.‚ÄúNot a chance,‚Äù she smiled, as she closed the door behind him.",30/05/2019,1,0,0,0,810,450,1,0,0,0,161
I Bought a Lap Desk and I Feel Guilty About It,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/i-bought-a-lap-desk-and-i-feel-guilty-about-it-9ccebe4389c1,Zulie Rane,66000,5,855,"I felt oddly apprehensive as I pressed the ‚ÄúBuy now‚Äù button on Amazon. I‚Äôd just spent ¬£23.89 (about thirty bucks) on a lap desk. I nearly looked over my shoulder, sure that someone was about to scold me for making a frivolous purchase, spending my hard-won cash on something I didn‚Äôt really need.It‚Äôs true, I don‚Äôt need the lap desk. I can write OK as I sit on the couch. I can also do it in bed, or at the kitchen table. None of these places are impossible to write in. I‚Äôve done it for eight months, after all.But it‚Äôs hard. I get finger cramps, and I‚Äôve caught myself longing for a comfier, easier way to write. I‚Äôve crushed these feelings because silly as it may sound, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm worth it.Up until now, I‚Äôve postponed the purchase. After all, I‚Äôm not a real writer, just a hobby blogger. I don‚Äôt really need or deserve this small luxury. When I‚Äôm established, I tell myself, when I‚Äôm wealthy and famous and own several houses all paid from my first advance on a book ‚Äî then I can consider my little writing hobby serious enough to get a lap desk to write from.This month, I made $1300 writing on Medium. That‚Äôs nearly as much as my actual waged day job, and it‚Äôs a lot more fun and rewarding for me. It‚Äôs enough to buy not one, but 43 lap desks if I chose, and I‚Äôd still have money left over from the previous seven months. From a numeric perspective, it‚Äôs not a luxury or even a reward. It‚Äôs just a small investment to make my writing easier.And yet I catch myself doubting. To me, the word investment means there has to be a return on it. I catch myself wildly thinking that for every dollar I spend on lap desks, I want to earn an additional two dollars. To buy the lap desk, the lap desk needs to actively contribute to my earnings. In order to justify the purchase, my gut tells me, the lap desk must be guaranteed to make me earn more.Fortunately or unfortunately, I can earn just as much without the lap desk. The small comfort won‚Äôt make my stories automatically worth more. There‚Äôs no financial return on this investment. All it will do is make it a bit easier, a bit nicer, maybe a bit faster to write. And for some reason, that isn‚Äôt enough to make my purchase guilt-free.When I told my partner how much I was paying for ConvertKit, my email list, he audibly gasped.‚ÄúAren‚Äôt there free mailing list services out there?‚Äù he asked. He‚Äôs right ‚Äî my modest mailing list can be handled for free by a number of other providers. And he‚Äôs only voicing the same thoughts I had myself when I debated about whether or not to make the purchase. Is it worth it? Will I see a return on my investment? How can I justify this?The truth is, I haven‚Äôt earned any money from my mailing list yet. And I probably won‚Äôt, not for a long time. Certainly not enough to justify the cost. And yet, to me, it‚Äôs worth it. I love staying in touch with the people who read my stories and choose to follow me. I love communicating with them on email, which to me is much more conversational than via comments.Even though my mailing list doesn‚Äôt actively earn me money, it is worth it to me to have a recurring monthly expenditure on an easy-to-use, fun way to stay in contact with my readers. Other, free providers were clunkier, harder to use, less fun and simple.And yet I still have to repeat to myself: my time is worth it. My readers are worth it. It doesn‚Äôt need to earn me money to be a worthwhile investment.I wish I‚Äôd started sooner. Maybe I‚Äôll feel like that writing from my new lap desk, too.On the one hand, it‚Äôs just a piece of furniture that makes writing a bit more comfortable for me.On the other, it‚Äôs also a sign that I‚Äôm taking myself seriously as a writer, worthwhile of investments not just into my money-making, but rather my comfort, my enjoyment, my love of writing.For so long, I‚Äôve felt like only money validates my passion. Only the fact that I earn a lot means that I can take my writing seriously. And for so long, I‚Äôve felt that any investments can only be for financial gain. I didn‚Äôt hesitate before buying an iPad case with a keyboard, because I needed to be able to write on vacation. I didn‚Äôt think twice before buying a membership to this site, because it helps me earn more money.But it‚Äôs my eighth month writing for money. It‚Äôs my eighth month of earning a serious amount by sharing my stories. It‚Äôs my eighth month of writing without a lap desk.Next month, I‚Äôll be ¬£23.89 poorer, but a good deal more comfortable. And even if I never see a return from that money, it‚Äôs still worthwhile to me, because it helps me write. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. That‚Äôs what I love.",30/05/2019,8,0,0,0,1050,816,3,0,0,6,1200
How We Used a Bad Glassdoor Review to Improve Our Company Culture,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-virtue-of-a-blisteringly-bad-glassdoor-review-781240552a00,Leigh Fatzinger,1200,5,1170,"I was traveling on an East Coast, West Coast business trip last week and arrived home late Thursday. I was eager for a quiet, pre-Memorial Day Friday in the office. My first meeting was a one-on-one with a colleague to review a couple of items and riff on a few ideas.During the meeting, my colleague paused, and then asked: ‚ÄúDid you happen to see the latest review we received on Glassdoor?‚ÄùI hadn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúYou should take a look,‚Äù they said.I pulled up Glassdoor on my phone and quickly scanned the review. As I consumed it, the words made me pause, slow down, and read it again. And then again.The language took me back in time ‚Äî to six years ago, when Turbine Labs had no employees. It was a simpler, more straightforward time. ‚ÄúSolopreneur‚Äù companies are pure ideas and execution. The culture is a culture of one. If a solopreneur can‚Äôt live with the culture they‚Äôve created for themselves‚Ä¶then it‚Äôs clearly time to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job.Solopreneur companies with ideas and customer demands that require more expertise and resources often decide to hire their first employee. Going from zero to one is the most difficult. Going from one to two, four to eight, eight to sixteen, and so on, is somewhat more straightforward. At some point, as employees join, culture forms. Experiences form. Ideas form. Relationships form. Memories form.So when a former employee writes a scathing review of their experience, their relationship, our culture, our ideas ‚Äî the immediate reaction is visceral. What did we do wrong? Where did I go wrong?The easy way out would have been to think something like, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need them anyway‚Äù, ‚ÄúI knew the day they started they weren‚Äôt the right fit‚Äù, or ‚Äúeverything in that review is a lie.‚Äù But at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt help but think: who else here feels that way? Do they all feel that way?We‚Äôd put so much work and investment into building our culture (we‚Äôd doubled the size of our business in the last year). We wondered, were those investments delivering returns? Where were we falling short?It occurred to me that our employees and our customers expect the exact same thing when it comes to information: the truth. Delivered right between the eyes, without bias. Good or bad. Right now. So in the afternoon, I asked the entire team to pause their work and assemble in the conference room for an impromptu meeting.I started by telling the team I was going to read, from top to bottom, a review posted on Glassdoor a day or so before, written by a former employee. I read the text verbatim:The reactions varied greatly, but from the looks on the faces around the room, the most predominant seemed to be, ‚Äúwhy in the world is our CEO reading this terrible Glassdoor review out loud to the entire team?‚ÄùAfter reading the review out loud, I paused, took a breath, and said a few words about starting Turbine Labs. I told them that our people and our culture were more important to me than the technology we were developing. Because no great technology and no great customer relationships can be built without great people.At the same time, I questioned if I had completely detached from that aspiration into a state of, quoting myself, ‚Äúbecoming completely full of shit.‚Äù And if I was, in fact, completely full of shit, the only way I stood any chance of getting out of that state was to have people I trust come clean and tell me face-to-face.My next request ‚Äî which no one in the room was exempt from ‚Äî was having each person point out one or more aspect of their job, our culture, their experience, our software, their relationships with their team, manager, or me‚Äî anywhere we fell short of what they expected or what they were promised.The first person I turned to speak to was‚Ä¶uncomfortable. I reassured her that being bold, candid, and honest was essential to the exercise working. I didn‚Äôt want compliments or accolades. No sugar coating. Her response had to be something that frustrated/angered/annoyed her about her job, the software, our company, or me. Even better if it mapped to the negative Glassdoor review.So she did.I went on to the next person, and the next, and the next, listening to each of them describe their challenges working at a startup, their challenges working in a fast-paced digital newsroom environment, even their challenges working for a founder like me. After each person stated their concerns, they insisted on stating how things had improved from any given low point. Or, as the business grew, how they felt empowered to resolve or improve the issue themselves.It‚Äôs easy to write a scathing review of a job you once had. It‚Äôs harder to face your peers ‚Äî and the founder ‚Äî to describe real challenges, or what you‚Äôre downright fed up with, and then come to work the next day committed to being a part of the solution.That scathing Glassdoor review gave us the opportunity to check in with each other, to make sure each of us was being candid, open, and honest. It gave us the opportunity to ask each other who we are as a culture and come out the other side knowing we are much more than any single review. And at the same time, we were able to confirm with each other the importance of communication.‚ÄùCulture is not an immediate byproduct of the people working at a company but rather the product of conscious work and effort.‚Äù‚Äî Tony Hsieh, Delivering HappinessShowing up to Turbine Labs every day, with the ambition and mission of ensuring senior executives of large organizations have access to the most accurate, unbiased intelligence is really, really hard. We‚Äôre trying to change behaviors that have been ingrained in organizational cultures for a very long time.Have we been successful yet? No. Have we made a foothold? Yes. Are we proud of our progress so far? Absolutely. Could we yet fail? Sure. Are we perfect? Absolutely not.Some do not have the mindset ‚Äî or are not interested in the challenge ‚Äî to work towards something as bold as what Turbine Labs has set out to do. That‚Äôs fine. Some will go through their careers rarely facing a challenge head-on. Instead, they‚Äôll keep their heads down or hide behind anonymity. That‚Äôs fine, too.On the other hand, some are going to speak their minds ‚Äî whether prompted to or not. Some are going to take ownership of their work and their actions. Some are going to take bold chances.In order for anything to change, teams have to believe they can express themselves and have the fortitude and grit to improve the place they call work. Those that do are the ones who will change their trajectory, their careers, and the world.There‚Äôs virtue in the blisteringly bad Glassdoor review. I saw it first hand on a Friday afternoon before Memorial Day. And I left for the long weekend thankful for the opportunity it gave us.",30/05/2019,2,0,0,9,1050,756,2,0,0,2,172
6 Free Marketing Certifications That Will Boost Your Credibility,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/6-free-marketing-certificates-that-will-boost-your-resume-a2d0009cc599,Trevor D.,32,4,666,"The closer you get to graduation, the more stressful thoughts of the future become, especially if you are planning a career in digital marketing. New talent graduates regularly, and the industry is only growing so fast. So how do you stand out in a crowded room of recent grads?Easy: Certifications. Certs show your potential employers that you are self-motivated and hungry to learn industry-leading tools. Whether or not you are looking to end up on a creative team or media-buying team, the certs below will help you get ahead of your peers.When you use Google to look for a barber or restaurant, chances are you see an AdWords ad at the top of the search results. Google Ads teaches you the fundamentals of how you should organize, scale, and measure the success of digital advertising campaigns.It‚Äôs an amazing education, and everyone in digital marketing should have this certification. Best of all, Google Ads is a free certification. It takes two tests to complete: Adwords Fundamentals and a test in one of five ad subcategories (do the Search Advertising exam first, but do them all over time).Get started at Google‚Äôs Academy for Ads. It‚Äôs easy and completing the course sets you up for success on the exams.Doubleclick is currently the most popular ad serving tool. There are others, but none are used as common across the industry as Doubleclick. If your firm runs banner ads (they do) then knowing about how Doubleclick works is a must. The certification track can be found through Google‚Äôs Academy for Ads.In the marketing world, firms will live and die by ROI. Google Analytics is the best way to measure ad campaign and ad results. Put simply: Google Analytics uses code placed in the header of the website to determine where web traffic is coming from, and what actions are completed on your web page. Learning Analytics is easy with Google Academy for Ads. Google analytics code lives in the header of almost every B2C website and a lot of B2B websites too. After passing the exam, make sure to get comfortable with Google Data Studio. Your future clients will thank you.Twitter is one of the most prominent ad and customer service new media platforms. Almost everyone with a smartphone has the Twitter app installed. Twitter‚Äôs courses will teach you how to write the best copy you can in less than 280 characters. It will also show you how and where to use hashtags, and the best ways to use Twitter in advertising campaigns. The case studies covered in Flight School are fascinating and full of good and easily consumable lessons. Make sure to check out the ‚ÄúExtra Curricular‚Äù classes offered after finishing Flight School to learn more about media buys on Twitter.Bing isn‚Äôt the most popular search engine, but with its acquisition of Yahoo, it is the second most popular search engine. Its ads populate the same way as Adwords, but they remain in Microsoft‚Äôs digital properties. It‚Äôs an especially powerful advertising tool if your target audiences are baby boomers or older Gen Xers who still use Yahoo mail, and who use MSN as their homepage. The certification is free, and it does have some cool features. Lastly, Bing ads are cheap, so if your brand is looking to target an older audience with a small budget, your certification will come in handy.This certification is the culmination of all the certifications above. However, it is not as detailed. After passing the certs above, dive into this course and learn about how to tie landing pages to Google Analytics to Facebook, Google, and Twitter advertisements and measure their results. Think of Hubspot‚Äôs Inbound Marketing Certification as the most valuable capstone class you have ever taken.That‚Äôs it! Add the badges to your Linkedin account, and mention them in your cover letter and resume. Remember, nothing impresses employers like the motivation to continue learning. Certifications are a surefire way to show them that you will always look ahead and strive to find out more.",30/05/2019,3,0,0,0,863,502,7,0,0,17,498
How To Build a Pipeline of Freelance Leads,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-build-a-pipeline-of-freelance-leads-91ab7b98efd4,Ryan Waggoner,520,19,3734,"In order to have confidence when raising rates, picking your niche, and setting boundaries as a freelancer, you need a margin. That margin comes from having an avalanche of incoming leads.This guide will show you where those leads come from and how to keep your pipeline steadily filled with more incoming customers than you can handle.To get started, let‚Äôs look at the four components of business development as a freelancer.When I was looking at an empty pipeline and trying to figure out how I could get as many quality leads as possible, I broke down my ‚Äúbusiness development‚Äù into four buckets:These roughly go in ascending order of easiest to hardest, fastest to slowest, and least-lucrative to most-lucrative. You can think of it as a pyramid, with prospecting at the bottom and thought leadership at the top.For example, prospecting is relatively easy work (mainly just sending emails) and it can result in getting clients really quickly, but it‚Äôs usually not the most lucrative work. You‚Äôre competing to be heard among a lot of other providers and positioning yourself as a commodity.With ‚Äúthought leadership‚Äù at the top of the pyramid, it takes a while to get ramped up, even longer to pay off, and there‚Äôs no easy charted course for you. You probably can‚Äôt start speaking and writing for large audiences tomorrow, and it‚Äôs difficult work compared with sending responses to emails. But once you build a reputation and brand as a thought leader in your space, that‚Äôs when you get the best gigs.I want to break all these down further and give you practical advice on what to do for each of them.I call responding to freelance ads or RFPs ‚Äúprospecting‚Äù. These are people who are out looking for someone of your talent, and you‚Äôre going to respond. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not difficult or complicated.The best thing about prospecting is that these people are already actively looking for you, and you essentially are just raising your hand and saying ‚ÄúHi, I can do that for you.‚ÄùOf course, the flip side is that a lot of other people out there are raising their hands too!Going over the ins and outs of how to get responses to the emails you send responding to freelance job posts is outside of the scope of this guide, but here are some essential tips:Notes:Let me reiterate that last point again: don‚Äôt get discouraged. This is a numbers game ‚Äî you have to put in the time to send out the emails. I think that probably only 1‚Äì2% of the emails I‚Äôve sent out over the years while prospecting have turned into gigs. Your numbers might be better or worse, but don‚Äôt be surprised or discouraged if you have to send out a couple hundred emails before you land work from this.Here‚Äôs an email that I actually sent out:The next level up the pyramid after prospecting is promoting. For me, this falls into two primary buckets:Let‚Äôs talk about each of these.There are various places around the web where you have the opportunity to post that you‚Äôre a freelancer looking for work. I‚Äôll give you four right now that I have personally gotten quality leads from.I‚Äôve gotten five-figure engagements from all but Reddit. I only recently started posting at Reddit but I have several quality leads from there already.This is a tiny fraction of the potential places around the web where you‚Äôre invited to post about yourself and the services you offer. Here‚Äôs why you should take advantage of this:That last point is worth reiterating. I posted to TheyMakeApps probably five years ago, when I first started doing iOS development, and then completely forgot about it. Last year, I got a $20k project from someone who found me there.Some of these places you post once and that‚Äôs it, some are recurring weekly or monthly. If recurring, just set up a repeating item on your calendar and repost when appropriate ‚Äî it literally takes two mins.Your goal here is to show up everywhere that someone looking for someone like you might think to search. I constantly have people email me randomly saying they ‚Äústumbled across‚Äù my work. I literally sent an email to one of those leads five minutes ago, and I have no idea where it came from (of course I asked). It‚Äôs a nice feeling!This is a huge topic, and we‚Äôre not going to do it justice here ‚Äî I‚Äôll probably write a full guide to cover it later but here is the basic idea.Run paid ads on Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, as well as any niche advertising channels that make sense for your market. This will drive traffic to your site, which you then develop into leads.Now, this is not easy and it‚Äôs not free. It takes a while to setup, get dialed in, and pay off. You might need to dedicate at least a few hundred dollars a month before you start seeing results. If you do it wrong, you probably won‚Äôt get any return on your investment.For these reasons, this might not be the best fit for you if you‚Äôre in an emergency situation. I‚Äôm including it here for completeness, because it can be an important part of an overall promotion strategy.If you want to experiment with this, the main takeaway is that you should not just drive ad traffic to your homepage, hoping they look around and use your contact form to ask you to work in their project. That is a recipe for wasted ad dollars.Instead, you need to run targeted ads with a highly specific message and value proposition, give away something of value (lead magnet) in order to get them on a mailing list, and then continue to provide value (lead nurturing) until they they trust you enough to reach out.For example, I‚Äôm a mobile developer and product consultant, and my target clients are funded, mobile-focused startups who are building out their MVP and iterating on it while they gain traction and raise their next round.For example, I might have an ad strategy that runs ads on places where founders of mobile-focused startups congregate, like particular blogs, or maybe Facebook and Twitter (if I can get the targeting right). I send them to a landing page promoting a downloadable guide on planning the right MVP for getting traction fast, or maybe a 7-day email course on building a mobile MVP for $50k in 10 weeks, etc.Then, over the next few months, I send additional emails that provide valuable information about various topics related to mobile MVP design and development, with the occasional email (no more than 20%) promoting my services.If someone on that list reaches out to me, they already have a good idea of what I do, how I work, how much it will cost, etc. They‚Äôre pre-qualified and highly likely to convert.That takes a long time and it‚Äôs not something you can easily setup unless you already have all that content. It can work well, but it‚Äôs not for the faint of heart so I usually recommend waiting to tackle it.However, it fits with the thought leadership stuff that we‚Äôll cover later, since writing the content and then using it as lead magnets and lead nurturing material works well.These two methods make it easy to get leads flowing. However, they are likely to be of lower quality than the leads you can get from the next two categories: networking and thought leadership.If you‚Äôre in a crunch or just got started, focus on the above two methods for the next few weeks. If you‚Äôre in a settled rhythm, it‚Äôs time to start pushing up the pyramid.The best freelance jobs come from networking and thought leadership, but those can take time. Let‚Äôs see how you can approach them.Networking is a dirty word in many circles. For me, it conjures up images of schmoozy people at events running around collecting business cards. That‚Äôs not what I mean by networking.When I say networking, I mean two different things:Think of networking as intentionally building and maintaining professional relationships for mutual benefit.The ‚Äúmaintaining‚Äù part is important, as is the ‚Äúmutual benefit‚Äù part.Also, #2 is really a mix of networking, promoting, and prospecting, but I put it here‚Ä¶While #1 is very valuable and can catapult you into a new level of freelance success, it‚Äôs also something that takes time, is uncertain, and is hard to quantify.#2 is much quicker and easier and something you should start doing today, if you‚Äôre not already. It‚Äôs probably the best, most reliable way for you to get good work quickly.The real value here isn‚Äôt in the contacts you make, it‚Äôs in the relationships you build over time.To build those relationships effectively, you need a follow-up system.If you‚Äôve been freelancing for a while, you‚Äôve probably swapped emails, phone calls, and in-person meetings with dozens of people in your industry. Whether it‚Äôs fellow freelancers, past clients, potential clients, or just general business contacts, these are the easiest places for you to get work fast.The hardest thing about landing a new client isn‚Äôt closing the deal, it‚Äôs getting any response at all. How many random emails from ‚Äúinternet strangers‚Äù do you reply to?But if you‚Äôve already talked to someone in the past, you‚Äôre not a random person.I used to think that there was no point in reaching out to past contacts to see if they needed my services.‚ÄúThey know I‚Äôm here; if they need me, they‚Äôll reach out.‚ÄùWRONG!Think of it like this: I have worked with dozens of other developers and designers over the years on various projects, but if you asked me to name three designers right now, I‚Äôd really struggle to think of three names without checking old emails. I just have too much going on to maintain detailed lists of all the different professionals I know and what their status is.But I need designers all the time! If any one of those designers I‚Äôve worked with emailed me every few months to just check in, share some value, see how things are going, do you think I‚Äôd remember their name next time I need a designer? Hell yes.Also, don‚Äôt restrict yourself to professional contacts. I‚Äôve had great referrals because friends and family who know what I do bumped into someone who had a friend with a cousin working on an app startup, and my name found its way to them. It‚Äôs ridiculously unpredictable how these kinds of introductions are made, so make sure your name is out there.This doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated, but it‚Äôs definitely valuable. Keep it simple, follow these tips:Here‚Äôs an example of the type of email I send out all the time. In fact, I sent one like this a week or two ago to a fellow freelance developer and we have a follow up call scheduled to talk more:Or let‚Äôs say that I put in a bid for a job, but they decided to go with someone else. I might say something like this:Most of these will go nowhere at first, but that‚Äôs OK. You just want to get on people‚Äôs radar and then stay there. Over time, when anyone thinks of [SERVICE YOU OFFER], your name will be the first that pops into their head.By the way, I use Contactually to keep track of all my contacts and when I should follow up with them. There are some people I try and touch base with every month, and others that are every 3 months or every 6 months ‚Äî it just depends on the relationship.Your follow up system is a key part of long-term success as a freelancer. Having relationships in business doesn‚Äôt just mean the people that you see for coffee every week. You can get tremendous value from the long-tail of a very broad and shallow network. Those ‚Äúweak ties‚Äù that you touch base with once or twice a year are still very valuable in aggregate.One more thing: don‚Äôt be a taker. Spend a lot of time thinking about who you know and how you can connect people in your network that might be helpful to each other. I frequently ask people that I meet with ‚Äúhow can I help you?‚Äù and then I really do try and listen to what they say. Frequently, what they need most is not something I can provide, but I know someone who can.As a freelancer, you‚Äôre part of a global pool of talent. There are a ton of advantages from this: you can work for clients anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world, and there are a huge number of interesting clients and projects available out there.But it also comes with a significant downside: you‚Äôre competing with the rest of that global pool of talent. That can be tricky to do well, without seeing your rates plummet.So don‚Äôt compete globally! The world is packed with people who only want to hire someone they can meet with face-to-face. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs usually justified, but whatever, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt take advantage of it.It can often be far easier to land good contracts by meeting the right people in your own backyard. But you can‚Äôt do this from behind your computer, you need to get out there and meet people. Go to local tech meetups, startup events and so on. Even trade shows and events put on by industry groups, your local Chamber of Commerce for example, can be a great way to meet potential clients. Yes, some of the local businesses will want to pay peanuts, but you might be surprised what some local businesses spend on freelance development, design, and writing these days.I would concentrate your networking efforts for the first week on the follow-up stuff I talked about above, but for the next few weeks after that, try and get out to a local event every week. Start with meetups of people like you if possible, because you‚Äôll feel more comfortable.The other two things I would mention for networking are social media and cold outreach. Both can be extremely effective for the right person, but if they‚Äôre not you, that‚Äôs fine.Personally, I‚Äôve had mixed results with both. I‚Äôve found a few things that work that I don‚Äôt hate doing, but I‚Äôm not going to detail them here, because this post is already long enough!As with all of the biz dev activities, you‚Äôre going to have to try some different things before you find the mix of strategies that work for your industry, your experience, and your personality.I want to spend a little extra time here on the concept of thought leadership, because this idea is a mindset that you need to start infusing your entire career with.Let‚Äôs back up a bit and think of the different kinds of freelancers out there.The lowest-value form of freelancing is where you‚Äôre just labor. Someone needs a task performed that they could do themselves or easily find someone to do, but instead they hire you. You can make a living this way, but it‚Äôs not easy, fun, or glamorous. Examples might be housecleaning or basic administrative work. Please note that I‚Äôm not denigrating these types of freelancers, just pointing out that it‚Äôs hard to make a lucrative career out of it.Moving up the ladder a bit, you have freelancing where you have a specialized skill (like web development) that your client lacks, and you perform that skill for them. Most of the people reading this are probably in this bucket. By and large, you‚Äôre doing things that your clients probably couldn‚Äôt do for themselves, unless they‚Äôre also specialists with similar knowledge and skills.Most of us spend a lot of time and energy trying to move up within this category of ‚Äúspecialist freelancer‚Äù, trying to pick a more narrow niche to specialize in to differentiate ourselves, developing deeper and deeper skillsets within that niche, building our network and brands around it. Ideally, this allows us to charge more as we add more value. This is objectively a good thing, and a major reason why I‚Äôve been able to grow my business to a sustained level of high success.However, thought leadership is a level above having an in-demand skill that you perform for clients. If you‚Äôre a thought leader, you have a brand and reputation around teaching and advising about that skill to others, as well as performing it.For example, I‚Äôm an iOS developer, and my clients are typically startups who hire me to help them build and launch their MVP. I‚Äôm a specialist within that niche, and I‚Äôve built up a lot of knowledge, experience, connections, and wisdom around how to do that best.Until recently, I‚Äôve done a poor job at teaching other people how to do those things and why they matter. This is terrible for me, because when I approach a new client, they think ‚Äúoh, here‚Äôs an experienced iOS developer‚Äù. That‚Äôs nice, but the ideal would be for them to approach me, because ‚Äúholy $&@%, it‚Äôs Ryan Waggoner, and he literally wrote the book on building mobile MVPs!‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a bit over the top, but you get my drift! If I was a thought leader in my current niche, I would own the space of ‚ÄúiOS developer for mobile-focused startups who need an MVP‚Äù. When people thought of that, they‚Äôd think of me, or they‚Äôd find me quickly if they were looking for that. And then they would approach me.By the way, there‚Äôs an aspect of this that seems unfair to me. I know people who are ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù within their particular niche or space who are definitely not the most skilled or experienced practitioners of their craft. Even they would agree. But they‚Äôre still far more in-demand than the best in their field, and they command ultra-premium rates as a result. I know good programmers who literally charge 10x more than great programmers far more skilled, primarily because they‚Äôve been good at building a reputation for themselves.That‚Äôs not fair. If you‚Äôre the best in the world at some task, you should get paid the most in the world.The problem is that there‚Äôs no directory where you can go look up who the best in the world is at any particular task. If you want to assess someone‚Äôs quality and you‚Äôre not a specialist of the same type, you often have to depend on unreliable signals.A huge signal for most people is how popular and successful and knowledgable someone seems. If you see someone on stage at a conference talking about mobile UX, and they‚Äôve had big name clients hire them, and they‚Äôre constantly being published and they‚Äôre sought after as a speaker on that topic, you are probably going to assume they‚Äôre at the top of their field. Unless you‚Äôre a specialist in the same field, it‚Äôs hard to evaluate their skill level directly.One way to look at this is that it‚Äôs not fair. But another way is to realize that these people are giving away a lot of value every day through the knowledge and experience that they‚Äôre sharing and teaching. That generosity comes back to them in the form of ever-more-lucrative engagements, which lets them learn more that they can share and teach to others. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle.Please don‚Äôt take any of this as advice to be poor at your craft! You should always be striving to do excellent work and be great at what you do. But if you‚Äôre like most freelancers I know, you‚Äôre already good enough to be making much more than you are. What‚Äôs holding you back is your lack of reputation, because you‚Äôre not sharing and teaching what you‚Äôve learned.By the way, you‚Äôre reading this right now because in the last year, I realized that I‚Äôve learned a tremendous amount about building a successful freelance business, but I‚Äôve done a poor job sharing that knowledge. I‚Äôm not the most successful freelancer in the world ‚Äî far from it. But I‚Äôve done pretty well, learned a lot of things along the way, and there‚Äôs a lot of value in me sharing that and building an audience around it.So that‚Äôs why you need to strive for thought leadership.But how do you do it?To teach well, you need to learn to communicate effectively. Writing and speaking are the two most important ways of doing that, and probably where you should focus your efforts.How to become a great writer and speaker are well beyond the scope of this guide, but I would urge you to try and get better at both.It doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge thing in the beginning, either. You could start just by teaching some people one-on-one what you‚Äôve learned. At first, you should just start teaching the things that you‚Äôve learned in your craft. Here are some ideas for easy ways to do that:Pick one or two and do them for a few weeks. See what kind of reaction you get. It might be harder than you expect ‚Äî I‚Äôve found that teaching concepts I know inside and out to a new audience can sometimes be difficult, but it forces me to better organize my thoughts.Beyond the direct ways that you can apply thought leadership, you should try and infuse all of your sales and marketing activities with the same principle of teaching your skills, adding value from the beginning, and demonstrating expertise.Even when you‚Äôre prospecting and replying to a freelance job post, you should be positioning yourself as a thought leader. Include a link to relevant blog posts or screencasts that you‚Äôve produced, or suggest tools or resources that the poster might find relevant to the project they‚Äôre hiring for.I‚Äôve really only scratched the surface here of the different activities that make up the biz dev pyramid, but I hope it‚Äôs given you some ideas to think about.How should you divide up your time between prospecting, promoting, networking, and thought leadership? That depends on your pipeline and your preferences.If you‚Äôre booked up and don‚Äôt anticipate having trouble getting work in the next six months, I‚Äôd focus most of my time on networking and thought leadership. They take longer to get right and see results from, but they‚Äôre key to catapulting you to the next level of freelance success.On the other hand, if you need more work, better paying work, or just better clients, I‚Äôd focus on prospecting and promoting to start, because they‚Äôre easier to get working and having a lot of leads gives you a better shot at finding some good ones in there.",30/05/2019,3,3,4,15,1037,727,2,9,0,3,1600
How a Medieval Tradition Can Transform Your Brand,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/a-medieval-idea-that-can-surprisingly-transform-your-brand-9427457bfed5,Dan Salva,168,3,425,"Whether we are developing a new brand or refreshing an existing one, capturing the meaning of the brand helps people understand why they should care. And we do want them to care. Because when they care, they become loyal customers and even advocates for our brand.Thoughtfully chosen symbols, colors, and words can capture the meaning and spell the difference between our brand being instantly adopted and years of time and money spent trying to explain what the brand is all about. This is why we need to be diligent in defining our brand. An excellent place to start is with an idea that began centuries ago.The concept of a coat of arms started somewhere in the Middle Ages. Some person of some stature decided he needed to let the world know who he was and what he was all about. So he painted some symbols on his shield that he felt represented him. Before long, it became a custom. And the use of the coat of arms spread, adorning vestments, castles, and more.Going through the process of creating a coat of arms can be an enlightening exercise for a brand. It demands that we simplify the expression of who we are. And that forces us to strip away the nonessential and find the most powerful representations. In fact, we‚Äôre going to limit our coat of arms to three symbols and a short motto.This exercise is best run with a small group ‚Äî five to seven people. Ask each person a question, and write the answer on a big sheet of easel paper. After you get to an answer, ask the respondent, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Then write down all the different rationales on that sheet of easel paper. Here are the questions:The exercise yields a set of symbols and a motto (just like what you would find with a coat of arms). Equally important is the explanation behind each symbol. Describing what each symbol means takes us outside of the usual language we use to discuss the organization and the brand. This results in insights that will help evolve our brand.These insights provide the inspiration that will help create the new brand identity ‚Äî from the logomark and type to the colors and the rallying cry.By using this exercise, we move from simply redecorating our brand to transforming it. To creating an evolved manifestation that captures the meaning and aspiration that will engage the minds and hearts of those we hope to serve.That‚Äôs an impressive bit of enlightenment from an idea that came out of the Dark Ages.",30/05/2019,1,0,4,0,1050,699,1,1,0,2,75
Predicting vs. Explaining,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-vs-explaining-69b516f90796,Phoebe Wong,920,13,2915,"I recently stumbled across this really juicy debate on natural language processing that took place a few years ago between the old guard of the field, Noam Chomsky, who‚Äôs considered as ‚Äúthe father of modern linguistics,‚Äù and the new guard, Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google. When commenting on where the field was heading, Chomsky said the following:‚ÄúSuppose that somebody says he wants to eliminate the physics department and do it the right way. The ‚Äúright‚Äù way is to take endless numbers of videotapes of what‚Äôs happening outside the video, and feed them into the biggest and fastest computer, gigabytes of data, and do complex statistical analysis ‚Äî you know, Bayesian this and that ‚Äî and you‚Äôll get some kind of prediction about what‚Äôs gonna happen outside the window next. In fact, you get a much better prediction than the physics department will ever give. Well, if success is defined as getting a fair approximation to a mass of chaotic unanalyzed data, then it‚Äôs way better to do it this way than to do it the way the physicists do, you know, no thought experiments about frictionless planes and so on and so forth. But you won‚Äôt get the kind of understanding that the sciences have always been aimed at ‚Äî what you‚Äôll get at is an approximation to what‚Äôs happening.‚ÄùChomsky reinforced that sentiment repeatedly elsewhere: that the current definition of success in natural language processing ‚Äî namely predictive accuracy ‚Äî is not science. Throwing ‚Äúsome immense corpus of text‚Äù into a ‚Äúcomplicated machine‚Äù is merely ‚Äúapproximating unanalyzed data,‚Äù or ‚Äúbutterfly collecting,‚Äù that would not lead to ‚Äúreal understanding‚Äù of the language. He argues that the main goal of science is to ‚Äúdiscover explanatory principles‚Äù of how a system actually works, and the ‚Äúright approach‚Äù to achieve that goal is to ‚Äúlet the theory guide the data‚Äù: study the system‚Äôs basic nature by abstracting away ‚Äúirrelevant intrusions‚Äù through carefully designed experiments ‚Äî the same way modern science has been conducted since Galileo. In his own succinct words: ‚ÄúJust trying to deal with the unanalyzed chaotic data is unlikely to get you anywhere, just like as it wouldn‚Äôt have gotten Galileo anywhere.‚ÄùNorvig then responded to Chomsky‚Äôs claims in a long essay that challenges Chomsky‚Äôs notion of scientific success and justifies the use of probabilistic models to represent human language processing. Norvig points out that virtually all major application areas in language processing ‚Äî search engines, speech recognition, machine translation, and question answering ‚Äî are dominated by trained probabilistic models because they preform way better than the theoretical/logical rule-based old tools. He argues that Chomsky‚Äôs measure of success in science ‚Äî the emphasis on providing insights by answering why while downplaying the importance of describing how ‚Äî is misguided by quoting Richard Feynman: ‚ÄúPhysics can progress without the proofs, but we can‚Äôt go on without the facts.‚Äù And, perhaps a bit of a low blow, Norvig likens Chomsky‚Äôs focus on the ‚Äúdeep whys‚Äù to Bill O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs religiosity, and mentions that probabilistic models ‚Äúcreate several trillion dollars of revenue each year, while the offspring of Chomsky‚Äôs theories generate well under a billion,‚Äù referencing Chomsky‚Äôs books sold on Amazon.Norvig speculates that Chomsky‚Äôs disdain for ‚ÄúBayesian this and that‚Äù really came from this schism between the two cultures in statistical modeling described by Leo Breiman: 1) the data modeling culture, which assumes that nature is a black box in which variables are associated stochastically, and the modelers‚Äô job is to identify the model that best fit these underlying associations; 2) the algorithmic modeling culture assumes that the associations in the black box are too complex to be described by a simple model, and the modelers‚Äô job is to use the algorithm that can best estimate output with input variables, without the expectation that the true underlying associations of the variables inside the black box can be understood. Norvig suspects Chomsky doesn‚Äôt have a beef with probabilistic models (the data modeling culture) per se, but rather algorithmic models with ‚Äúquadrillions of parameters‚Äù that are not easily interpretable, and therefore not useful for addressing the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions. Norvig and Breiman belong to camp #2, who believe that systems like languages are too complex, random, and contingent to be represented by a small set of parameters; to abstract away the complexity is akin to ‚Äúfabricating a mystical facility that is exactly tuned to the eternal realm‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist, and so ‚Äúmisses the point about what language is, and how it works.‚Äù Norvig doubled down on this point in another paper, in which he argues that ‚Äúwe should stop acting as if our goal is to author extremely elegant theories, and instead embrace complexity and make use of the best ally we have: the unreasonable effectiveness of data.‚Äù He points out that in speech recognition, machine translation, and virtually all applications of machine learning to Web data, simple models like ‚Äún-gram models or linear classifiers based on millions of specific features perform better than elaborate models that try to discover general rules.‚ÄùWhat fascinates me the most about this debate isn‚Äôt what Chomsky and Norvig disagree on, but rather what they agree on: they both agree that analyzing massive amounts of data with statistical learning methods without understanding the variables tend to yield better predictions than the theoretical approach that attempts to model how the variables relate to each other. And I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs stumped by this: many people with math and science background I‚Äôve talked to also find this to be rather counterintuitive: shouldn‚Äôt the approach that‚Äôs best at modeling the underlying structural relationships also have the most predictive power? Or how could we predict anything accurately without actually knowing how things work?Even in academic fields like economics and other social sciences, the concepts of predictive power and explanatory power are often conflated ‚Äî models showing high explanatory power are often assumed to be highly predictive. But the approach to building the best predictive model is totally different from the approach to building the best explanatory model, and modeling decisions often result in trade-offs between the two goals. To illustrate the methodological differences, here‚Äôs a short summary of prediction and inference modeling in ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Statistical Learning.‚Äù(ISL)The foundational principle of predictive models is relatively straightforward: to estimate Y using a set of readily available input X. If the error term of X averages to zero, Y can be predicted using:where ∆í is the systematic information on Y provided by X, which results in ≈∂ (prediction of Y) when given X. The exact functional form of ∆í is usually not relevant as long as it accurately predicts Y, and ∆í is treated as a ‚Äúblack box.‚ÄùThe accuracy of this type of model can be decomposed into two parts: reducible error and irreducible error:In order to improve the predictive accuracy of the model, the main objective is to minimize the reducible error by using the most appropriate statistical learning techniques to estimate ∆í.When our goal is to understand the relationship between X and Y, i.e. how Y changes as a function of X, ∆í cannot be treated as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù because we can‚Äôt identify the effect of X on Y without knowing the functional form of ∆í.Almost always the case, parametric methods are used to estimate ∆í when modeling inferences. Parametric refers to how this approach simplifies the estimation of ∆í by assuming a parametric form of ∆í and estimating ∆í via the assumed parameters. There are two general steps in this approach:1. Make an assumption about the functional form of ∆í. The most common assumption is that ∆í is linear in X:2. Use the data to fit the model, i.e. find values of parameters Œ≤‚ÇÄ, Œ≤‚ÇÅ,‚Ä¶,Œ≤p such that:The most common approach to fitting the model is ordinary least squares (OLS).You might already be wondering: how do we know if ∆í has a linear form? Because the true form of ∆í is unknown, we don‚Äôt actually know, and if the model we chose is too far from the true ∆í, our estimates will be biased. So then why would we want to make such a strong assumption in the first place? That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an inherent trade-off between a model‚Äôs flexibility and interpretability. Flexibility refers to the range of shapes that a model can produce to fit the many different possible functional forms of ∆í, and so the more flexible a model is, the better fit it can produce, which improves its predictive accuracy. But a more flexible model is generally more complex and requires more parameters for fitting, and the estimates of ∆í often become too complicated for the associations of any individual predictors to be interpretable. On the other hand, the parameters in a linear model are relatively simple and interpretable, even though it does not do a very good job in predicting accurately. Here‚Äôs a great chart in ISL that illustrates this trade-off in different statistical learning models:As you can see, the more flexible machine learning models with better predictive accuracy such as Support Vector Machine and Boosting methods are also very low on interpretability. And by making strong assumption on the functional form of ∆í to make the model more interpretable, inference modeling is also giving up predictive accuracy in the process.But wait! Even if you use a highly interpretable model with very good fit, you still can‚Äôt use those statistics as the stand-alone evidence of causality. That‚Äôs because of the old, tired cliche of ‚Äúcorrelation isn‚Äôt causation‚Äù and here‚Äôs a neat example: suppose you have data on the lengths of a hundred flag poles, the lengths of their shadows, and the sun‚Äôs position. You know that the length of the shadow is caused by the pole‚Äôs length and the sun‚Äôs position, but even if you set the pole‚Äôs length as dependent variable and the shadow length as independent variable, your model would still get a really good fit with statistically significant coefficients, etc. That‚Äôs why causal inferences cannot be made by statistical models alone and require background knowledge ‚Äî the inferred causality must be justified by some prior theoretical understanding of the relationship. Data analysis and statistical modeling for causal inferences are therefore often heavily guided by theoretical models.‚Ä¶AND even if you do have a solid theoretical justification for saying X causes Y, identifying the causal effect is still often super tricky. That‚Äôs because estimating the causal effect involves identifying what would have happened in a counterfactual world in which X didn‚Äôt take place, which is by definition unobservable. Here‚Äôs another neat example: suppose you want to identify the effect of vitamin C on health. You have data on whether someone takes vitamins (X=1 if they do; 0 otherwise), and some binary health outcomes (Y=1 if they‚Äôre healthy; 0 otherwise), that looks like this:Y‚ÇÅ represents the health outcomes of those who take vitamin C and Y‚ÇÄ is the outcome of those who don‚Äôt. To identify the effect of vitamin C on health, we‚Äôd estimate the mean treatment effect:ùõâ = E(Y‚ÇÅ)- E(Y‚ÇÄ)But in order to do that, we‚Äôd need to know what the health outcomes of those who are taking vitamin C would have been had they not taken any vitamin C, and vice versa (or E(Y‚ÇÄ|X = 1) and E(Y‚ÇÅ|X = 0)), which are indicated as the asterisks in the table and represent the unobservable counterfactual outcomes. The mean treatment effect (ùõâ) cannot be consistently estimated without these inputs.Worse yet, now imagine that people who are already healthy tend to take vitamin C, and already unhealthy people tend not to. In this scenario, the estimates would show a strong treatment effect, even if vitamin C actually has no effect on health at all. Here, prior health is called a confounding factor that affects both vitamin C intake and health (X and Y), which leads to biased estimates of ùõâ.The safest way to produce a consistent estimate of ùõâ is by randomizing treatment through an experiment, so that X is independent of Y. When treatment is randomly assigned, the untreated group‚Äôs outcome, on average, serves as an unbiased proxy to the counterfactual outcomes of the treatment group and ensures there is no confounding factor. A/B testing is guided by that insight. But randomized experiments are not always possible (or ethical, say if we want to study the health effects of smoking or eating too many chocolate chip cookies), and in those cases, causal effects would have to be estimated from observational data with often non-randomized treatments. There are many statistical techniques that identify causal effects in non-experimental settings by constructing the counterfactual outcomes or simulating random treatment assignments in the observational data, but as you can imagine, the results of these types of analyses are often not very robust or reproducible. And more importantly, these layers of methodological hurdles are not designed to improve the predictive accuracy of the model, but to present evidence of causality through the combination of logic and statistical inferences.It‚Äôs also much easier to measure the success of a predictive model than a causal model ‚Äî while there are standard performance metrics for predictive models, it‚Äôs much more challenging to assess relative success of causal models, which perhaps makes them a whole lot less emotionally gratifying to do. But even though causal inferences are tricky to make, it doesn‚Äôt mean we should stop trying. The main point here is that predictive and causal models serve very different purposes and require very different data and statistical modeling processes, and often we need to do both. This example on the movie industry illustrates the point: movie studios use predictive models to project box office revenues in order to anticipate the financial outcome of a theatrical release, assess the financial risks/return of their movie portfolio, etc., but predictive models are not very useful for understanding the structure and dynamics of the movie market and inform investment decisions; that‚Äôs because in the earlier stages of the movie production process (usually years before the release date) when investment decisions are made, the variance of possible outcomes is really high, and so the accuracy of predictive models based on inputs from the early stages is highly degraded. Predictive models are the most accurate near the theatrical release date when most production decisions have already been made, i.e. when the prediction is no longer particularly actionable. On the other hand, causal inference modeling allows studios to learn how different production characteristics could affect potential revenue during the early stages of the production process, and therefore are crucial for informing their production strategies.Judging from the current state of quantitative research literature, it‚Äôs not hard to see why Chomsky is upset ‚Äî predictive models are now dominating both academia and industry. This textual analysis of academic preprints finds that the fastest growing quantitative research fields are increasingly focusing on predictions in this decade. For example, in AI, papers mentioning terms related to ‚Äúprediction‚Äù have grown by >2x, while papers mentioning terms related to ‚Äúinference‚Äù have fallen by half since 2013. Data science curriculums today largely ignore causal inference methodologies, and the data science industry mostly expects practitioners to focus on predictive models. Even the high profile data science competitions like Kaggle and the Netflix prize are always based on improving predictive performance metrics.On the other hand, there are still many fields where not enough attention has been paid on empirical prediction and can benefit from the advances made in machine learning and predictive modeling. But to frame the current state of affairs as a cultural war between ‚ÄúTeam Chomsky‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeam Norvig‚Äù seems like a false choice ‚Äî there is no reason why we could only choose one and there are plenty of opportunities for cross-fertilization between the two cultures. There are lots of work being done to make machine learning models more interpretable, and I‚Äôm personally especially excited by the work done by Susan Athey at Stanford that applies machine learning techniques in causal inference methodology (I‚Äôll be writing about them in the next few weeks ‚Äî stay tuned!).I can‚Äôt think of a better way to end on a high note and bring this blog full circle than plugging Judea Pearl‚Äôs work. Pearl led the AI research work in the 1980s that allowed machines to reason probabilistically using Bayesian networks, but has since became the biggest critic on how AI‚Äôs sole focus on probabilistic associations is handicapping advances. Echoing Chomsky‚Äôs sentiment, Pearl argues that ‚Äúall the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just fitting a curve to data,‚Äù and AI today is stuck doing the exact same things (to predict and diagnose/classify) that machines already knew how to do 30 years ago ‚Äî only marginally better at them ‚Äî yet prediction and diagnosis are ‚Äúmerely the tip of human intelligence.‚Äù He believes that the key to making truly intelligent machines that think like humans is to teach machines to think about cause and effect, so that machines can ask counterfactual questions, plan experiments, and find new answers to scientific questions. His work in the past three decades focuses on building a formal language for machines in order to make causal reasoning possible, similar to his work on Bayesian networks that enabled machines to make probabilistic associations. In one of his papers, he claims that:‚Äúthe bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufficient for capturing those relationships‚Ä¶ It is for this reason that I consider myself only a half-Bayesian.‚ÄùSeems like data science would benefit from having more half-Bayesians.",25/07/2019,9,0,0,7,736,471,8,0,0,21,1500

Unlike the feed-forward neural networks, the recurrent neural networks use their internal state memory for processing sequences. This dynamic behavior of the Recurrent neural networks allows them to be very useful and applicable to audio analysis, handwritten recognition, and several such applications.Mathematically the simple RNN can be formulated as follows:Where x(t) and y(t) are the input and output vectors, W·µ¢‚Çï, W‚Çï‚Çï, and W‚Çï‚Çí are the weight matrices and f‚Çï and f‚Çí are the hidden and output unit activation functions.The implementation of RNN with 2 Simple RNN layers each with 32 RNN cells followed by time distribute dense layers for 10 class classification can be illustrated as follows:The parameters:The model summary is as follows:LSTM, also known as the Long Short Term Memory is an RNN architecture with feedback connections, which enables it to perform or compute anything that a Turing machine can.A single LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate, which facilitates the cell to remember values for an arbitrary amount of time.

Use Cython to get more than 30X speedup on your Python code,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/use-cython-to-get-more-than-30x-speedup-on-your-python-code-f6cb337919b6,George Seif,21000,4,695,"Want to be inspired? Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. üòéPython is a community favourite programming language! It‚Äôs by far one of the easiest to use as code is written in an intuitive, human-readable way.Yet you‚Äôll often hear the same complaint about Python over and over again, especially from the C code gurus out there: Python is slow.And they‚Äôre not wrong.Relative to many other programming languages, Python is slow. Benchmark game has some solid benchmarks for comparing the speed of various programming languages on different tasks.There‚Äôs a couple of different ways to speed things up that I‚Äôve written about before:(1) Use multi-processing libraries to use all the CPU cores(2) If you‚Äôre using Numpy, Pandas, or Scikit-Learn, use Rapids to accelerate the processing on GPU.Those are great if what you‚Äôre doing can, in fact, be parallelized, such as data pre-processing or matrix operations.But what if your code is pure Python? What if you have a big for-loop that you just have to use and can‚Äôt put into a matrix because the data has to be processed in sequence? Is there a way to speedup Python itself?That‚Äôs where Cython comes in to speed up our raw Python code.At its core, Cython is an intermediate step between Python and C/C++. It allows you to write pure Python code with some minor modifications, which is then translated directly into C code.The only adjustment you make to your Python code is adding type information to every variable. Normally, we might declare a variable in Python like this:With Cython, we‚Äôre going to add a type to that variable:This tells Cython that our variable is floating point, just like we would do in C. With pure Python, the variable‚Äôs type is determined on the fly. The explicit declaration of the type in Cython is what makes the conversion to C possible, since explicit type declarations are required+.Installing Cython requires just a single line of pip:When using Cython, there are two different sets of types, for variables and functions.For variables we have:Notice how all of these types come from C/C++! For the functions we have:With an understanding of Cython types in hand, we can go right ahead and implement our speedup!The first thing we‚Äôll do is set up a Python code benchmark: a for-loop used to compute the factorial of a number. The raw Python code is shown below:Our Cython equivalent of the same function looks very similar. First, we‚Äôll make sure that our Cython code file has a .pyx extension. The only change to the code itself is that we‚Äôve declared the type of each and every variable and function.Notice how the function has a cpdef to make sure we can call it from Python. Also see how even our looping variable i has a type. You‚Äôll need to set the type for all of the variables in the function, so that the C compiler knows what type to use!Next, create a setup.py file which will compile the Cython code into C code:And perform the compilation:Boom! Our C code has been compiled and is ready to use!You‚Äôll see that in the folder where your Cython code is, you have all the files needed to run C code, including the run_cython.c file. If you‚Äôre curious, take a look at it to see the C code that Cython generated!Now we‚Äôre ready to test out our new, super fast C code! Check out the code below, which implements a speed test to compare the raw Python code to the Cython one.The code is very straight forward. We‚Äôre importing our files in the same way as regular Python, and running the functions in the same way as regular Python!Cython will get you good speedups on almost any raw Python code, without too much extra effort at all. The key thing to note is that the more loops you‚Äôre going through, and the more data you‚Äôre crunching, the more Cython can help.Check out the table below which shows how much speed Cython gave us for different factorial values. We got over 36X speedup with Cython!Follow me on twitter where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!

Autoencoders vs PCA: when to use ?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/autoencoders-vs-pca-when-to-use-which-73de063f5d7,Urwa Muaz,415,5,804,"Need for dimensionality reductionIn machine learning projects we often run into curse of dimensionality problem where the number of records of data are not a substantial factor of the number of features. This often leads to a problems since it means training a lot of parameters using a scarce data set, which can easily lead to overfitting and poor generalization. High dimensionality also means very large training times. So, dimensionality reduction techniques are commonly used to address these issues. It is often true that despite residing in high dimensional space, feature space has a low dimensional structure.Two very common ways of reducing the dimensionality of the feature space are PCA and auto-encoders. I will only provide brief introduction to these, for a more theoretically oriented comparison read this post.PCAPCA essentially learns a linear transformation that projects the data into another space, where vectors of projections are defined by variance of the data. By restricting the dimensionality to a certain number of components that account for most of the variance of the data set, we can achieve dimensionality reduction.AutoencodersAutoencoders are neural networks that can be used to reduce the data into a low dimensional latent space by stacking multiple non-linear transformations(layers). They have a encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder maps the input to latent space and decoder reconstructs the input. They are trained using back propagation for accurate reconstruction of the input. In the latent space has lower dimensions than the input, autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction. By intuition, these low dimensional latent variables should encode most important features of the input since they are capable of reconstructing it.ComparisonWhen to use which?Apart from the consideration about computational resources, the choice of technique depends on the properties of feature space itself. If the features have non-linear relationship with each other than autoencoder will be able to compress the information better into low dimensional latent space leveraging its capability to model complex non-linear functions. What does it mean for the features to have non-linear relationships? Let us do a couple of simple experiments to answer these questions and shed some light on comparative usefulness of both techniques.Experiments 2DHere we construct two dimensional feature spaces (x and y being two features) with linear and non-linear relationship between them (with some added noise). We will compare the capability of autoenocoders and PCA to accurately reconstruct the input after projecting it into latent space. PCA is a linear transformation with a well defined inverse transform and decoder output from autoencoder gives us the reconstructed input. We use 1 dimensional latent space for both PCA and autoencoders.It is evident if there is a non linear relationship (or curvature) in the feature space, autoencoded latent space can be used for more accurate reconstruction. Where as PCA only retains the projection onto the first principal component and any information perpendicular to it is lost. Let us look at the reconstruction cost as measured by mean squared error (MSE) in the table below.Experiments 3DConducting similar experiments in 3D. We create two three dimensional feature spaces. One is a 2D plane existing in 3D space and the other is a curved surface in 3D space.We can see that in case of a plane there is a clearly two dimensional structure to the data and PCA with two components can account for 100% of the variance of the data and can thus achieve perfect reconstruction. In case of a curved surface two dimensional PCA is not able to account for all the variance and thus loses information. The projection to the plain that covers the most of variance is retained and other information is lost, thus reconstruction is not that accurate. On the other hand autoencoder is able to reconstruct both plane and surface accurately using two dimensional latent space. So 2D latent space is able to encode more information in case of autoencoder because it is capable of non-linear modelling. Reconstruction cost is provided in the table below.Random Data ExperimentHere we create a random data without any collinearity. All features are independently sampled from a uniform distribution and have no relationship with each other. We use two dimensional latent space fro both PCA and Autoencoder.We see that PCA is able to retain the projection onto the plane with maximum variance, and loses a lot of information because the random data did not have a underlying 2 dimensional structure. Autoencoder also does poorly since there was no underlying relationship between features.ConclusionFor dimensionality reduction to be effective, there needs to be underlying low dimensional structure in the feature space. I.e the features should have some relationship with each other.If there is non-linearity or curvature in low dim structure than autoencoders can encode more information using less dimensions. So they are a better dimensionality reduction technique in these scenarios.All code for the experiments can be found here:github.com",25/07/2019,6,0,9,0,1011,389,6,1,0,3,571
"Learning SQL 201: Optimizing Queries, Regardless of Platform",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-sql-201-optimizing-queries-regardless-of-platform-918a3af9c8b1,Randy Au,1700,22,4923,"Caveat: As of this writing, I‚Äôve used the following database-like systems in a production environment: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hive, MapReduce on Hadoop, AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery, in various mixes of on-prem/hybrid/cloud setups. My optimization knowledge largely stems from those. I‚Äôll stick to strategies/thinking process here, but there are definitely features and quirks in other popular databases that I‚Äôm not familiar with, especially from SQL Server and Oracle.This article is about speed, common strategies for making things go FASTER while avoiding specific implementation details. I‚Äôm trying to express the thought process of optimization, not the specific mechanics. Before I knew it, it‚Äôs turned into a monster of an article. There‚Äôs a lot to cover!Optimizing queries is a hard topic to write about because it involves specifics. Specifics about database engines, software, and sometimes even hardware and network architecture. I‚Äôve been asked to write about this topic multiple times, and I‚Äôve always resisted because I couldn‚Äôt see a way to write a generally useful article for something that very quickly gets into the weeds.There are entire books written about how to optimize different database systems, which includes queries, but also details in the tuning of the systems themselves. They‚Äôre always written about a specific platform, not in general. It‚Äôs for good reason ‚Äî every platform is different and the tuning parameters you need depend on your workload and setup (write heavy vs read heavy, SSDs vs Spinning disk, etc).But on the way home during a nasty heatwave, I had an sudden flash of insight as to what threads tie optimization together. So I‚Äôm giving this crazy article a try. I‚Äôm going to avoid too many specifics and focus on the core thinking process that goes into identifying the things that will make your queries go faster. There will be forays into specifics only for illustrative purposes, and no real code examples. Also for brevity, I can‚Äôt be super thorough, but I‚Äôll link to examples and further reading as I go.Note: Throughout this article I will use the term ‚ÄúDatabase/DB‚Äù as shorthand to cover a huge variety of data stores with extremely different back-end architectures but present SQL-like interfaces. They could be your traditional SQL databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL, or a Hadoop based NoSQL store, or a NewSQL database like CockaroachDB.Making your queries fast boils down to making your queries do less work for the same results. There are many different strategies for achieving that goal, and it takes technical knowledge to know which strategy to employ.Doing less work means understanding 2 things:The route to getting there is extremely dependent on the specific technical circumstances you‚Äôre working under. Optimizing a Hive query is in some ways the polar opposite of optimizing a PostgreSQL query. In fact, some querying strategies that speed one up can actually slow down the other.What you‚Äôre actually doing when ‚Äúoptimizing a query‚Äù is finding ways to make your query workload play nicely with the hardware and algorithmic limitations of your system. It means the more familiar you are with hardware, software, and system peculiarities, the better you‚Äôll be at it.This is also why the topic is so difficult to teach, you can‚Äôt approach it as a kind of SQL style problem. The ‚Äúrules‚Äù are just guidelines and there are often counter-examples. You also can‚Äôt ignore the base implementation of the system ‚Äî while vendors will tell you you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about implementation, it matters.Here‚Äôs a list of the major points we‚Äôll be hitting today, it starts off in the database and just expands outward. It has link jumps for your convenience.I may have left out some cases (and you can always comment and tell me about things I‚Äôve missed) but these are the big ones can think of.Let‚Äôs get started.When it comes to blog posts on the internet about optimizing SQL queries, using EXPLAIN is usually the first (sometimes the only‚Ä¶) thing you hear about. EXPLAIN is the SQL way to summon a query execution plan from your database. It is the database giving you a report on how it plans on executing your query ‚Äî it will describe any indexes it‚Äôs using, the order of table joins, whether it will scan a whole table or not, sometimes even how many rows it expects to look at while doing the operation (cardinality).The idea is, if you have access to this plan, you should be able to figure out (somehow) how to make your query faster. What‚Äôs frustrating is that very often people don‚Äôt tell you how the heck you‚Äôre supposed to go about that.It takes practice and patience to learn how to read a query execution plan that at first blush looks like gibberish. It‚Äôs made worse that there is no standard for what an execution plan looks like. It is HUGELY different for every database.You seriously have to re-learn this skill for every database you use. You also have to learn where the quirks are (like sometimes MySQL EXPLAINs get the cardinality wrong and it gets misled because it makes weird assumptions about indexes).Regardless of what database you‚Äôre working with, you are looking for where the database is doing a lot of work and spending a lot of time. Then you see if you can find a way to reduce it. Consult your specific DB‚Äôs documentation to see exactly what each statement means.Hopefully you noticed the word ‚Äúdisk‚Äù popping up. Because in general, disk access is very slow and is something you want to minimize. Even with SSDs being faster than spinning disk HDDs, they‚Äôre still orders of magnitude slower than RAM. This is why the first part of optimization usually involves finding ways to avoid using disk where possible, and to use it efficiently where you have no choice.If you take a look at this comparison of CPU and RAM speeds vs SSD/HDD/Network ops, you‚Äôll see why. RAM access is 3 orders of magnitude slower than CPU/L1/L2. Persistent Memory modules, which is essentially SSDs that sit on the DRAM bus instead of the SATA or SAS bus are still about 3x slower than standard RAM.A more typical SSD, which we would consider a disk is 2‚Äì3 orders of magnitude slower then RAM, and spinning disk is in the milliseconds: 4 orders of magnitude slower than RAM. Networks are even worse at 5‚Äì6 orders of magnitude depending on conditions and the speed of light.[Return to topic list]Within this backdrop of ‚Äúreducing work‚Äù, hopefully you can see why indexes come up so often. An index is essentially a pre-calculated map of the data, and more importantly it tells the database where on a disk to find certain entries. This means you don‚Äôt have to scan through the whole table to search for everything.A full table scan can get ridiculously expensive because:Going deeper into indexing though, you still need to know how your specific database uses indexes. For example, PostgreSQL has had the ability to use multiple indexes at the same time via bitmap scans since version 8. Meanwhile, MySQL, even in their version 8, only really has HASH and B-tree indexes in the default InnoDB storage engine and can‚Äôt compose indexes together.Knowing such fiddly little details is actually important for optimization. In MySQL if you want to use 2 or more columns in an indexed query, you have to build a specific multi-column index using those columns, and the order matters. index(A,B) != index(B,A). If you had index(A,B), but need to access B quickly, you‚Äôd need at least a separate index(B).Meanwhile, in PostgreSQL, it is more common and preferred practice to just have separate indexes: index(A) and index(B), because it can automatically use AND/OR logic to combine A and B on the fly thanks to bitmap scans. You can build a multicolumn index(A,B) and it will be more efficient, but you get much of the gains already by having just 2 separate indexes. Moreover, it scales better if you later need index(C), and index(D) that you want to compose.Most database engines give you a variety of index algorithms to use when defining an index. The default is usually some variant of a B-Tree which works well for a large number of typical DB use cases. But you‚Äôll often find things like R/radix-trees for spatial databases, or hash and full-text indexes. Sometimes there‚Äôs even more esoteric stuff available for more specific use cases.Whatever it is, use the best one for your specific use case, using the wrong one is counter productive.Sometimes you have an index, but for some reason the query plan doesn‚Äôt use it. MySQL is often made fun of for its fairly dumb query optimizer, so many advanced users sprinkle a lot of index hints, notably force index (idx) and straight_join, to force the optimizer to do the correct thing. What often happens is the optimizer decided it would be more efficient ignore and index and scan a table because it had an incorrect estimation of the cardinality of one of the tables it‚Äôs operating on.Meanwhile, in PostgreSQL, index hinting is literally not a thing. Since an index hint is essentially a hack around the cardinality of certain tables, they‚Äôre liable to go stale as the database changes over time. Instead, the devs force you to rely on their query optimizer. Thankfully, the optimizer makes fewer mistakes than the MySQL one, so it‚Äôs not as crazy as it sounds, though you will occasionally hit edge cases that are hard to overcome.Not every database has indexes, many things that run off Hadoop, like Hive and Spark for example, doesn‚Äôt have this concept because the underlying HDFS system is merely a distributed storage system of large files and the tools are mere data processors. You can artificially create something like an index using the file structure (most common is to use years/months/dates) but you have to essentially maintain it yourself.Hopefully this above example can also illustrate for you how you being good at optimization means being very familiar with the particular tool you‚Äôre using.[Return to topic list]Indexes are largely about reading things off disk. You pay a pre-calculation cost to maintain the index when data goes in, but reading it becomes much faster. So what about managing writing to disk?‚Äî Hold up. Why are we even talking about writing to disk when we‚Äôre doing a SELECT operation you ask? Isn‚Äôt SELECTs mostly a reading operation?Sadly, SELECTs aren‚Äôt just purely reading data because sometimes you need to write to disk to finish an operation. The easiest example is with Hadoop, where every step in the MapReduce process involves writing the data out to disk so that it can be transmitted to the next step (see an execution overview here).Another fairly common scenario is when you are working with large data sets and the result sets don‚Äôt fit in the process‚Äôs main memory. The DB will then have to dump the contents to disk (whether it‚Äôs via OS swap or explicitly via to a file) to continue working. You‚Äôll often notice this when a query that took 5 seconds to run w/ a small data set somehow takes 5000 seconds on a slightly larger dataset.You‚Äôll need to refer to your specific database documentation to figure out how to tell if your database is writing to disk, but when you find that it is happening, it‚Äôs often a candidate for optimization.The only universal way to minimize disk writes in any system is to reduce the amount of data you‚Äôre handing at any given time. It will reduce the chances you‚Äôll be forced to leave fast memory and fall into disk. Even in situations where you have to drop to disk, you‚Äôll at least have less to write.You should also be wary of operations that increase the row count, namely making joins where a single row can be joined onto multiple rows of data. Your database might have optimizations to filter down a giant CROSS JOIN if you give it conditions to work with, but if you don‚Äôt give it conditions to start with, you can create some monstrous data sets.This also becomes even more important on a distributed data system such as Hadoop, individual worker nodes in the cluster will at some point need to transfer state and intermediate results to other worker nodes to continue working, and network traffic is even slower than spinning disk. You want to minimize this as much as you can, again by limiting how much data you are working with at any single point in time.[Return to topic list]A subquery effectively makes a temporary table of results within the database that lasts only for the query. A related feature that I‚Äôm lumping together here is the common table expression (CTE) is essentially a named subquery with nicer syntax that can be used multiple times within a query without repeating the execution.Subqueries are interesting creatures. They can potentially make things faster, or slower, and you have to think quite hard and experiment to see whether they are appropriate to use as an optimization or not.The thing to know about a subquery is that they are typically unindexed temporary table-like structures residing in memory. PostgreSQL won‚Äôt, but MySQL ‚Äúmay‚Äù try to materialize a subquery with a HASH index. Technically subqueries are unindexed in Hive and Spark too, but indexing isn‚Äôt really a thing in those systems so the point is a bit moot. It‚Äôs all just a heap of rows in memory or a table slowly spilled to disk. (It‚Äôs that word again, see where I‚Äôm going with this?)CTE/materialized views can also stop the optimizer from exploiting index relations between the logic of the subquery and main query, acting like an optimization fence that the DB won‚Äôt cross. This may or may not be desirable to you.The part that makes subqueries a potential optimization is when the cost to use them to filter down a data source is less than using the data source raw. A table scan of 1K rows can be cheaper than scanning a 1M row index. You especially see this in the Hadoop ecosystem because there‚Äôs no indexing and MapReduce spills to disk all the time anyways. A well written subquery can filter down a data set and reduce subsequent operations throughout the rest of a query. This is also why you prefer to use these operations early on in a MapReduce job where you pay a disk and network cost every step of the way.Meanwhile in a relational database, it is often much more efficient to use an existing index than to use an unindexed temporary structure. Doubly so if the subquery is so big that it has to go to disk. So you would use them more carefully, and try to keep their size small when you do.[Return to topic list]Continuing from the discussion about subqueries, what if the subquery was unavoidable but is impossibly slow? There are further things you can try to optimize ‚Äî use temporary tables with an index.Remember that the main flaw of a subquery was that they (largely) aren‚Äôt indexed. If only we could put an index on them, we‚Äôd be golden. The solution for this is to make a temporary table and put the index you need on it. Then we‚Äôll have a proper index (usually B-tree or similar) that supports many of the comparison operators we want.Another potential advantage of building a temporary table is that it is literally 1 keyword away from being a permanent table. CREATE TABLE vs CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE. If you‚Äôre going to reuse the structure multiple times across transactions, it could be worth it.But what‚Äôs the catch? What‚Äôs the cost of using a temp table?One is simply permissions, you need to be able to run the CREATE command and may not have that level of access. It can be a server security/reliability issue, especially in a production environment.Second drawback is that once you have this intermediate table in your system, you would have to maintain it so that it isn‚Äôt stale. As people start relying on the table, you might get additional demands to maintain it, or update it more often. That‚Äôs all overhead and dev time.Finally, because you‚Äôre making a table, you are explicitly writing to disk. I‚Äôve already hammered on how that‚Äôs a slow operation that you don‚Äôt want to do repeatedly. Your DB may have the option to create the temp table within memory instead of disk, but if it gets too big you‚Äôre back to disk. So you only want to use this option when you‚Äôre going to already write to disk anyway, so that the cost of writing to disk and making an index is largely negligible. You may also do this if you‚Äôre going to reuse the table a lot, making it cost less to do it once instead of repeatedly.[Return to topic list]If there‚Äôs one thing slower than spinning hard disks, it‚Äôs network connections. If you have a distributed system that needs to coordinate with a server on the other side of the continent or planet, you literally are bound by the speed of light as well as network congestion.On top of that, the bandwidth of a network link is usually smaller than the bandwidth of a hard drive to a CPU, which makes things run even slower. Also, network TCP overhead is a thing that surprisingly matters quite a bit.You might think that this is a problem for people with complicated distributed systems. It‚Äôs true that they factor more for a big Hadoop cluster than a single hosted server, but it does come up occasionally for even single server installations. As you scale out, your database is going to live separately from your application, or your analysis server.I once had a simple ad-hoc query turned regular dashboard, select a handful of fields from a large table, simple SELECT foo FROM TABLE. It was easy enough to pull the data to another server to run ingest into pandas and do the grouping/pivoting there for presentation. There were indexes and everything, but it was still relatively slow to respond.When I dug deeper, it became clear that a lot of the latency was in the part where the database was preparing and sending many megabytes of output over the wire to where the analysis was happening. The easiest way to speed things up was to shift some of the analysis logic into the SQL query itself so that less raw data had to be sent over the wire.[Return to topic list]For the vast majority of this article, I‚Äôve been talking about I/O, because I/O is typically where the biggest source of slowness is and where you can find the most low hanging fruit. But we‚Äôre not done! Computers have other things that can be slow, like the actual computing part itself!Databases are not magical systems of computation, they‚Äôre bound by the same algorithmic constraints as any program you write yourself. They can‚Äôt sort any faster than the best known sorting algorithms (and since they‚Äôre general purpose, they probably don‚Äôt use the ideal one for your specific situation either). That means that the specific operations and functions you call can have a significant effect on performance.Just remember, as with everything complicated and real-world, there are no panaceas. I can‚Äôt give you a hard and fast rule about what to do/not do. You‚Äôre going to have to think hard and actually test performance to find out what works for your specific setup.Handling text in any significant volume is always computationally intensive work. No matter what you do, if you have to scan through a whole string character by character, it‚Äôs an O(n) operation on the length of the string.So operators such as LIKE with % wildcards and case insensitivity are somewhat intensive operations. They also can have interesting interactions with indexes. The other string functions, split, substr, concat, etc. all use similar algorithms and so aren‚Äôt much better in many cases. Regexes are even more expensive to use because they‚Äôre much more complex. So the more you use these functions, the slower everything gets.On top of pure computational complexity, strings are probably the largest things you‚Äôll find actually stored within a database. This is assuming you use best practices and don‚Äôt store large BLOBs in your DB. If you‚Äôre using a unicode encoding, every single character could potentially be 1,2,3, or even 4 bytes of data depending on specifics. Text fields can hold potentially megabytes worth of text. All this means we‚Äôll be running out of RAM sooner.Window functions are awesome, coming out of a legacy MySQL 5.4 codebase way back in the day (which didn‚Äôt have window functions) and moving to Postgres 9.4 was an eye opener. Window functions can do things like calculate percentiles or lags which used to be extremely difficult and/or very join/subquery heavy to do without. In that aspect, window functions tend to be a massive performance boost over not having them.That said, they‚Äôre not magic. All the extra storing of array values and sorting is, again, computational work. They can be wasteful unless you‚Äôre careful about details like sorts and indexes and the size of the window. Optimizing them tends to involve experimentation and deep reading into query plans. But it‚Äôs doable, with examples like these.[Return to topic list]Overhead is rarely talked about to beginners, and even intermediate users of systems. For whatever reason, it‚Äôs considered deep nerdy voodoo because it‚Äôs bound up in the ‚Äúthe guts of the system‚Äù, in the meta layer of how the system works. But when you start looking for it, you start realizing that overhead is everywhere.Practically everything we do with computers involves a certain amount of overhead, essentially work that‚Äôs expended in preparation, and maintenance, of whatever it is we‚Äôre ‚Äúreally doing‚Äù. We‚Äôve covered a lot of things already that can be considered overhead depending on your perspective.As I previously mentioned, network overhead can be significant and we want to avoid it where we can by transferring less stuff over the network. It will eat into your maximum transfer bandwidth and isn‚Äôt a specific DB issue. It‚Äôs significant enough that Google had proposed and released a network protocol, QUIC that boosts network performance by avoiding some of the overhead associated with TCP (and nearby parts of the network stack) by using UDP.There‚Äôs also the ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù of spinning up a disk and seeking to the correct sector to read data out, which we see as the slow seek times of a HDD and why most systems are moving to SSDs. It‚Äôs also partly why we‚Äôre trying like hell to avoid disk operations in this whole article.Similarly, the database has lots of overhead to deal with itself. When it accepts a connection, opens up a transaction, commits a transaction, all that stuff takes time to do.How much could this overhead possibly be, you ask? Well, one extremely common optimization that comes up is uploading large amounts of data to a database. It is almost always the case that you want to avoid making multiple small INSERTs because the DB bogs down under the load. Even if you‚Äôre doing things all within a single transaction with many INSERTs, it still has to constantly spin up a query interpreter to handle each query call.Instead, it‚Äôs best practice to create one giant file (CSV or whatever) and batch load the data all at once, even if you send the file over the network via the query. This is multiple orders of magnitude faster. It‚Äôs utterly insane and mind blowing the first time you encounter it. But it makes total sense because for a small single-row insert, the connection/transaction handling time is more than it takes to process that insert.The same overhead issue also can apply to running a bunch of SELECT statements. There‚Äôs still overhead involved there too. If you keep hammering a database with lots of small requests, it will eventually bog down the whole sever. You‚Äôre going to want to either pull more data and process it locally, or consider using some kind of caching.One technique that applications actually use to increase app responsiveness and reduce DB load is to simply cache the results for queries for a period of time, so that repeated calls skip the DB entirely and just give the cached result. This is app-level stuff, and isn‚Äôt specifically an optimization for your SQL query, but it‚Äôs a common enough pattern for responsiveness that you might actually see it on some analytics tools you use.At the SQL query level however, caching is still a thing to be aware of. Multiple runs of the exact same query in quick succession can actually yield different run times even if the database is not caching the result. This is because the first query primes the disk cache and OS caches with data. It‚Äôs not likely to be your whole data set, but in narrow instances it‚Äôs a significant (and temporary) speed boost. This can affect any benchmarking you do if you‚Äôre new to the whole benchmarking thing.In fact, while you‚Äôre not usually aware of it, databases, and the OSes they run on, will use caching techniques to squeeze extra performance out. Here‚Äôs a post about Postgresql‚Äôs caching behavior, and broadly speaking other databases will do similar things to different degrees.[Return to topic list]As an end user just firing off queries, it‚Äôs very easy to forget that databases are multi-user systems. They generally handle things so quickly and transparently, you never really know that there are usually other people hitting the server at the same time. But as you push your server to its operational limits you can run into cases where queries from other users, or queries from your own parallel jobs, will start to have an effect on you.Machine usage follows human activity patterns, and so there are certain portions of the day that are busier than others. As reports and database queries start becoming automated, the timing of large batch requests becomes increasingly important. Overnight jobs are very commonly set to run at very similar times in the night (very often around midnight-ish), because everyone individually thinks the servers will be ‚Äúempty‚Äù then. Except they aren‚Äôt and now the system has to task switch between 10 batch queries all running at the same time.This is merely a resource scheduling issue, but I‚Äôve seen batch jobs that take only 5‚Äì10 minutes to run on a no-load server stretch to become 30min+ because they were competing for resources with a bunch of other jobs.General load is something of an annoyance because it makes things unnecessarily slow, but a more serious issue with contention can arise via locking. Databases want to stay consistent, and that sometimes means entire tables can be locked when certain operations are run, such as a big update/write. Whether it‚Äôs a row-level lock or a table-level lock depends on specific details, but in either case, if you have another query that needs to touch those the locked rows, they simply are not allowed to run until the lock is lifted.Locks can sometimes turn into pathological situations known as a deadlock, but that‚Äôs rare. More commonly it can make a traffic-jam of queries that seem to take forever simply because they‚Äôre waiting. Another less common effect is that locks can affect things like server replication, sometimes even taking data replication down, meaning no new data updates into/out of the server and causing all sorts of unintended side effects. (My deep apologies to the devops folk I‚Äôve broken replication for over the years with my ultra-long analytics queries).[Return to topic list]This whole article has been dedicated to making queries go fast. So it would be wrong to ignore the ultimate answer to speed ‚Äî more hardware and/or better software, aka, throwing money at the problem. It‚Äôs our last resort, not the first, but it can‚Äôt be ignored.Sometimes, despite all your best efforts at optimizing your queries to make things go faster, you smash into limitations in I/O and sometimes CPU that are insurmountable with the systems you have. In that case, there is only one thing left to do to make things to faster: throw money at it. Re-architect your systems, get more memory, bigger RAID arrays, faster disks, a faster CPU, faster NIC and interconnects, and when all that isn‚Äôt enough, scale it out via clustering. I‚Äôm not even joking, Facebook at one point had scaled their MySQL setup to an utterly insane level. If clustering is somehow not enough, redesign your entire app system architecture for the speed you need, not just the DB architecture.Our goal in optimizing our queries and databases is to squeeze as much performance out of our equipment as possible, to get the best performance for every precious dollar spent on a system. It‚Äôs very easy to lose sight of the big picture and laugh at the idea of ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt make it faster, buy more equipment‚Äù. But we need to admit that there is inevitably a hard limit to optimization, even when it‚Äôs a really high limit, but there does exist a point of diminishing returns. A perfectly tuned and modified Miata will never reach the same speeds as an F1 car.The final skill in query optimization is learning when you‚Äôve reached the point where all the viable optimizations have been done, when the trade-offs made for speed are more expensive than it costs to upgrade. It‚Äôs hard because it‚Äôs a process of elimination, the proving of a negative ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do more here‚Äù.But if you ever do find yourself in such a situation, then go out and upgrade the system so that you can get back to optimizing.In no particular order:",25/07/2019,3,0,10,10,859,327,4,5,0,53,936
Why Machine Learning Models Degrade In Production,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-models-degrade-in-production-d0f2108e9214,Alexandre Gonfalonieri,4400,7,1486,"After several failed ML projects due to unexpected ML degradation, I wanted to share my experience in ML models degradation. Indeed, there is a lot of hype around model creation and development phase, as opposed to model maintenance.Assuming that a Machine Learning solution will work perfectly without maintenance once in production is a faulty assumption and represents the most common mistake of companies taking their first artificial intelligence (AI) products to market.The moment you put a model in production, it starts degrading.As you may already know, data is the most crucial component of a successful ML system. Having a relevant data set that provides you with accurate predictions is a great start, but how long will that data continue to provide accurate predictions?In all ML projects, it is key to predict how your data is going to change over time. In some projects, we underestimated this step and it became hard to deliver high accuracy. In my opinion, as soon as you feel confident with your project after the PoC stage, a plan should be put in place for keeping your models updated.Indeed, your model‚Äôs accuracy will be at its best until you start using it. This phenomenon is called concept drift, and while it‚Äôs been heavily studied in academia for the past two decades, it‚Äôs still often ignored in industry best practices.Concept drift: means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as time passes.The key is that, in contrast to a calculator, your ML system does interact with the real world. If you‚Äôre using ML to predict demand and pricing for your store, you‚Äôd better consider this week‚Äôs weather, the calendar and what your competitors are doing.In the case of concept drift, our interpretation of the data changes with time even while the general distribution of the data does not. This causes the end-user to interpret the model predictions as having deteriorated over time for the same/similar data. Both data and concept can simultaneously drift as well, further vexing the matters‚Ä¶I noticed, that models which are dependent on human behavior may be particularly prone to degradation. Obviously, the risk can be anticipated based on the nature of your project. In most cases, a regular schedule of model review and retrain must be developed.Furthermore, most models are only able to capture patterns which reflect the training data they‚Äôve seen. A good model captures the essential pieces of this data and ignores the non-essential. This creates generalization performance, but there are limits to the degree any model can prepare for this.Generalization: refers to your model‚Äôs ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model. It is strongly related to the concept of overfitting. If your model is overfitted then it will not generalize well.The best test of generalization performance is to see how a model performs on real-world data over a long period of time. There are at least two major elements of this process.It might sound obvious but it is crucial to monitor your ML performance after deployment. If monitoring all features sounds like a time-consuming task, we can monitor a few critical features whose change in data distribution might skew the model results terribly. I strongly recommend you to create a strategy (by identifying the right elements) for this process before reaching production.Model monitoring is a continuous process.If you observe degraded model performance, then it‚Äôs time for restructuring the model design. The tricky part isn‚Äôt about refreshing the model and creating a retrained model but rather thinking of additional features that might improve the model‚Äôs performance and make it more solid and accurate.Once the above steps have been completed, it is time to recreate the model with the new or modified set of features and model parameters. At this point, the goal is to identify an optimal model that delivers the best accuracy, which generalizes well to some data drifts.I noticed that in some cases, a re-creation of models doesn‚Äôt improve model performance. In these situations, analyzing examples that the model got wrong and looking for trends that are outside your current feature set can help in identifying new features. Creation of new features based on this knowledge can give models new experiences to learn.One solution that we frequently use to maintain models with new data is to train and deploy our models using the same process we used to build our models in the first place. We call this Manual Learning. As you can imagine this process can be time-consuming. How often do we retrain our models? Weekly? Daily? The answer depends on your ML application.It can happen that, as we are manually retraining models we may discover a new algorithm or a different set of features that provide improved accuracy. Actually, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to review your process on a regular basis. As I mentioned earlier, you may find a different algorithm or a new set of features that improves your predictions, and this isn‚Äôt necessarily something a continuous learning system is good at.Perhaps you can update the model each month or each year with the data collected from the prior period.This may also involve back-testing the model in order to select a suitable amount of historical data to include when re-fitting the static model.Another solution could be to weight data. Indeed, some algorithms allow you to weigh the importance of input data.It could be interesting to use a weighting system that is inversely proportional to the age of the data such that more attention is paid to the most recent data (higher weight) and less attention is paid to the least recent data (smaller weight).My favorite approach is to have an automated system that can continuously evaluate and retrain models. The benefit of a continuous learning system is that it can be completely automated.In general, sensible model surveillance combined with a well thought out schedule of model checks is crucial to keeping a production model accurate. Prioritizing checks on the key variables and setting up warnings for when a change has taken place will ensure that you are never caught by a surprise by a change to the environment that robs your model of its efficacy.In the case of input variables where the data points have a high degree of independence, control charts, as used in Statistical Process Control, could be used to detect changes to the process.I insist on this point but your ML success also depends on the way you plan for the maintenance of your trained models. In several projects, I realized how business leaders inexperienced with the way models work may not anticipate this need.A productionized model includes monitoring and maintenance.Model performance on fresh data sets should be evaluated regularly. These performance traces should be visualized and compared regularly so that you can identify when it‚Äôs time to intervene. Several metrics for evaluating ML performance exist.The reasons for model degradation can be discovered and modeled explicitly. Recurrent temporal effects can be studied, understood, and exploited. This can be a project for the data science team to tackle once a model has gathered sufficient performance metrics. Well, assuming you‚Äôve been tracking them.A procedure for regularly considering performance metrics and triggering retraining or rebuilding of models is also necessary as without it you‚Äôll be able to see the loss in performance but have no system in place for resolving it.Beyond the tech aspect, I strongly recommend you to keep your best data scientists and engineers on the project after it‚Äôs in production. In contrast to classic software projects where, after deployment, your operations team handles it and engineers move on to build the next big thing, a lot of the technical challenge in ML and AI systems is keeping them accurate.You will need to invest in order to maintain the accuracy of the machine learning products and services that your customers use. This means that there‚Äôs a higher marginal cost to operating ML products compared to traditional software.To maintain high-quality models, algorithms should ideally be retrained with each data delivery. On the other hand, to optimize costs, it should be done as rarely as possible.Obviously, certain machine learning development practices incur more technical debt, hence entail more future maintenance than others. Machine-learning-specific development debt-risk factors are diverse. They include the myriad probabilistic variables, data dependencies, recursive feedback loops, pipeline processes, configuration settings, and other factors that exacerbate the unpredictability of machine learning algorithm performance.The more these complexities pile up, the more difficult it is to do the root-cause analyses necessary for effective maintenance.You won‚Äôt be able to fully automate your way out of that maintenance burden. Under any scenario, tending to machine learning models demands the close scrutiny, critical thinking, and manual effort that only a highly trained data scientist can provide.",25/07/2019,8,0,14,8,825,496,5,0,0,2,944
An Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks for Beginners,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks-for-beginners-664d717adbd,Victor Zhou,889,10,1385,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a kind of neural network that specialize in processing sequences. They‚Äôre often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks because of their effectiveness in handling text. In this post, we‚Äôll explore what RNNs are, understand how they work, and build a real one from scratch (using only numpy) in Python.This post assumes a basic knowledge of neural networks. My introduction to Neural Networks covers everything you‚Äôll need to know, so I‚Äôd recommend reading that first.Let‚Äôs get into it!One issue with vanilla neural nets (and also CNNs) is that they only work with pre-determined sizes: they take fixed-size inputs and produce fixed-size outputs. RNNs are useful because they let us have variable-length sequences as both inputs and outputs. Here are a few examples of what RNNs can look like:This ability to process sequences makes RNNs very useful. For example:Later in this post, we‚Äôll build a ‚Äúmany to one‚Äù RNN from scratch to perform basic Sentiment Analysis.Note: I recommend reading the rest of this post on victorzhou.com ‚Äî much of the math formatting looks better there.Let‚Äôs consider a ‚Äúmany to many‚Äù RNN with inputs x_0‚Äã, x_1‚Äã, ‚Ä¶ x_n‚Äã that wants to produce outputs y_0‚Äã, y_1‚Äã, ‚Ä¶ y_n‚Äã. These x_i‚Äã and y_i‚Äã are vectors and can have arbitrary dimensions.RNNs work by iteratively updating a hidden state h, which is a vector that can also have arbitrary dimension. At any given step t,Here‚Äôs what makes a RNN recurrent: it uses the same weights for each step. More specifically, a typical vanilla RNN uses only 3 sets of weights to perform its calculations:We‚Äôll also use two biases for our RNN:We‚Äôll represent the weights as matrices and the biases as vectors. These 3 weights and 2 biases make up the entire RNN!Here are the equations that put everything together:All the weights are applied using matrix multiplication, and the biases are added to the resulting products. We then use tanh as an activation function for the first equation (but other activations like sigmoid can also be used).No idea what an activation function is? Read my introduction to Neural Networks like I mentioned. Seriously.Let‚Äôs get our hands dirty! We‚Äôll implement an RNN from scratch to perform a simple Sentiment Analysis task: determining whether a given text string is positive or negative.Here are a few samples from the small dataset I put together for this post:Since this is a classification problem, we‚Äôll use a ‚Äúmany to one‚Äù RNN. This is similar to the ‚Äúmany to many‚Äù RNN we discussed earlier, but it only uses the final hidden state to produce the one output y:Each x_i‚Äã will be a vector representing a word from the text. The output y will be a vector containing two numbers, one representing positive and the other negative. We‚Äôll apply Softmax to turn those values into probabilities and ultimately decide between positive / negative.Let‚Äôs start building our RNN!The dataset I mentioned earlier consists of two Python dictionaries:We‚Äôll have to do some pre-processing to get the data into a usable format. To start, we‚Äôll construct a vocabulary of all words that exist in our data:vocab now holds a list of all words that appear in at least one training text. Next, we'll assign an integer index to represent each word in our vocab.We can now represent any given word with its corresponding integer index! This is necessary because RNNs can‚Äôt understand words ‚Äî we have to give them numbers.Finally, recall that each input x_i to our RNN is a vector. We‚Äôll use one-hot vectors, which contain all zeros except for a single one. The ‚Äúone‚Äù in each one-hot vector will be at the word‚Äôs corresponding integer index.Since we have 18 unique words in our vocabulary, each x_i will be a 18-dimensional one-hot vector.We‚Äôll use createInputs() later to create vector inputs to pass in to our RNN.It‚Äôs time to start implementing our RNN! We‚Äôll start by initializing the 3 weights and 2 biases our RNN needs:We use np.random.randn() to initialize our weights from the standard normal distribution.Next, let‚Äôs implement our RNN‚Äôs forward pass. Remember these two equations we saw earlier?Here are those same equations put into code:Pretty simple, right? Note that we initialized h to the zero vector for the first step, since there‚Äôs no previous h we can use at that point.Let‚Äôs try it out:Our RNN works, but it‚Äôs not very useful yet. Let‚Äôs change that‚Ä¶Liking this introduction so far? Subscribe to my newsletter to get notified about new Machine Learning posts like this one.In order to train our RNN, we first need a loss function. We‚Äôll use cross-entropy loss, which is often paired with Softmax. Here‚Äôs how we calculate it:where is our RNN‚Äôs predicted probability for the correct class (positive or negative). For example, if a positive text is predicted to be 90% positive by our RNN, the loss is:Want a longer explanation? Read the Cross-Entropy Loss section of my introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Now that we have a loss, we‚Äôll train our RNN using gradient descent to minimize loss. That means it‚Äôs time to derive some gradients!‚ö†Ô∏è The following section assumes a basic knowledge of multivariable calculus. You can skip it if you want, but I recommend giving it a skim even if you don‚Äôt understand much. We‚Äôll incrementally write code as we derive results, and even a surface-level understanding can be helpful.If you want some extra background for this section, I recommend first reading the Training a Neural Network section of my introduction to Neural Networks. Also, all of the code for this post is on Github, so you can follow along there if you‚Äôd like.Ready? Here we go.First, some definitions:Next, we need to edit our forward phase to cache some data for use in the backward phase. While we‚Äôre at it, we‚Äôll also setup the skeleton for our backwards phase. Here‚Äôs what that looks like:Curious about why we‚Äôre doing this caching? Read my explanation in the Training Overview of my introduction to CNNs, in which we do the same thing.It‚Äôs math time! We‚Äôll start by calculating ‚àÇL‚Äã/‚àÇy. We know:I‚Äôll leave the actual derivation of ‚àÇL‚Äã/‚àÇy using the Chain Rule as an exercise for you üòâ, but the result comes out really nice:For example, if we have p=[0.2,0.2,0.6] and the correct class is c=0, then we‚Äôd get ‚àÇL‚Äã/‚àÇy=[‚àí0.8,0.2,0.6]. This is also quite easy to turn into code:Nice. Next up, let‚Äôs take a crack at gradients for Why‚Äã and by‚Äã, which are only used to turn the final hidden state into the RNN‚Äôs output. We have:where h_n is the final hidden state. Thus,Similarly,We can now start implementing backprop()!Reminder: We created self.last_hs in forward() earlier.Finally, we need the gradients for Whh‚Äã, Wxh‚Äã, and b_h‚Äã, which are used every step during the RNN. We have:because changing Wxh affects every h_t, which all affect y and ultimately L. In order to fully calculate the gradient of Wxh, we‚Äôll need to backpropagate through all timesteps, which is known as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):Wxh‚Äã is used for all x_t‚Äã ‚Üí h_t‚Äã forward links, so we have to backpropagate back to each of those links.Once we arrive at a given step t, we need to calculate ‚àÇh_t/‚àÇWxh‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã:The derivative of tanh is well-known:We use Chain Rule like usual:Similarly,The last thing we need is ‚àÇy/‚àÇh_t‚Äã‚Äã. We can calculate this recursively:We‚Äôll implement BPTT starting from the last hidden state and working backwards, so we‚Äôll already have ‚Äã‚àÇy/‚àÇh_{t+1}‚Äã by the time we want to calculate ‚Äã‚àÇy/‚àÇh_t‚Äã! The exception is the last hidden state, h_n‚Äã:We now have everything we need to finally implement BPTT and finish backprop():A few things to note:We‚Äôve done it! Our RNN is complete.It‚Äôs finally the moment we been waiting for ‚Äî let‚Äôs test our RNN!First, we‚Äôll write a helper function to process data with our RNN:Now, we can write the training loop:Running main.py should output something like this:Not bad from a RNN we built ourselves. üíØWant to try or tinker with this code yourself?

Time Series Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-clustering-and-dimensionality-reduction-5b3b4e84f6a3,Marco Cerliani,5400,6,1024,"Time Series must be handled with care by data scientists. This kind of data contains intrinsic information about temporal dependency. it‚Äôs our work to extract these golden resources, where it is possible and useful, in order to help our model to perform the best.With Time Series I see confusion when we face a problem of dimensionality reduction or clustering. We are used to think about these tasks in more classical domains, while they remain a tab√π when we deal with Time Series.In this post, I try to clarify these topics developing an interesting solution where I work with multidimensional Series coming from different individuals. Our purpose is to cluster them in an unsupervised way making use of deep learning, being wary of correlations, and pointing a useful technique that every data scientist must know!I got the data from UCI Machine Learning repository; I selected the Public Dataset of Accelerometer Data for Human Motion Primitives Detection. These data are a public collection of labeled accelerometer data recordings to be used for the creation and validation of acceleration models of human motion primitives.Different types of activities are tracked, i.e. drinking, eating, climbing and so on. For a particular activity of a specific individual measured, we have 3 different sensor series at disposal: X-axis (pointing toward the hand), Y-axis (pointing toward the left), Z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the hand).I figure myself in this situation because it allows to carry out our initial problems of clustering (multiple individuals) and dimensionality reduction (multiple series for every individual) all in one single case.Below I plot 2 examples of data at our disposal coming from a male and female individuals. In total, we have 20 individuals with the same measurement length.Firstly, our attack plan provides to resolve the problem of multidimensionality. We want to summarize all the information stored in sensor data all in one significative series. This latest step will enable us to easy cluster our individuals in groups.There is a great variety of techniques which enable to reduce dimensionality in data, but our attention focused on Deep Learning algorithms. A neural network structure will permit us to handle easily our initial data: I remember you that we have 20 individuals and for every individual, we have 3 positional series of movements of length 170 (pythonic speaking we have an array of dimensions 20x170x3). The classical PCA based methods don‚Äôt permit us to carry out this kind of problem, so we built our handmade Autoencoder in Keras which takes care of our infamous original data structure.Above I‚Äôve shown the architecture I‚Äôve used: the TimeDistributed layer permits to deal with 3D data where the dimension of the index one will be considered to be the temporal dimension. For our experiment, we use the first 10 individuals to train our Autoencoder and utilize the rest to compute error reconstructions with the relative predictions. Don‚Äôt forget to standardize your data before to feed your Autoencoder! In our case, I‚Äôve standardized the data for every person by single observation (by rows).Our final reconstruction errors look like similar to this one below, where we have points near zeros when we are confident and we are able the detect the activity of this selected person; while we have high value when our model doesn‚Äôt learn enough and it has not so much confidence to reconstruct the walking activity.At this point, we have at disposal manageable objects (with dimension 175x1 for 20 individuals) and we are ready to proceed with clustering. Technically speaking, we operate hierarchical clustering on reconstruction errors of our test individuals. In order to catch important relationships among these series, we try two different instruments to assemble our clusters.At the first stage, our choice involved the adoption of the Pearson Correlation index. Unfortunately, this measure is very OVERSTIMATED and ABUSED in statistics and machine learning fields, but we want to give it a chance‚Ä¶After obtaining the correlation matrix, we operate directly on it performing the hierarchical clustering. We apply a high threshold (99% of the highest pairwise distance between sensor series) to form our flat clusters. This will result in the creation of high-level groups, small in number, but which give us a first impressive overview of our test data.Looking at color intensities of the correlation matrix (on which we‚Äôve just operated clustering procedures), we can‚Äôt see obvious group patterns. On the right, the cut (black line) of the dendrogram, after some initial ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô, doesn‚Äôt create rational groups. Male and female are mixed together without logic!The Pearson Correlation index confirms again its unreliability, we have to go another way‚Ä¶Recently, I‚Äôve read about Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic and this has produced a double effect to me: it has reminded me of the university and it has stolen my attention for its adaptability. This statistic, with the relative p-value, is used to measure the difference in distribution among two samples. I think that our clustering task is a good field of application for this killer instrument.Compute this statistic is very easy with python and, in order to use it in our case, we only have to create the Kolmogorov Smirnov Matrix (equivalent to the Correlation Matrix) and reproduce the same steps we‚Äôve done above.Now, looking at the color intensity of our matrix (on which we‚Äôve just operated clustering procedures), we can observe the presence of a pattern among females and males. As clearly visible in the dendrogram on the right, our hierarchical procedure has created two sensible groups, where men are all separated from women. The ‚Äòuncertainty‚Äô, at the beginning of clusters building, is also disappeared.This is the result we want, which confirms the importance of the presence of Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic in the arsenal of every data scientist.In this post, we‚Äôve solved simultaneously a problem of dimensionality reduction and clustering for time series data. We‚Äôve utilized an Autoencoder to summarize (in form of reconstruction errors) the relevant characteristics of the accelerometers. With our one-dimensional series, we‚Äôve carried out a clustering partition among individuals. The most satisfying results come from the combination of Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic and hierarchical clustering, confirming again that Pearson Correlation must be handled with caution.CHECK MY GITHUB REPOKeep in touch: Linkedin",25/07/2019,1,2,5,1,889,395,5,0,0,7,178
Dependency Parser or how to find syntactic neighbours of a word,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/dependency-parser-or-how-to-find-syntactic-neighbours-of-a-word-a9e7d17ffe8,C√¥me Cothenet,28,6,909,"This article will go through the theory to demystify this insufficiently known part of NLP. Then, in a second article, we will suggest tools to help you understand how to easily implement a Dependency Parser.When we think about a word‚Äôs neighbors, we could think about the neighborhood as their location in a sentence, their relation to other words (subject, determinant, etc.), called syntax, or as their meaning similarity, called semantics. What interests us here is the syntactical neighborhood.First, let‚Äôs define some vocabulary to make it clearer for everyone.A Dependency Tree is a structure that can be defined as a directed graph, with |V| nodes (vertices), corresponding to the words, and |A| Arcs, corresponding to the syntactic dependencies between them. We may also want to attribute labels to dependencies, called relations. These relations give details about the dependency type (e.g. Subject, Direct Object Complement, Determinant‚Ä¶). You can find all the relations from Universal Dependencies by following this link : https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/index.html.In an arc h ‚Üí d, h is the head and d is the dependent. The head is the most important node in a phrase, while the Root is the most important node in the whole sentence: it is directly or indirectly the head of every other node.A Dependency Parser simply transforms a sentence into a Dependency Tree.An accurate Dependency Parser recognizes the dependencies and relations between words well. Two Metrics (scores) are useful for this: - Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS), which corresponds to the number of correctly predicted dependencies over the number of possibilities;- Labeled Attachment Score (LAS), which corresponds to the number of correctly predicted dependencies and relations over the number of possibilities.LAS is always less than or equal to UAS, because an incorrect dependency leads to a suboptimal UAS and LAS, while an incorrect relation (or label) only leads to a LAS decreasing.As you might have thought, we could create a Dependency Parser through rules developed by linguists. These parsers are called Rationalists. They are not at all efficient, since languages are very complex, and they change over time. Any small change in the language would lead to tremendous changes in the parser. Machine Learning allows for the development of Empiric parsers, which are data driven. Fed by many sentences, probabilities of dependencies or relations can be drawn. Linguistic knowledge may be used, but does not have the last word, which is a good point if you, like me, have forgotten your primary school lessons‚Ä¶Several steps are needed to create a Dependency Parser. Our inputs are the words of the sentence with their properties (index, Part of Speech tag, Lemma, Features); then, we must calculate features for all possible arcs in the sentence. Thanks to these features, we compute a score for each possibility, and we finally decode scores with a decoder.Features and ScoreEach word in the sentence has some attributes, like Part of Speech tags or Lemmas. You might know them if you have already read about NLP. You can check it out here, if not:With these features, we train a Machine Learning regression model that returns the score to be exploited by the decoder.Feature selection is crucial, and some models allow us to bypass this part via a deep learning part. This is the case with the algorithm we will present in the following section.There are a lot of different decoders already developed. However, we can divide them into two categories: Transition-based decoders and Graph-based ones. Transition-based decoders are faster and need less memory to decode scores, but they are generally less accurate than Graph-based decoders. I will only go through Graph-based model principles in this article.Other algorithms can apply different transitions, but this one allows us to understand the main principle.Graph-Based DecodersIt is necessary to deal with graph theory to understand these algorithms.A graph G=(V, A) is a set of vertices V (called also nodes), that represent the tokens, and arcs (i, j)‚àà A where i, j ‚àà V. The arcs represent the dependencies between two words.In a Graph-based dependency parser, graphs are directed, which means links have different directions, and there can be multiple arcs between nodes, this is called a multi-digraph.You can note that some arrows are thicker than others. This represents the weight of arcs. The more an arc weighs, the stronger the link between two nodes. We could interpret this as the strength of the syntactic dependency for our parser. For Example, C and A seem to be very dependent on B, but B does not seem very dependent on C and A.Graph G is too connected. In order to get a Dependency Tree, we want:Fortunately, all of this already has a name: what we want is a Spanning Tree!If I was clear on what a Spanning Tree is, you should know that there are multiple possibilities, since we only have a few conditions to get one. Here comes a trick: we want the best one, certainly, but how could we determine the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one?We have 3 nodes here, and we want to keep them. However, we have 6 arcs and we want to keep only 2. The ‚Äúbest‚Äù Dependency Tree is the one that has the highest weights: this is called the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST).This Maximum Spanning Tree gives us our Dependency Tree, which we will use to find the closest syntactic neighbors in the sentence.The insight given here is very light compared to the different existing algorithms. However, this should improve your intuition when developing your Dependency Parser.",25/07/2019,0,0,14,0,355,263,6,3,0,3,270
Speeding up data wrangling with dtplyr,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-dtplyr-783d89e9ae56,Eryk Lewinson,10200,4,602,"I recently saw a Tweet by Hadley Wickham about the release of dtplyr. It is a package that enables working with dplyr syntax on data.table objects. dtplyr automatically translates the dplyr syntax to thedata.table equivalent, which in the end results in a performance boost.Marvel: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover event in history.Hadley Wickham: Hold my beer.I always liked the ease and readability of dplyr and was eager to compare the performance of the package. Let‚Äôs see how it works in practice!For this article, we need to install dtplyr from GitHub by runningdevtools::install_github(‚Äútidyverse/dtplyr‚Äù) and we use microbenchmark for performance comparison.We generate an artificial dataset. The first thing that came to my mind is an order registry, in which we store:As this is only a toy example, we do not dive deeply into the logic behind the dataset. We can agree that it vaguely resembles a real-life scenario. For testing the performance of different approaches, we generate 10 million rows of data.By using lazy_dt() we trigger the lazy evaluation ‚Äî no computation is performed until we explicitly request it by using as.data.table(), as.data.frame() or as_tibble(). For the sake of comparison, we store one data.frame, one data.table and one ‚Äúlazy‚Äù data.table.We can preview the transformation, as well as the generated data.table code by printing the result:Generally, this should be used for debugging. We should indicate what kind of object we want to receive at the end of the pipeline to clearly show that we are done with the transformations.Let‚Äôs say we want to have a list of transactions that happened before 2019‚Äì02‚Äì01, sorted by date, and we do not care about either the amount or price.We see that dtplyr is slightly slower than data.table, but by looking at the median time it is ~4x faster than dplyr.In this example, we want to filter orders with a number of products over 5000 and calculate the order value, which is amount * price.Most of the expressions using mutate() must make a copy (do not modify in-place), which would not be necessary when using data.table directly. To counter for that, we can specify immutable = FALSE in lazy_dt() to opt-out of the mentioned behavior.This time the difference is not so pronounced. This, of course, depends on the complexity of operations done to the tables.Let‚Äôs say we want to:This time we get ~3x improvement in median execution time.In the last example, we consider a case of joining datasets. For that, we create a new data.frame/data.table called product by selecting 75% of the available products and assigning a random letter to them. We can assume that the letter corresponds to a distribution center (variable called origin), from which the item is shipped.We want to calculate the average order value per distribution center. In case we do not have data regarding the distribution center, we discard the row.Again we see a ~3x speedup in the median execution time.dtplyr is (and always will be) slightly slower than data.table. That is because:1. Each dplyr verb must be converted to a data.table equivalent. For large datasets, this should be negligible, as these translation operations take time proportional to the complexity of the input code, rather than the amount of data.2. Some data.table expressions have no direct dplyr equivalent. 3. Immutability issue mentioned in use-case 2.Summing up, I believe that dtplyr is a valuable addition to the tidyverse, as with only small changes to the dplyr code, we can achieve significant performance improvements.As always, any constructive feedback is welcome.

Multi-Class Imbalance,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-imbalance-154ef2b15816,Christopher George DeSantis,76,5,738,"So, for my first write-up, I am tackling a problem I encountered whilst working on my first data science project at my company. I work as a machine learning researcher at ALC- Innovative Transportation Solutions and my problem arose during a predictive modeling project. Multi-class imbalance. I had encountered class imbalance before in classroom projects and had employed the use of the ROSE package but never had I been exposed to a multi-class imbalance issue.Binary class-imbalance is a common headache in data science but can be easily solved(great article about it: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/). Unfortunately for this project I had on my hands, there weren‚Äôt as many resources. I wanted to share my thought process for overcoming multi-class imbalance so someone else might find it useful in mediating their own distribution conflicts.The DistributionMy company‚Äôs data is not open for sharing but here is a simulated version of the issue I was facing:This data distribution across classes is completely imbalanced. This is bad because the goal of my project is to build a multi-class classifier that can correctly assign what ‚ÄòClass‚Äô a data point belongs to. Specifically, this imbalance is an issue because the predictive model, whichever I end up pursuing, would be biased towards Class1 and, to less of a degree but still, Class2. It would achieve decent accuracy by classifying the majority of the train and test set as Class1 or Class2 because of the imbalance; this is the ‚ÄòAccuracy Paradox.‚Äô My model might achieve good accuracy on classification but that‚Äôs because the model would only be modelling the imbalanced distribution.This issue is compounded by the fact that the distinguishing characteristics between the classes is quite thin, in the case of my actual work project. Their longitude/latitude features are only different by a minuscule amount. Sure, there are other predictive features but Geo-spatial data makes up the bulk of the predictive and interpret-ability aspects of the model. Yet, this difference in classes is important to the company and the decision making of the model and therefore this issue must be tackled.ROSEROSE, or the Random Over Sampling Experiment, is a fantastic R package that deals with class imbalance quite well, but only binary class imbalance (two classes). How could I use this package to fix the multi-class data I was looking at?After trial-and-error, researching of options, and dropping a quick email to one of my great professors I determined the best course of action: writing a function that takes the whole data set, divides it up into 6 subsets using ‚ÄòClass‚Äô as the dividing feature, and then use ROSE to balance those subsets out to my desired distribution. Then they would be compiled back into one, reasonably balanced data set. Each subset contains Class1 and then one of the minority classes. Class2 was left out because it‚Äôs not under-represented.The subset is then given to a ROSE argument to over-sample the minority class. The ROSE code for doing so can be seen below. The identity of the minority class is used as the formula and the ‚Äòp‚Äô argument is the probability of sampling the rare class, an alternative is setting N to the desired size of the data set. Below, with p=0.5, these arguments return a data set where the minority class is now represented in 50% of the data.After over-sampling the minority class and bringing the distribution out of imbalanced hell I ran this balanced data set through my classifier. The best model was a Random Forest (compared against a logistic regression model as the baseline, a gini-criteria decision tree, an information-gain decision tree, and a neural network). The results were great, but not so great on the test set. Why? Because the over-sampled minority class data weren‚Äôt new data points. So the model couldn‚Äôt conceive that new points could fit into that class.I considered using SMOTE, synthetic-minority over-sampling technique but it‚Äôs results were negligible at best. I settled on using the ROSE formula in the ROSE package which: ‚Äúcreates a sample of synthetic data by enlarging the features space of minority and majority class examples‚Äù (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROSE/ROSE.pdf).By sticking to my original method of subset creation and applying ROSE I got back synthetic yet balanced data samples and compiled a new data set. I trained all the models on a simple random sample 70:30 train/test split of the data. The accuracy was high, and the models responded very well to new data points as they come in from my company‚Äôs server.",25/07/2019,2,2,2,0,583,345,6,0,0,1,109
A gentle introduction to Recommendation Systems,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-recommendation-systems-eaddcbde07ce,Gonzalo Ferreiro Volpi,1700,11,1758,"If you are here, reading about Recommendation Systems, surely you already know what we‚Äôll be talking about, so maybe you can just jump over this brief chapter. But if you came here attracted by the cover image, or if you want to know more about how Recommendation Systems emerged and grew up in the last years, then stay tunned with this section of the article.Let‚Äôs go back in time and try to picture this: it‚Äôs Friday night and you want to rent a videotape in your closest Blockbuster. You head over there with your girlfriend, already talking about which movie are you going to rent. Maybe a comedy? Or perhaps an action movie? A thunderstorm is coming, what settles the perfect mood for a horror movie or a thriller.While you‚Äôre thinking, your girlfriend tells you: ‚Äòdid you search for any good recommendation on the Internet?‚Äô. Unfortunately, the Internet was down all day at your job, and anyway, you‚Äôre still trying to get yourself around with all that mumbo jumbo around the World Wide Web.You finally arrive there, but after almost an hour of deliberations, you still don‚Äôt know what to chose. You already saw all the popular movies, and the premier section of the store is full of crap. You don‚Äôt want to be nitpicking, but there‚Äôs just nothing good. Your girlfriend asks the Blockbuster mate behind the desk, but he seems to know less about movies than your grandpa, and he is really not down with the kids. It‚Äôs already getting late and you‚Äôre knackered, so long story short, you decide to rent a good old movie you already saw. Is better to keep it sound and safe, than winging about your Friday‚Äôs night plan.This example may seem old, but in so many aspects of life, people keep making decisions in a similar way. I can assure you that my grandpa doesn‚Äôt use Google when he wants to buy a book for himself. However, and luckily for the youngsters, the decision making today in many cases is safer (I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd dare to say easier, or quicker), since a simple search on Google gives us dozens or even hundreds of reviews. However, online retailers want to keep you inside their site. They don‚Äôt want you going out of their webpage, searching for some review that may lead you to another retailer to buy that gadget you were looking for. Or even, suspending a purchase because of not being able to solve or to find whatever you were looking for.In this context, Recommendations Systems have emerged as a way of maintaining the audience inside a website or application. So first and foremost, it‚Äôs important to understand that it is a tool for merchants sick and tired of losing customers. Of course, as a result, merchants are trying to keep their customers happy with good recommendations, otherwise, this tool wouldn‚Äôt work at all. So in the end, it‚Äôs a win-win for both parts: the retailer and the customer.Usually, Recommendation Systems use our previous activity to make specific recommendations for us. Now, if we‚Äôre visiting an e-commerce for the first time, it won‚Äôt know anything about us, so how can it make a decent recommendation? The most basic solution would be to recommend the best selling products, some latest releases, maybe a classic collection if we are talking about movies or books, or we could even recommend the products which would give the maximum profit to the business. However, building a smart Recommendation System has the potential to increase sales and business performance, so companies are going beyond these classic techniques to build better and stronger Recommendation Systems.When we try to recommend items to users, we face a few fundamental challenges:To face all this, regularly we‚Äôll talk about users and items. In most cases, we are going to predict a certain rating for each possible pair of user and item. And if the user already gave some rating we can compare it to our prediction:There are basically two kinds of approaches:This alternative recommends similar products to the ones each specific user has already liked in the past. Take the case of recommending a book, very linear way of seeing it would be that if a user has liked the book ‚ÄòHarry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone‚Äô and he hasn‚Äôt ranked ‚ÄòHarry Potter and the Cursed Child‚Äô, we could recommend him the latter.Content-Based filtering uses a specific similarity measure. A similarity measure is not more than a metric to obtain the distance between vectors of users or items. It is a very extensive mathematical concept by its own, so we‚Äôre not going to talk more about it in this article (I might write more about it in the future though, so stay tuned). But for example, we could use the cosine similarity to measure the distance in between our items vectors, arrange them in descending order, and then use one of the following approaches for recommending items to any given user:The greatest problem of this technique is that it will always be limited to the same type of items the user bought or ranked in the past. So, following our books example, if the user never bought a business-related book before, it would never recommend one from this category.This part of the article is heavily based on content from Analytics Vidhya, since as almost everything in there, is perfectly explained and I wouldn‚Äôt like to reinvent the wheel :)Having said that, to understand this algorithm let‚Äôs continue with our example about books: suppose I like the following books: ‚ÄòThe blind assassin‚Äô and ‚ÄòA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äô. And my friend Matias likes ‚ÄòThe blind assassin‚Äô and ‚ÄòA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äô as well, but also ‚ÄòWhere the crawdads sing‚Äô. It seems that Matias and I have both the same interests. So you could probably affirm I would like ‚ÄòWhere the crawdads sing‚Äô too, even though I didn‚Äôt read it. And this is exactly the logic behind collaborative filtering, with the only exception that you can compare users in between them, or compare items. Let‚Äôs see how each method works:This case is exactly as the example we just mentioned. If user A likes or buys the same items as user B, then we can recommend items user A liked, but user B didn‚Äôt like yet. Or vice versa. And we‚Äôre going to find this resemblance in between them by using similarity measures to compare both users vector for the whole spectrum of items ranked/bought/liked:The prediction Pu,i is given by:Where:This may seem easy in our books example but imagine now that your Amazon and you have hundreds of thousands of users and ratings. Thinking about computational problems? Well, you‚Äôre right: this algorithm is heavy in such cases. To solve this, companies use to implement a neighbours logic, to select only a fixed number of users to make predictions, instead of using them all. We can do this in several ways:However, this algorithm is quite time-consuming as it involves calculating the similarity for each user and then calculating a prediction for each similarity score. One way of handling this problem is to select only a few users (neighbours) instead of all to make predictions, i.e. instead of making predictions for all similarity values, we choose only few similarity values. There are several ways to select neighbours:In case of selecting of looking at the k most similar users, the predictions equations would be transformed into the following:Here ùëÅùëòùëñ(ùë¢) denotes the ùëò most similar users to user ùë¢ who rated item ùëñ.As an example, let‚Äôs take user similarity (e.g. correlation similarity) and we‚Äôll consider the two nearest neighbours of user 1:In this algorithm, we compute the similarity between each pair of items:In this case, the algorithm would be recommending me ‚ÄòWhere the crawdads sing‚Äô again, but only because either Matias, Victoria and I, the three of us liked ‚ÄòThe blind assassin‚Äô, while ‚ÄòWhere the crawdads sing‚Äô is the only boked liked by both, Matias and Victoria. So in this case, instead of taking the weighted sum of ratings of ‚Äúuser-neighbours‚Äù, we take the weighted sum of ratings of ‚Äúitem-neighbours‚Äù. And the predictions then is given by:Finally, to apply some of the concepts we just saw, we‚Äôll revisit the very popular movielens dataset (available in my GitHub account), applying a combination of techniques from Analytics Vidhya and some others from my Immersive Course of General Assembly with the same dataset:The movielens dataset contains different tables:Let‚Äôs take a look at this last one:Now that we know all that, let‚Äôs move step by step to get our predictions:First, we need to create a user-item matrix to be used to calculate the similarity between users and items:Now we‚Äôll create a matrix full of zeros and then we‚Äôll go by every line in ratings, filling the user row and the movie column, with the rating:Now, we will calculate the similarity. Regular Cosine Similarity by the definition reflects differences in direction, but not the location. Therefore it does not consider the difference in ratings of users. Adjusted cosine similarity instead offsets this drawback by subtracting the average rating. So we‚Äôll create a function to find the Adjusted Cosine Similarity:Now let‚Äôs find our users and items similarity:An finally, let‚Äôs make our predictions:As you can see we used np.newaxis so that mean_user_rating has the same format as ratings. Find more about np.newaxis here.Let‚Äôs check the shape of our predictions matrices:Just to finish, and completely apart from making our Recommendation System, let‚Äôs create a function using the predictions previously created. It will find the movies not rated by the user (and therefore not seen) and give us the top 5 ranked movies according to our predictions.Let‚Äôs test it with a random user.Wow, that‚Äôs amazing! We managed to already obtain our first recommendations for any given user. Of course, Recommendation Systems is a very broad topic and there‚Äôs much more we could talk about it: Similarity Measures, performance evaluation, more sophisticated techniques to obtain recommendations, and more! I‚Äôll be probably writing more about all this in the future, but meanwhile, feel free to check my GitHub account, where I have some neat projects, including the complete Recommendation Systems project with the movielens dataset :)By the way, if you‚Äôre interested in Recommendation Systems, check out my last article about Improving your Recommendations System using Singular Value Decomposition and more in my writer profile in Towards Data Science.

A ConvNet that works well with 20 samples: Wavelet Scattering,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-convnet-that-works-on-like-20-samples-scatter-wavelets-b2e858f8a385,lihan yao,61,10,2067,"Often in data-constrained scenarios, scene comprehension has to occur with few time series observations - whether that‚Äôs audio, visual, or even radar. We do this using a surprisingly underrated technique called wavelet scattering.Wavelet scattering (or scatter transform) generates a representation that‚Äôs invariant to data rotation/translation and stable to deformations of your data. Uninformative variations in your data are discarded ‚Äî e.g. an audio sample time-shifted by various amounts. Information for downstream tasks like classification is preserved. Wavelet scattering requires no training and works great with low data.Its main computation is convolution, making it fast and applicable to images and 1D signals. We focus on signals in this article. We will retrace findings by the signal processing community and relate it to modern machine learning concepts. I show that, yes, we can do great without learning, using 20 samples. Recreate experiments and illustrations in this article with the colab notebook in this link.A wavelet can be convolved with the signal in the same sense that filters can. I think of convolution as the continuous analog to inner products, where large activation (commonly said in ML) or wavelet coefficient is caused by similarity between the continuous objects. By convolving elements from a dictionary to the signal under inspection, we capture local, spatial dependencies.Convolution is a pivotal computation in the emergence of deep learning ‚Äî it is extremely fast. The wavelet scattering implementation used by this article calls a deep learning backend solely for the efficient convolution! Kymatio is a great Python package built by passionate researchers that implement wavelet scattering, leveraging the PyTorch framework.The basic building block of wavelet scattering is the Morlet wavelet. It is a Gaussian windowed sinusoid with deep connections to mammal hearing and vision. By convolving wavelets œà·µ• indexed by different frequency locations v, the wavelet transform of x is the set of scatter coefficients{ x ‚àó œà·µ• }·µ•When the wavelet‚Äôs sine component has room to dilate (sine wave ‚Äòslowing‚Äô its oscillation), it decomposes the signal at decorrelated scales. That‚Äôs good for revealing the signal‚Äôs frequency structure, but doing so over the course of a longer time range. The consequence is that a wider Gaussian window trades temporal resolution for increased frequency resolution ( itself a consequence of Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle). In practice, the width of the Gaussian window that tapers the sine wave is an important parameter [M. Cohen 2018].The historic context of wavelet scattering starts with Fourier transform, the canonical signal processing technique. The shortcoming of Fourier representation includes its instability to signal deformations at high frequency. For a signal x perturbed slightly by a high frequency deformation into xÃÉ, their spectrogram representations look different ( large ‚Äñ FFT(x) -FFT(xÃÉ) ‚Äñ ) even if they remain similar signals to the human eye. This instability is due to sine wave‚Äôs inability to localize frequency information, since sine itself has non-localized support.Wavelet transform fixes this by decomposing the signal with a family of wavelets, with various dilation, where every wavelet has localized support (flattening out eventually like the Morlet wavelet). The resulting wavelet representation localizes high frequency components of the signal. Yet because the wavelet operator commutes with translations, the resulting representation becomes translation covariant ‚Äî shifting a signal also shifts its wavelet coefficients. This makes comparison between translated signals difficult, and translation invariance is key to tasks like classification. How do we achieve a signal representation Œ¶(x) that is translation invariant, stable under deformations, and offers good structural information at all frequencies?Wavelet scattering builds a signal representation Œ¶(x) with a redundant dictionary of Morlet wavelets. While the space of signals X can be really high dimensional, the transform forms a kernel metric over the space of signals, inducing a lower dimensional manifold. Watch St√©phane Mallat discuss the manifold interpretation with visualization.Readers have probably trained a neural convolution network to encode an image into a latent manifold Z, whose code/latent representation is used for classification or structure discovery ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what is happening in analogy. Wavelet scattering encodes the dataset X where uninformative variability in X: translation, rotation, and scaling ‚Äî the action of groups ‚Äî are discarded in the process.The key benefits of transforming a signal by Œ¶ [J. Bruna and S. Mallat, 2013] is thatŒ¶ is invariant to signal translation.Denote by x‚Çú a signal identical to x, except translated in time, then Œ¶(x) = Œ¶(x‚Çú).Œ¶ is stable under signal deformations.I.e. Œ¶ is Lipschitz continuous to deformations ‚Äî difference between scatter representations of a signal with its deformed version is linear. A deformation can be some local displacement/distortion (or a ridiculous amount of distortion, as a later example shows). For Lipschitz constant C>0 and a displacement field œÑ(u) causing deformations to create xÃÉ,‚ÄñŒ¶( x ) - Œ¶( xÃÉ )‚Äñ ‚â§ C‚Äñx‚Äñ sup·µ§|‚àáœÑ(u)|Where ‚Äñx‚Äñ= ‚à´ ‚Äñx(u)‚Äñ¬≤du and sup·µ§|‚àáœÑ(u)| is the global deformation amplitude.Œ¶ does not require learning.The priors introduced by wavelet scattering are nice enough that its performance often makes learning redundant; plus it comes with interpretable features and outputs. In data-constrained scenarios, if comparable data is publicly available, a nice plan is to pipe your small dataset through a pretrained model. But in the difficult situation that your dataset is small and unique, consider wavelet scattering as an initialization for ConvNets and other models. I suspect the future of ‚Äòdata constrained learning‚Äô will be in synergizing predefined filters alongside learned filters.Figure below illustrates stability under deformations. Left we applied scatter transform to the voice of a speaker saying ‚Äòzero‚Äô. The scatter representation consists of the coefficients derived from averaging/low pass filter, order 1 wavelets, and order 2 wavelets. Right After applying a displacement field that has mostly masked the structure of the original signal with a sine wave, Œ¶( xÃÉ ) is barely affected; the deformation‚Äôs effect has been linearized by Œ¶‚Äôs transformation.Convolution Network A scatter representation consists of order 0, 1, and 2 coefficients, which are generated by composing wavelets in different sequences. Multiple wavelets composed together capture high frequency structure, e.g. the 2nd order coefficients display wave interference ( heard as dissonance in music) within the signal. We now give a brief tour of how computation is done (the complex modulus and averaging filter is more closely explained in the appendix).At the m-th layer, the set of n pre-defined wavelets { œà·µ•‚ÇÅ , ‚Ä¶ , œà·µ•‚Çô} are convolved with coefficients from the (m-1)-th layer, belonging to a previous wavelet œà·µ•·µê‚Åª¬π. So in the figure above, a row of order 2 coefficients results from convolving with œà·µ•¬π in layer 1, then œà·µ•¬≤ in layer 2.Altogether we denote a sequence of wavelets as a length M path p = (œà·µ•¬π , ‚Ä¶ , œà·µ•·¥π). By convolving then taking the complex modulus |‚ãÖ|, denote the resulting ordered product of operators U[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶, v‚Çò]. For a path of length 2,U[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ ]x =| |x ‚àó œà·µ•‚ÇÅ| ‚àó œà·µ•‚ÇÇ|To finally extract coefficients like a row in the above figure, apply an averaging filter œÜ, and call it S[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶, v‚Çò]:S[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ ]x = U[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ ]x ‚àó œÜ(u)Starting at data x as root, the set of rooted paths in this wavelet tree specify Œ¶(x). In practice, paths up to length 2 is enough to extract all relevant frequency information from naturally occurring data. So the distinguishing aspect of scatter transform over wavelet transform is exactly the order 2 coefficients.Example Task Let‚Äôs apply scatter transform to a real dataset. The Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) has 2000 recordings from 4 speakers, each speaker saying a digit 50 times. After convolving with wavelets, I plotted a 2D t-SNE projection of resulting high dimensional coefficients. Each point is an audio sample‚Äôs scatter representation Œ¶(x), colored by digit class.In time series classification tasks, rivaling techniques include dynamic time warping, Hidden Markov Models, and neural models like LSTMs and RNNs. Let us see how wavelet scattering perform, even under extremely data-constrained situations. As preprocessing, we Z-normalize the audio samples. Then audio samples are 0-padded to uniform length and ~20 audio samples are dropped to ensure scatter representations have the same dimensions. Continuing in the practice of not learning, we use 3-nearest neighbors as the classifier. 3NN(Œ¶(x)) predicts the i-th digit if at least 2 neighbors closest to Œ¶(x) in the training set belong to digit i, or closest neighbor is i ( a possibility during three-way ties).With 1981 samples, we find that 3-fold classification accuracy is 91.5%, and with a training set of 20 samples, with all other observations in the held-out set, we reach 49%. Not bad, considering I only tried different values for the Q hyperparameter (number of wavelets per octave), and left other dials alone. Try different values for the scale parameter J in the attached notebook.I‚Äôm finished with motivating wavelet scattering. At this point, I would love it if you started exploring the technique on your own, maybe starting with my digit audio jupyter notebook. The appendix go into key properties surrounding wavelet scattering like how to leverage Œ¶(x) when x is an image, and practical considerations.Credits They say it takes a dev team to raise a Medium article. This would not be possible without Kymatio researchers and developers, including Edouard, Vincent, and Michael. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to explain and leverage this amazing technology at Geometric Data Analytics, under the guidance of Paul Bendich, in collaboration with government agencies.Actually, given a path p = ( œà·µ•‚ÇÅ , œà·µ•‚ÇÇ ), extracting the 2nd order coefficients also requires the complex modulus | ·êß | and averaging filter œÜ:S[ v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ ]x(u) =||x ‚àó œà·µ•‚ÇÅ| ‚àó œà·µ•‚ÇÇ|‚àó œÜ(u)Stephane Mallat explains the predecessors to wavelet scattering, then the need for complex modulus and averaging filter.The complex modulus is the secret sauce of wavelet scattering. | ·êß | is a non-linearity applied to coefficients that makes them 1) stable to diffeomorphisms and 2) stable in the euclidean metric L¬≤. The complex modulus makes Œ¶(x) Lipschitz continuous with respect to deformations. Visually, the modulus forms an upper envelope over the coefficients.Whenever œÜ is applied to coefficients |x ‚àó œà·µ•|, we accept the removal of the high frequency component in order to localize the bin covering the lower spectrum ( discarding the phase of |x ‚àó œà·µ• |) . To preserve high frequency information, scatter transform propagates high frequency information further down the wavelet path p before localizing its distinct frequency bin via œÜ.Wavelet Scattering for Images The 2D Morlet wavelets may be convolved two-directionally with image data. In addition to the dilation parameter, the 2D wavelets can be rotated.For example, researchers have found wavelet scattering to excel at classification of images of texture, where the major obstacles are finding a representation that is ‚Äòzoom‚Äô, translation and rotation invariant ‚Äî as soon as these group actions are factored out from the sample generation process, texture classification is straightforward. It is precisely these variabilities that wavelet scattering discount.Parametrizing Wavelet Dictionary When the wavelet‚Äôs sine component has room to dilate (sine wave ‚Äòslowing‚Äô its oscillation), it decomposes the signal at decorrelated scales. That‚Äôs good for revealing the signal‚Äôs frequency structure, but doing so over the course of a longer time range. The consequence is that a wider Gaussian window trades temporal resolution for increased frequency resolution (itself a consequence of Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle). In practice, the width of the Gaussian window that tapers the sine wave is an important parameter [M. Cohen 2018].A wavelet dictionary in this article is parametrized by J, the maximum log scale and Q, the number of wavelets per octave. Increasing J trades temporal resolution for frequency resolution by increasing wavelet width by a factor of 2^J. A large J means a ‚Äòlong‚Äô wavelet that emits fewer wavelet coefficients, leading to shorter wavlet representations.‚ÄúFor audio signals, it is often beneficial to have a large value for Q (between 4 and 16), since these signals are often highly oscillatory and are better localized in frequency than they are in time.‚Äù ‚Äî kymatio tutorialFor signal processing practitioners, scatter transform‚Äôs wavelets form a non-orthogonal, redundant dictionary.Signal energy is conserved Composition of wavelet convolutions preserves the signal norm, or essentially the signal energy. This follows from the fact that wavelet transform is a contracting and invertible operator. Energy within the original signal is converted to ‚Äòcoefficient energy‚Äô by the averaging filter after every convolution along a path. For the Caltech-101 image database, [J. Bruna and S. Mallat, 2013] shows ~99% of the signal energy has been conserved by networks of depth 3, for any value of J.",25/07/2019,2,0,30,82,932,672,6,0,0,18,278
Sentiment Analysis: a practical benchmark,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-a-benchmark-903279cab44a,"Michel Kana, Ph.D",5200,5,693,"With hands-on practical Python code, we demonstrate limitations of simple recurrent neural networks and show how embeddings improve fully connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks for the classification of sentiment.We show how to work with sequence data, by doing sentiment classification on a movie review dataset. Sentiments are basically feelings which include emotions, attitude and opinions written in natural language.We start by loading the IMDB dataset using Keras API. The reviews are already tokenized. We want to have a finite vocabulary to make sure that our word matrices are not arbitrarily small. We also want to have a finite length of reviews and not have to process really long sentences. Our training dataset has 25,000 customer reviews, together with their correct labels (either positive or negative).Above you can see a sample review as a list of numbers, also called word vector. Each number represents the index of a word in the vocabulary. If you need a deeper understanding about text representation for machine learning, you might want to have a look at the following article before moving on.towardsdatascience.comThe code below can be used to display reviews in plain text, by converting the word vectors back to text. We run the code for a sample positive and a sample negative review.A sentence can be thought of as a sequence of words which have semantic connections across time. By semantic connection, we mean that the words that occur earlier in the sentence influence the sentence‚Äôs structure and meaning in the latter part of the sentence. There are also semantic connections backwards in a sentence, in an ideal case. They are usually captured by feeding sentences into a model in reverse order.Recurrent neural networks can be used to extract, recognize, or characterize the sentiment content of the text and to classify it as positive or negative.towardsdatascience.comWe are going to compare this approach to a fully connected neural network, a convolutional neural network and the combination of both.The code below ran ca. 2 hours on a GPU instance on Google Cloud.The classification accuracy on unseen movie reviews (test data set) is shown in the table above. Surprisingly, the fully connected neural network with embeddings outperforms the remaining networks. It is a single layer network with 250 nodes fully connected. The convolutional neural network has similar accuracy. Although CNNs were designed to honor the spatial structure in image data whilst being robust to the position and orientation of learned objects in the scene, this same principle can be used on sequences, such as the one-dimensional sequence of words in a movie review. The same properties that make the CNN model attractive for learning to recognize objects in images can help to learn structure in paragraphs of words, namely the techniques invariance to the specific position of features. There is still an open debate about CNNs vs RNNs in the research community. In the case of movie reviews classification, a simple RNN was useful in processing the sequence data, compared to a fully connected network without embeddings.Below we test our models on free text reviews. Each review is first tokenized, then converted into a word vector, which is used for prediction.The probability for a positive review is chosen to be greater than 0.5.The fully connected neural network with embeddings gets all four sentiments right, while the remaining models have false positives and negatives. The performance of our RNN and CNN could be surely improved by increasing the number of training epochs on a stronger GPU machine.In this article we demonstrated how neural networks solve a classification problem on movies review while benchmarking a fully connected approach with convolutional neural networks. Simple RNN is a ‚Äúreally deep‚Äù feedforward network (when unrolled in time). Additionally to issues with exploding and vanishing gradients, in practice, they are not able to learn long-term dependencies. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. They were not covered here, neither were Naive Bayes, which is a probabilistic approach to sentiment analysis.Two of the best blogs that help understand the workings of a RNN and LSTM are:You can also look at my other articles explaining LSTMs in details and deep learning in general.towardsdatascience.comtowardsdatascience.com",25/07/2019,0,0,2,0,,,6,1,0,6,85
The Little Robot that Lived at the Library,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-little-robot-that-lived-at-the-library-90431f34ae2c,Minja Axelsson,50,9,1645,"Our team at Futurice designed and built a social robot to guide people to books at Helsinki‚Äôs new central library, Oodi. Opened in 2018, Oodi is the biggest of Helsinki‚Äôs 37 public libraries. It has 10,000 visitors a day, and an estimated 2 million visitors a year (compared to Finland‚Äôs 5.5 million population, that is a significant portion).Oodi is big on automation and robotics. It has an automatic returns system: customers set their books on a conveyor belt, which brings the books to the basement, where they get sorted into boxes, which are picked up by a mobile MiR200 robot, which brings the books to the 3rd floor. At the 3rd floor, librarians place the books back on the shelves.At the start of our project, we brainstormed how Oodi could use social robots: helping kids learn to read, instructing people on using equipment such as 3D printers, giving information about the library in several languages, and helping people find their way at the library.We eventually settled on a robot that would help customers find the books and book categories they want. Since Oodi is so big, customers have a hard time getting around, and library employees spend a significant amount of time advising people how to find things. But this is not the work librarians are meant to be doing, or want to be doing. Librarians are very knowledgeable about literature. Their expertise is better used in in-depth service, helping visitors find specific books that fit their needs best. This type of work can take 30‚Äì40 minutes. In comparison, ‚ÄúWhere is the psychology section?‚Äù takes 1‚Äì3 minutes to answer. Stacked together, a whole day of 1‚Äì3 minute tasks becomes tedious, and a waste of skills.This is where the robot steps (or rather, rolls) in. A whole day of menial tasks would not bother a robot. We realized we could re-purpose the MiR200 mobile robots that the library already had, and was using to move books between the basement and the 3rd floor.The robot would have the advantage of being able to access Oodi‚Äôs database directly, and provide real-time information on which books are currently on the shelf. The robot could be more approachable to people who have social anxiety, and are afraid to approach library employees. Additionally, it could save both the customers‚Äô time (no need to queue for a librarian), and the librarians‚Äô time (who can help customers with more meaningful tasks).The design team, consisting of Oodi‚Äôs librarians, Oodi‚Äôs customers, and Futurice‚Äôs roboticists, defined design guidelines for the robot that would be built on top of the MiR200 robot, using these social robot co-design canvases (available as open source):The design team decided that the robot should not be too humanoid. We wanted a more abstract form for the robot, with expressive, non-speaking forms of communication. We wanted a design with a bit of imagination and whimsy.The team also wanted to make sure that the robot aligned with Oodi‚Äôs strategy and policies. The following ethical considerations were underlined:We started testing the robot at the library, mapping out appropriate routes, and building the user journey. Luckily, we had some very excited testers.The mobile robot by itself was too abstract to form a social bond with people. I wanted to give users something to look at, a sort of face. I searched for mechanical googly eyes online, finding them suitably humoristic, but not too wacky.Googly eyes bring to mind classic animation and comic book characters. There is a relation between robotics design and animation: the 12 rules of animation as defined by Disney have been previously applied to robotics (Ribeiro & Paiva, 2012). In this case, I planned the eyes to follow the rule of ‚ÄúExaggeration‚Äù. It would be used here to emphasize the robot‚Äôs expressions (looking around to indicate boredom when there‚Äôs a lack of missions), and its actions (looking to the direction it starts moving toward).Luckily, Glen Akins had posted his instructions on how to build mechanical googly eyes online https://bikerglen.com/blog/build-a-pair-of-robotic-googly-eyes/. After much fitting of wires into tiny holes, soldering, laser-cutting, and fussing with power supplies, we had a fresh pair of eyes.The eyes immediately had an effect: I noticed myself looking and smiling at them. When they looked left, I followed their gaze. It is easy to trick a human brain into thinking something is alive if it appears to be moving with intention (Heider & Simmel, 1944).Our team also figured the robot should have some internal drives to make it more social, perhaps even emotions. The coding of emotions, or affective computing, has been previously researched by several universities, namely MIT. MIT‚Äôs Cynthia Breazeal has researched where in a 3-dimensional matrix a robot‚Äôs emotions could reside (Breazeal, 2004).I took inspiration from this, and situated the robot‚Äôs emotions in a 2-dimensional matrix. While a simplification, it was accurate enough for our purposes.Emotions are approximated onto two axes: one ranging from negative valence (bad feelings) to positive valence (good feelings), and one from high arousal to low arousal (level of stimulatedness).The emotional state was initialized in the middle of the matrix, at coordinates 0,0. The robot‚Äôs emotional state moved in the matrix according to events that happened to it. If its mission succeeded, it moved toward positive valence and high arousal. If its mission failed, it moved toward negative valence. If it was unused for long periods of time, it moved toward low arousal.The robot‚Äôs internal moods affected the way it behaved. The robot‚Äôs action functions (travel.py and idle.py) queried its emotions at certain points, and changed the robot‚Äôs sounds, lights, and eye movements accordingly. If it was happy, it would chirp happily when guiding a person to a book. If it was bored, it would try to attract attention by looking around, dancing around and flashing lights (although not too disruptively, this was a library after all).You might wonder how a user benefits from a sad robot. The answer is, we‚Äôre not sure yet either. This emotion system is very experimental, and we wanted to explore how it would affect the interactions between the robot and user. We are still collecting data on this as the pilot continues.The code for the emotion system, author me, copyright Futurice, license MIT https://github.com/minjaaxelsson/oodipoc/blob/master/emotions.py:We tested the robot for 3 days. Customers were able to search for a certain book or author via an open search string, or choose certain book categories to be guided to, such as travelling and cooking. The robot attracted a lot of attention: even when people hadn‚Äôt personally sent it on a mission, they started following it when it was guiding someone else, forming bigger and bigger groups of people following a small robot around the library. Several customers even wanted to pet the robot. Reactions were mainly positive, and surprised (not counting one 60-year-old woman, who declared loudly ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt try any robot!‚Äù and walked off in a huff).A lot of customers were curious, asking questions about what the robot did, and how it worked. It attracted a lot of children: three girls made a game of taking turns asking the robot to take them somewhere. Others gathered around it in wonderment, exclaiming ‚ÄúOh look, it‚Äôs cute!‚Äù.The abstract form of the robot received positive feedback, with its googly eyes being a specific point of admiration. The fact that it was abstract and not human made it more approachable. ‚ÄúIt makes nice sounds, and doesn‚Äôt feel dangerous,‚Äù was one customer‚Äôs comment.Some even talked to the robot itself. A 50-year-old woman thanked the robot after a successful mission, saying ‚ÄúVery nice, thank you, you‚Äôre wonderful!‚Äù. The same woman remarked how smart it was to have a robot showing people around Oodi, since it‚Äôs so big. Another customer cursed the robot out, calling it a ‚ÄúCreepy McCreepface‚Äù, after it managed to sneak up on her. When she encountered it a bit later, she apologized for earlier.Visitors got involved in the future of the robot and had suggestions for improvements, such as having it help in carrying bags, or having a walker support for older people. Some hoped the robot would help them reserve a certain book if it was already checked out, or that it could help them in several languages.I am happy that Oodi‚Äôs customers had such a positive response to the robot, and adopted it as their own straight away. The robot will be developed further with Oodi. Future versions will utilize the emotion system to a further extent.Oodi‚Äôs librarians have sometimes encountered worries from their customers regarding robotics. Since Oodi has an automated returns system, some customers have worried that ‚Äúrobots are taking the librarians‚Äô jobs‚Äù. Some research shows that people‚Äôs attitudes toward robots may be becoming more negative (Gnambs & Appel, 2019).The librarians, however, do not share these concerns ‚Äî in the case of the conveyor belt accepting returns, or our robot guiding customers. During this project I interviewed 4 librarians, who all shared the opinion that they would rather avoid the repetitive physical task of accepting returns, or the repetitive guidance tasks such as ‚ÄúWhere are the fishing books?‚Äù. The guidance robot and its application was designed together with the librarians and the library‚Äôs customers, specifically to avoid designing unhelpful or even detrimental applications. This democratization of the design of robotics is something I hope to see more of in the future.Breazeal, C. (2004). Function meets style: insights from emotion theory applied to HRI.

"Predicting Lyme Disease, the Fastest Growing Infectious Disease in the U.S.",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-lyme-disease-the-fastest-growing-infectious-disease-in-the-u-s-4874ee1f5738,Tristan Bonds,34,15,3155,"300,000. That‚Äôs the number of people each year who are estimated to be infected with Lyme disease in the United States.But even more concerning, only 10% of those cases get reported annually to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That means that there‚Äôs possibly 270,000 people who get infected with this disease every year and may not even know they have it.And the number of people affected is growing too. As seen in Figure 1, the annual cases of Lyme disease have more than doubled in the last 20 years. Mostly concentrated in the Northeast and upper Midwest, it continues to spread to new counties every year.And it‚Äôs all as a result of the Black-legged tick, also known as the Deer tick. If you get bitten by an infected tick, the bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferialone, will enter your blood stream and begin its quiet destruction of your immune system.Within about a week, 70 to 80 percent of people get the characteristic ‚Äúbull‚Äôs-eye‚Äù rash, known as Erythema migrans. And this is generally followed by typical flu-like symptoms, like a fever, headache, chills, and general fatigue.This doesn‚Äôt seem like much, but if left untreated, it will cause widespread inflammation to almost every body system. Some of the symptoms include debilitating arthritis and swelling of the joints, facial paralysis, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and swelling of the brain and spinal cord leading to severe nerve pain and memory loss.But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. If diagnosed in the early stages, Lyme disease can be completely cured with certain antibiotics. It all comes down to increasing public awareness and educating healthcare providers in at-risk areas.This is where machine learning comes in. My idea was to build a classification model that could predict which U.S. counties would have a high incidence of Lyme disease. In doing so, counties at high risk could be informed by the CDC in advance in order to proactively take measures against the infection.But here‚Äôs the issue. Funding for research of Lyme disease is disproportionately lower than other diseases. Thus, there is very little research and surveillance being done on Lyme disease at the moment and publicly available data is extremely limited. That meant that I would have to build my dataset completely from scratch.Challenge accepted. Let the data wrangling commence.If you want to follow along with my code, check out my GitHub repository; I‚Äôve organized it chronologically with this article for your convenience.First, I needed to engineer my target variable. Luckily, the CDC has data on the number of reported cases per county from 2000 to 2017. Although the disease is severely under-reported as previously mentioned, this still gives a good picture of the geographic distribution of the disease.For consistency, I decided to restrict the data to only 2010‚Äì2017 because, as shown in Figure 1, there is an unusually large spike in 2009. Also, it is likely that data from many years ago is not as representative of today, so removing data before 2010 would likely be beneficial for the predictability of the model.But still, the data in this form won‚Äôt work for a classification problem. One issue is that the number of cases is heavily dependent on how many people live in each county. To solve this, I acquired county population estimate data from the Census Bureau. I then merged the datasets together and divided the number of cases per county by that county‚Äôs estimated population at the time.This resulted in a rate of Lyme disease cases per person. Now we have a metric that allows us to more reasonably compare counties to one another.There‚Äôs still one more step though. For supervised learning algorithms, the target variable must be labeled. I found out that the CDC defines a high incidence county as having 10 or more confirmed cases per 100,000 persons. This allowed me to bin the data such that anything above that cutoff was considered a high incidence county and anything below it was a low incidence county.Okay, but how do we get features for this model? I decided to dive into the research to find out.In 1998, Stafford et al. showed that tick abundance had a strong positive correlation with Lyme disease infections. So you‚Äôd think that by now we would have a well-established national tick surveillance program.Well, no. As shown above, all the CDC offers today is a qualitative map showing where the Black-legged Tick might be. Not very helpful.In the last few years, some states, like Connecticut and North Dakota, have taken the initiative themselves to measure tick concentrations , but until there is a coordinated national surveillance program, nation-wide tick population data will not exist.Luckily, there is a good proxy for this. Khatchikian et al. showed that environmental factors such as extreme winter temperatures and summer and winter precipitation directly regulate tick population dynamics. This is likely a result of the climate‚Äôs effect on acorns. If the climate is optimal for acorn growth, mice and deer populations that eat them will thrive. The ticks that live off of these host animals will also flourish as a result.This is great news, as there is a plethora of climate data available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).I soon found out though that this would be a little harder that expected because there is a limit of 10,000 API requests per day. Given that I needed data for every weather station in every U.S. county for 7 years, it would have taken me about 56 days to download all the data. Not ideal.I was able to get around this though. Fortunately, I found a page that allowed access to every Global Summary of the Year file and I downloaded all of it to my local computer. Of course, this meant that I now had data for every station in the world starting from around 1900, which amounted to approximately 78,000 CSV files, each corresponding to a particular station.Obviously, I only wanted a small percentage of that. So, I had to write code to manually parse through each CSV file.Above, you can see the general format of each file (there are many more columns that aren‚Äôt shown here). Essentially, I took the latitude and longitude from each file and used that as input for the reverse-geocoder python library, which outputs the country, state and county of that location. If it was a U.S. station, I then took only the rows from 2010 to 2017 and appended them to a global dataframe with their associated state and county as new columns.After over 24 hours of parsing, I was left with a mess of data set. First of all, there were 209 columns with cryptic names, like ‚ÄúDX90‚Äù and ‚ÄúEMSD‚Äù. I used the provided documentation to determine the meaning of each feature and then through careful research, meticulously removed the ones that weren‚Äôt relevant. I also relabeled the columns to have more understandable names.The next problem was the large number of missing values as seen in Figure 4. For whatever reason, many of the stations were not consistent in recording and/or reporting their measurements.I didn‚Äôt want to get rid of columns because then I would have lost some of the information that could have been gleaned from the climate data. So instead, I chose to impute all the missing values.Now, this is an area where we have to be super careful. We need to put in a placeholder that would be reasonably representative of the actual value.For example, let‚Äôs say that the total precipitation value for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in 2017 is missing. It is reasonable to believe that the average total precipitation of all the counties in Pennsylvania will come close to Montgomery County‚Äôs actual precipitation. And so that‚Äôs what I did for all the missing values; I found the average for that county‚Äôs state in that particular column and imputed the value.Hawaii and Washington D.C. had no data in several of the columns, so I had to remove them completely. Hawaii is geographically isolated and has no incidence of Lyme disease so there is no issue removing it. Washington D.C. is significantly smaller than any state so it should have no effect on the modeling.Alright, so now that the data was nice and clean, I was almost ready to merge the features with the target.Since I was trying to build a predictive model, I would need to use the previous year‚Äôs climate data to predict the current year‚Äôs Lyme disease incidence.To do this, I created a new column in the features data that contained the next year. I then merged the target data on that column in order to create a one year offset.Before any modeling, it‚Äôs important to check if the data will work well for the algorithms you‚Äôll be using. In the case of classification models, the classes need to be relatively balanced. That means that there should be an equal number of instances for the positive and negative classes.As seen above, this data has a significant class imbalance problem with 85% of the counties having low Lyme disease incidence and only 15% of the counties having high Lyme disease incidence.But why is this such an issue? Well, if a majority of the counties have a low Lyme disease incidence, then a model will get the best accuracy by guessing that all the counties have a low incidence. In this case, 85% of the time the model would be right. But this comes at a terrible cost of 0% accuracy for the minority class. In other words, our model would be utterly useless for the counties we care about that have a serious Lyme disease problem.I experimented with many resampling techniques to counteract this. Random undersampling is where you randomly select a small percentage of the majority class and delete the rest of the data points. This removal results in a balance of the majority class with the minority class. But this comes with the obvious downside of losing information, which could reduce the model‚Äôs predictability.Then there‚Äôs random oversampling, which randomly selects a portion of the infrequent class and just duplicates those data points. This also results in balanced classes; the caveat here is that having a bunch of rows that are exactly the same could lead to overfitting, where the model just memorizes the over-represented synthetic data and loses its generalizability to real world unseen data.That‚Äôs where Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, also known as SMOTE, comes in. Instead of just copying parts of the minority class, it seeks to create data that are similar but not exactly the same as the original data. On a high level, it randomly generates new points directly between the infrequent class‚Äôs data points, leading to completely unique synthetic data.And lastly, there‚Äôs the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach or ADASYN, which is like SMOTE but creates more synthetic data for minority class samples that are harder to learn and fewer synthetic data for minority samples that are easier to learn. This results in a distribution of synthetic data that will strengthen the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between the classes at the decision boundary.Before we can see how these techniques perform, we must partition the data. I split the data into three parts: 60% for training the different models, 20% for validating and optimizing the best model, and 20% as a test set to demonstrate the generalizability of the final model.Now we get to the fun part. I built a modeling pipeline using the imbalanced-learn python package in combination with scikit-learn‚Äôs GridSearchCV. This allowed me to do an exhaustive grid search for every combination of hyperparameters and data transformations (like scaling and resampling techniques), while also doing 5-fold cross validation to more robustly test how each combination performed.The algorithms I ran through this pipeline were:I‚Äôve provided links to helpful articles in case you are interested in learning more about each model.After optimizing each algorithm individually, I tested the resulting five models on the validation set. I then plotted them against each other using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, also known as the ROC curve, in Figure 6. The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) was used to compare the models.Simply put, this metric represents the cost versus benefit of the model at every threshold, quantifying how good the model is at distinguishing between the classes. The best models will have curves that are close to the upper left corner and take up the most area in the plot.As you can see in Figure 6, Random Forest (in pink) is superior to the other models at basically every threshold, with Support Vector Machines (in orange) coming in second; the models had ROC AUC scores of 0.947 and 0.934 respectively. A score of 1 means it perfectly predicts the data, so these are very respectable results.Interestingly enough, random oversampling produced the best results for both of these models, which demonstrates that sometimes simplicity can outperform even the most sophisticated methods.Above is the distribution of the predicted probabilities outputted by the best Random Forest model. These numbers represent how likely it is that a particular county will have a high incidence of Lyme disease.The outputs are right skewed indicating that the model is predicting that most the counties have a low probability of having a high incidence. This is exactly what we want to see, especially since the classes are imbalanced.Right now, the default threshold for the model is 0.5, meaning that any county with a probability above 0.5 will be classified as high incidence and any county below 0.5 will be classified as low incidence. But what if this threshold is not the most optimal?That‚Äôs a major reason why I picked ROC AUC as my evaluation metric, as it is independent of threshold. This meant that I could then tune the threshold to optimize the model for the costs associated with making mistakes. I set aside an additional 20% of my data specifically for this purpose.So now we need to determine these costs. This is arguably the most important step in the process as we are going to place the model in the context of the real world, and not just in the vacuum of mathematics. I had to approximate the costs myself but ideally the stakeholder you are working with would be able to give you this information.As I mentioned earlier, the idea behind this model is to give the CDC a tool to determine which areas they need to target their efforts. If a county is classified as having high Lyme incidence, the CDC would take two specific actions:Okay, but what if the model predicts that a county is going to have a high incidence of Lyme disease but it actually doesn‚Äôt? This is called a false positive. One implication of this is that people would needlessly limit their time spent outdoors and possibly even decide not to travel to these areas. This decreased outdoor recreation and tourism could hurt local economies.To approximate this, I used the estimated total economic contributions that National Parks have on local communities, which is about $20.2 billion annually. Obviously, this doesn‚Äôt take into account state parks or any other services that would be affected, but it will work for now.I then tried to find research that quantified how consumer sales decreased during an established epidemic and there wasn‚Äôt alot available. Chou et al. found that the SARS epidemic in Asia cost countries between .2% and 1.56% in consumer related industries. SARS is a very different disease but it‚Äôs pretty much all there is at the moment to go off of. I chose to use 1% to roughly approximate the economic cost.Here is how I arrived at the cost per county of a false positive:Now what about the cost of a false negative? That would be where our model predicts that a county won‚Äôt have a problem with Lyme disease when it really does.This is obviously going to be way more expensive of a mistake. More people would needlessly get infected by Lyme disease due to lack of public awareness. And more people would suffer from chronic Lyme disease, as fewer doctors would be educated on early Lyme disease diagnosis.Zhang et al. found that the average early Lyme disease patient costs $1,310 annually, while a chronic Lyme disease patient costs $16,199. That‚Äôs over 12 times more expensive. This was done in 2000, so I had to account for an inflation factor of 1.41.Additionally, Aucott et al. approximated that 64% of new Lyme disease cases each year were early while 36% were chronic. As previously mentioned, there are about 300,000 of these new cases every year.Also, to simplify my calculation, I made the assumption that the CDC‚Äôs intervention would be completely effective, resulting in all the new Lyme disease cases being caught early.To find the cost of a false negative, I would just need to find the cost difference between when the CDC does not intervene and when it does intervene. Here were all my calculations:Finally, I calculated the ratio of the costs between the false negatives and positives:According to this, false negatives are almost 12 times more costly than false positives. I then plugged this value into my code and found the optimal threshold was 0.17. This means that any county above 0.17 will be classified as high incidence and any below will be low incidence. Refer back to Figure 7 to visualize where that cutoff would be.To prove the generalizability of my final model, I trained the model on all 80% of the previously used data (the 60% training set and the 20% threshold optimizing set) and then tested with the completely unseen 20% test set from the beginning.The results were even better than during training with a ROC AUC of 0.961.Additionally, the model had a great recall of about 0.949, meaning that it correctly classified about 95% of the high incidence counties. As seen in Figure 8, it only had 28 false negatives out of the 554 high incidence counties.This of course came at a cost to the precision which was 0.503. This means that only about 50% of the counties that the model predicted to be high incidence were actually high incidence. As seen in Figure 8, the false positives and true positives are roughly the same.Because false negatives were so much more costly than false positives, these results make complete sense. It was necessary for the model to be imprecise in order for it to correctly classify as many of the high incidence counties as it did.As a healthcare professional and as someone who personally knows four people affected by this disease, I was inspired that machine learning could be successfully implemented to aid in the fight against Lyme disease. This is yet another example of how data science can be used to make the world a better place and that is why I love it so much.Please check yourself for ticks when you spend time outdoors.

SQL Subqueries,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/sql-subqueries-85770fd52eb1,Randy Macaraeg,263,4,631,"The code I used for this blog can be found on my GitHub.Every time I learn something new about SQL I start to find that there are so many applications that I am unaware of. After learning the basic syntax of queries and a few basic tools, I moved onto subqueries in SQL.Subqueries (aka inner queries or nested queries) are useful tools when you‚Äôre performing multiple steps. It‚Äôs feels Inception-like, since you‚Äôre querying into queries.Subqueries can be used in several areas within the query, so today we‚Äôll cover using them in the most common areas: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.For these examples, we‚Äôll use the Chinook database which is also used in the SQL Basics blog.Let‚Äôs set up the database file, libraries, and functions:The database is loaded and now we‚Äôre ready to work with subqueries!Let‚Äôs start with an example query and break down what‚Äôs going on inside of it.First, the database runs the inner query, or the part within the parenthesis:This query goes into the genres table and pulls all rows whose name starts with ‚Äúr‚Äù.You might notice that this subquery can stand on its own, and this is very important: your subquery must run on its own. Once this runs, the output acts as the underlying table for the outer query.Also, subqueries should almost always have names, which are added after the parenthesis. In this section we named the subquery thisisaname.After the subquery/inner query runs, the outer query takes action:This query looks just like a regular basic query now! Using the new thisisaname table, the outer query now searches for all data where the genreid is above 6. The end query will output two rows: Reggae and R&B/Soul.Side-note: In the SELECT and WHERE statements, since this is only one table we‚Äôre working on we don‚Äôt necessarily need to add the thisisaname name to the query and it would still output the same thing. It‚Äôs still good form to use them, and this will make much more sense when using JOIN statements where you‚Äôd be interacting between multiple tables.Now that we have a better understanding of subqueries in the WHERE statement, let‚Äôs see what happens in the SELECT statement!Now let‚Äôs see what we can do when we put nested queries in the SELECT statement. Here is the example of what one might look like:Similar to the example above, we‚Äôll start with the inner query and move outward.This subquery will take a full count of all rows in the tracks dataset, which is a total of 3503 rows.The COUNT functions in the outer query act differently from the one in the subquery. The COUNT in the outer query is counting the frequency of each individual composer using the GROUP BY clause. It also collects only the rows whose counts are above 30 and ignores any rows with missing composer names.The final output will give four rows with the composer name, the total count of each individual composer, and the frequency of each individual composer in comparison to the total table count of 3503.Hopefully I explained this well and that it makes sense. Lastly, let‚Äôs see a subquery in the WHERE statement!Like the last examples, let‚Äôs start with our full query:And as always, we start with the inner query:This query orders all of the hire dates in ascending order (by default) and takes the earliest 5 hire dates. Now, let‚Äôs bring it back to the original query!The outer query now searches all the rows in the employees table and returns only the rows whose hire date is within the 5 hire dates found in the subquery. This returns 6 employees, some of the earliest in the company!I do appreciate you sticking around till the end and I hope you found some of this useful. Stay tuned for another SQL blog post coming soon!",25/07/2019,2,9,9,0,1050,740,2,0,0,4,613
Linear Regression in Python,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-on-housing-dataset-a57ef8bf2e60,Kushaal Rao,90,5,700,"Linear regression is arguably one of the most important and most used models in data science. In this blog post, I will walk you through the process of creating a linear regression model and show you some cool data visualization tricks.We will be using the Ames Housing dataset, which is an expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. The dataset has approximately 1,700 rows and 81 columns, and the goal is to predict the selling price in the market.Just like any other project, the first step is to import all the libraries. You can import more libraries as you figure out all the tools you will need to build your model.Now, before we process or change the data, let‚Äôs just get an idea of what we are dealing with.The short description of the data set shows us that it contains various data types and null values. It‚Äôs important to remember this as we process the data and build our model.Datasets in the real world are never perfect. There will always be missing values and outliers that skew the dataset, affecting the accuracy of our predictive model. That‚Äôs why it is always a good idea to clean up the data before you start building your model.Earlier, I had mentioned that this particular dataset had 1,700 rows and 81 columns. If a value is missing in a particular column, it would be unwise to delete that whole row because we would be losing a datapoint in every other column as well. There are two ways to solve this issue:I opted for the second method, so I left the null values as they were in my dataset.There are multiple ways to calculate outliers‚Äî z-score, inter-quartile range (IQR), and the Tukey method are just a few methods out there. I chose to use the IQR. For all intents and purposes, I am assuming that you are familiar with the concepts of IQR, so I will only go over how to code it in Python. If you feel like you could use a short overview, this blog post does a pretty solid job of explaining the key ideas behind inter-quartile range.In order to calculate the first and third quartile, I used the describe() function on the dataset.The describe() function yields a neat and concise data frame with important statistics from each numerical column of the original dataset. As you can see in the image above, I now have access to the mean, standard deviation, and percentile values with just one line of code!Now, I store each statistic for every column in a data series. This allows me to access the percentile values in all the columns iteratively.Now let‚Äôs dive into the deep end. I‚Äôll first explain at a high level how I calculated the IQR before I dump my code onto here.Now that we have processed our data, it is time to create our model, but we have 80 potential independent variables. How do we determine which one has the strongest correlation with the target variable, SalePrice?I created a correlation matrix for every single variable with every other variable in the dataset.The correlation matrix was far too big to capture in one screenshot, so this zoomed out, blurry version will have to suffice‚Äî you get the gist though. From the correlation matrix, I discovered that the variables ‚ÄòOverallQual‚Äô and ‚ÄòGrLivArea‚Äô have the highest correlation with SalePrice.Just to do double check, I plotted a scatterplot of the two variables.There is clearly a linear relationship in both cases, so we are good to go!To create the model, set X and y to their respective columns. Using the train_test_split() function, split the data set into a training and testing dataset for the model. The parameter test_size within the function indicates what percentage of the dataset should be reserved for testing. The standard is 30%Linear regression makes the most sense visually‚Äî when you can actually see the line of best fit. Here is the code I used to plot the graph below, and below the graph you will find a model summary with all the important statistics.I hope that this walk through was helpful!

Millennials‚Äô Favorite Fruit: Forecasting Avocado Prices with ARIMA Models,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/millennials-favorite-fruit-forecasting-avocado-prices-with-arima-models-5b46e4e0e914,Sean Holland,20,8,1626,"If you know the first thing about finance, you know that the single obstacle standing between Millenials and the white picket fence is avocado toast. If the kids of the Information Age would just get off their butts, walk away from the brunch table, and leave their smashed avocado and poached egg on whole grain behind then maybe they could afford their dream two-bedroom in Ames, Iowa. Obviously.In solidarity with Millenials‚Äô avocado toast-induced financial woes, I wanted to take a deeper look at America‚Äôs favorite fruit. Yes, the avocado is a fruit ‚Äî a berry even. My research also suggests that the avocado is not, in fact, a conspiracy by toast manufacturers to sell more toast.So, in this post, I will be analyzing data from the Hass Avocado Board (HAB) ‚Äî a trade organization that provides industry professionals with research and data on avocado prices around the world. If you are looking to get a taste of avocado-related research, you can find the data here.DataThe HAB dataset is comprised of weekly time series data spanning 168 weeks from January 4, 2015, to March 25, 2018. For this period, the dataset provides average price and total volume data for conventional and organic avocados in 54 regions of the United States, totaling over 18,000 observations.So let‚Äôs get into it ‚Äî what do our avocados look like?The eye test tells us that organic avocado prices are both higher on average and more volatile than conventional avocados. Digging into the numbers, conventional avocados cost on average $1.16 across all regions with a standard deviation of $0.26. Meanwhile, organic avocados cost on $1.65 on average with a standard deviation of $0.36.Looking at avocados sold, however, reveals that organic avocados only constitute about 3 percent of all avocados sold in the US over this period. Between January 2015 and March 2018, consumers bought over 33 million conventional avocados and under one million organic avocados.We know that conventional avocados are more expensive on average and vastly outpace organic avocados in terms of sales. So, this raises the question ‚Äî what is the nature of the relationship between price and volume sold?For the 168 weeks studied, conventional avocados demonstrated a moderate negative correlation between average prices and units sold. Nothing out of the ordinary here, rather basic principles of economics ‚Äî quantity demanded increases as price decreases.Organic avocados tell a different story. There is no statistically significant relationship between the price tag and units sold for organic avocados. Demand is flat, meaning that regardless of price, consumers are unlikely to significantly change the quantity they demand. Context is important in understanding this relationship.Research has shown that consumers with higher incomes, young children, and/or college degrees are more likely to be ‚Äúdevoted‚Äù organic consumers than their peers. In this context, ‚Äúdevoted‚Äù indicates that the consumer spends a higher-than-average portion of their household income on organic fruits and vegetables. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that regular organic avocado consumers belong to a non-typical segment of the population. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have the resources to find the causal factors behind this flat relationship, but I can certainly (and will gladly) venture a guess. Consumers who regularly buy organic goods are (probably) more likely to do so out of some principle. Perhaps the consumer believes organic foods to be healthier or more ethical than non-organic foods. Therefore, the organic consumer would not likely consume non-organic foods due to simply shifts in organic food prices, giving us the flat demand curve for organic avocados.Next, I wanted to take a quick look at prices and volume by region. Northeasterners (my people) and Washingtonians (also my people) pay amongst the highest rates for organic and conventional avocados in the country. Northeasterners pay $1.34 on average for conventional and $1.86 for organic avocados. Meanwhile, the national average for avocado prices stands at $1.09 for conventional and $1.55 for organic.In terms of volume, Westerners consume the most avocados, both conventional and organic, per week on average. Westerners consumed over 6,180,000 conventional and 220,000 organic avocados per week. Compared to national averages, Westerners consume about 18 percent of all conventional and 23% of all organic avocados sold in the US.That‚Äôs a lot of avocado toast.ForecastsI think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that the ship has sailed for Millenials in terms of being able to afford that two-bedroom I mentioned earlier. I mean Americans are spending around $7,000,000 a week on avocados so all hopes of the white picket fence should be dashed for Millenials.Thankfully, according to the Pew Research Center, I belong to the Gen Z cohort. Of course, this means that I need to have some idea of how the avocado economy is going to affect my chances at picket-fence related dreams.To do so, I turned to ARIMA forecasting. Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average models are a general class of models that allow for forecasting models to be made stationary through ‚Äúdifferencing.‚Äù Stationarity is an important condition in forecasting, as nonstationarity can undermine the reliability of traditional confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and forecasts.ARIMA models can be broken down into three components, AR, I, and MA. First, the AR component describes a linear multiple regression with a given number of previous values of Y as the predictors for Y(t). The I component describes the order of differencing necessary to make the model stationary. The MA component is similar to the AR component in that it introduces a lagged value into the model. However, the lagged value is the previous error terms, not the previous values.Thankfully for an ARIMA novice such as myself, Rob Hyndman‚Äôs ‚ÄúForecast‚Äù package in R comes equipped with the auto.arima function. Auto.arima tests several ARIMA models and selects the best one based on Akaike Information Criteria, providing an excellent starting point from which to select a final model.Using Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, which tests for unit roots that can bias the OLS estimators, I concluded that one order of differencing was necessary for each of my four models ‚Äî conventional prices, conventional volume, organic prices, and organic volume. Additionally, I elected to use seasonal ARIMA models, which contain another set of AR, I, and MA parameters for a given period (in this case 52 weeks or one year).So, what can we learn from our models? Well, first of all, our average price models seem to show us that avocado prices reach their peak each year in the Autumn. In October 2017, conventional avocados peaked at $1.65 and our model forecasts that Autumn spikes will continue to occur through 2018 and 2019. However, the model predicts that conventional avocado prices will trend downwards over the following two years. Between 2015 and 2018, the average conventional avocado price was $1.09. Between 2018 and 2020, the forecasted average price is $1.01, a decrease of about 7 percent.In stark contrast, the model forecasts that organic avocado prices will experience moderate growth, bolstered by less volatility. The forecasted average price between 2018 and 2020 is $1.84, compared to $1.55 between 2015 and 2018. The model certainly demonstrated a moderate upward trend for organic avocado prices.However, the growth in average prices is also due in part to decreased volatility, with the standard deviation of prices down to $0.16 for the forecasted period from the $0.36 standard deviation experienced between 2015 and 2018.Both conventional and organic avocados are forecasted to experience strong growth in terms of units sold over the 2018‚Äì2020 period. Conventional avocado production is forecasted to grow over 40 percent from 33.7 million to 47.6 million avocados sold each week on average.Organic avocados are forecasted to experience even more meteoric growth. A consistent growth trend between 2015 and 2018 is predicted to continue through 2019 with a whopping 74 percent growth between 2018 and 2020. Between 2015 and 2018, suppliers sold about 970,000 organic avocados weekly. Between 2018 and 2020, the number is forecasted to jump to 1.68 million organic avocados.DiscussionI think these models are really exciting. First, in terms of pattern recognition, it is interesting to see the models picking up on seasonal trends. The price models captured the Autumn price hikes and the volume models captured the spikes that occur in avocado volume each February.Additionally, the diagnostics look pretty good. Mean Absolute Percentage Error, or MAPE, measures the error between the forecast and observed values, so a lower value indicates a better fitting model. The highest MAPE amongst the four models is for the organic volume model, at around 6 percent, indicating the model is about 94 percent accurate. I am very happy with this level of fit and I am confident in all of the models. At least, I am as confident as an forecasting newbie could be.If I had to editorialize (which I will gladly do) I would say that the growth forecast for organic avocado volume is somewhat bullish. I am not sure how realistic 74 percent growth is over only two years, but testing several models yielded similar results.Alternatively, I think that the conventional avocado price model is somewhat bearish. With the Autumn price hike increasing each year since 2015, I was surprised that the model forecasted overall price decreases. However, if it ends up being the case through 2020, you will not see me complaining at brunch.ConclusionSo there it is folks ‚Äî my little introduction to ARIMA forecasting and with a worthy test subject like avocados. And although conventional avocado prices might be decreasing, it looks like the increased volume of avocados sold is going to keep yet another generation from attaining suburban, property-owning paradise.I hope you enjoyed my foray into forecasting and I hope to return to this subject soon with more improved ARIMA models and other more complex models. And hey, maybe invest in organic avocado growers ‚Äî you just might see a 74 percent return.Well, probably not.",25/07/2019,0,0,9,5,1008,552,11,0,0,10,52
Relative vs Absolute: How to Do Compositional Data Analyses. Part ‚Äî 2,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/relative-vs-absolute-how-to-do-compositional-data-analyses-part-2-f554eb9b26e,Krishna Yerramsetty,60,14,2776,"This is a continuation of my earlier post on compositional data analyses where I showed the pitfalls of treating compositional data as absolute data instead of relative data. In this post, I will summarize the techniques we can use to correctly analyze compositional data with specific examples demonstrated using RNA-Seq data.Two main strategies exist for treating Compositional Data and specifically NGS data: 1. Normalization to get back the absolute counts2. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) methods that transform the data using within sample references (Ex: ALR, CLR)This is the most widely used technique in NGS data pre-processing when comparing across samples is desired. The relative read counts are ‚Äònormalized‚Äô to the total read depth to ‚Äòrecover‚Äô the absolute counts. This, however, does not recover the absolute counts when the total absolute amounts of RNA or cells or the amount of relevant biological material significantly changes across samples. This more often leads to a false sense of security for the analyst and leads to treating these ‚Äònormalized‚Äô samples as absolute counts. This can result in erroneous conclusions when comparing across samples. Let‚Äôs prove that to ourselves using simulated data.Here, I simulated data for 100 genes, where a. 5 genes have the true log fold change of 1 between control and experimental conditions (approximates tolerance or no growth under selection), b. 2 genes have the same true log fold change of > 1 in the experimental conditions (resistant and exhibit growth under selection), and c. 2 genes have the same true log fold change of < 1 in the experimental conditions (not resistant or tolerant), I simulated 5 different cases where different proportions of the remaining 91 genes are changed. Of the genes that change, ~90% are depleted, and ~10% are enriched in each case.The depletion/enrichment of the other genes affects the relative count values and the read-depth normalized counts even though the total read depth is fixed at 200K reads2. Correlation Between Genes: To see how things compare between relative counts and absolute counts., I calculated the correlation for the non-constant genes across all the 5 samples (each with either 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.9 fractions of changed genes). I used both the true counts and relative counts using Polyester simulated count data at 200K read depth.As we can see from the figure above, some of the correlation coefficients calculated using the RDN counts, are significantly different from the true correlation coefficients, with a negative bias.The 2 examples above show the pitfalls of using RDN counts to estimate the differential expression or correlation between genes. Instead of using RDN counts, one should always use spike-in controls when trying to recover absolute counts from relative compositional data. We will show that nextTo truly correct for the change in the absolute counts, we need spike-in controls or genes that we add into all our samples at the same abundance (amount) just before the sequencing step. Doing this will normalize all the samples to the same total abundance scale and makes the comparisons correct. This only works when the data are closed due to sequencing (because we are adding the spike-ins just before sequencing), and will not help if the constraint is biological or happens upstream of the sequencing step. In that case, we need to add in the spike-ins before this constraining step, but it is not always possible to do so due to physical and biological limitations of adding the spike-ins. Let‚Äôs see how this works using our data. In our data, we have 92 different controls or spiked-in genes that have the true absolute abundance. Let‚Äôs use these to ‚Äònormalize‚Äô the data and therefore bring all samples to the same absolute count scale.2. Correlation Between Genes: Looking at correlations between genes, we see that the coefficients calculated using the spike-in normalized counts can recover the true coefficients. Fig 4 below:So, it seems like we found the solution to our problem. All we have to do is add some controls and we are good! Not so fast, unfortunately. In this simulated case, the source of closure for the compositional data is sequencing and we were able to add some controls right before we simulated the sequencing data. In real-life data generation process, the sources of closure can occur anywhere in the usually complicated workflow of extracting DNA/RNA. Also, the biological system itself could be inherently compositional (For example the capacity for a cell to produce RNA is limited), in which case no spike-ins introduced outside the cell can recover the true absolute counts.An alternative to spike-in normalization is using CoDA methods that typically transform the count data with respect to an in-sample reference. Additive Log-Transformation (ALR) and Centered Log-Transformation (CLR) are examples of some commonly used CoDA transformations. These methods are first proposed by John Aitchison originally in 1986. The core idea being that the log-ratio transformations of the components relative to another reference component can be treated as any other unconstrained data. This transforms the data from the original simplex space (as in our ternary diagram in the first part) to the Euclidean space. This allows us to use all classical analyses techniques on these data.A cautionary note: These techniques do not claim to open the data as do the ‚Äònormalization‚Äô methods from the previous section. These techniques are also applicable to all data, whether they are relative or absolute. Another point to note is normalizing using spike-ins is the same as using the Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) transformation. The benefit of using the general ALR transformation is that it is applicable even when we do not have spike-ins that have constant abundance across samples. The disadvantage with the general ALR transformation is we need to choose the reference properly to make sense of the data and answer the relevant questions. Lets now look at the CoDA methods in more detail using the same data set that we used as before.1.Differential Expression or Abundance: There are many methods to find changes in compositional data before and after treatment. Many of these methods surprisingly come from the Microbiome literature, whereas the gene expression literature mostly relies on traditional methods like DESeq2 and EdgeR, which do not explicitly take into account the compositional nature of the data. DESeq2 and EdgeR implicitly assume that the absolute abundances do not change due to the treatment. This is equivalent to using the Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) transformation from the CoDA methods. This transformation uses the geometric mean of the genes or components as the reference, and therefore all results have to be interpreted with respect to the geometric mean. At this stage, it is tempting to translate this assumption to mean that the geometric mean of the genes does not change between control and treatment. Maybe the geometric mean changes, maybe it does not, there is no way to know for sure without orthogonal information beyond the relative counts from sequencing. Most users of DESeq2 and other Differential Expression tools fall for this trap and conclude any significant changes called by the algorithms to mean significant changes in the absolute counts. Instead, these are just significant changes with respect to the geometric mean of all components.There are emerging methods to apply statistical rigor to DA in compositional data. The most popular methods are ALDEx2 and ANCOM. The main philosophy of these methods is to rely on log-ratio tests of transformed relative data with respect to a reference component and to carefully interpret these results. The main issue with these methods is that the results can only be interpreted with respect to the chosen reference, and no guidance is provided on how to choose the reference. The main idea of DR is to choose some random reference component to calculate the log ratios for all components in both treatment and control. In the next step, these components are ranked in the order of their the difference Œî(log-ratio) between treatment and control conditions. This rank-order of Œî(log-ratio) values calculated using the known relative counts should be identical to the rank of the Œî(log-ratio) values calculated using the unknown true absolute counts. For example, I show below the Œî(log-ratio) values calculated using the relative counts vs. Œî(log-ratio) values calculated using absolute counts, for the case where 90% of the genes are differentially expressed:As you can see, the magnitude of the Œî(log-ratio) values are different depending on whether we use the relative or absolute counts, but the rankings of Œî(log-ratio) values stay the same. This does not mean that the top-ranking genes have higher counts in treatment vs control, and the low-ranking genes have lower counts. It could so happen, that the top-ranking genes have depleted absolute counts in the treatment conditions compared to the control condition, but the lower-ranked genes have even worse depletion in the treatment condition. In short, we cannot say anything about the changes in absolute reads between treatment and condition.I will now choose the top-ranking gene as my reference and again calculate the Œî(log-ratio) values using this new reference.From this plot, we can use an arbitrary cut-off of 0.5 and choose any genes beyond this as our potential DA genes to test further. Of course, if we want more genes to test, we can relax the cut-off.Another recommendation to get around choosing reference is to have some sort of positive or negative controls in the population. Suppose, we know a gene that will increase in absolute abundance in the treatment condition, then we can use this gene as the natural reference for calculating log-ratios and rank-order the Œî(log-ratio) values. Any log-ratio greater than 1 implies that the gene is better than the positive control, and log-ratio less than 1 implies worse than the positive control. Even better, is to have 2 controls to bound the effect size, and interpret the log-ratios with reference to both of these genes.In my simulation, I only have one sample per replicate, and therefore could not do any statistical analyses. In a future post, I will generate multiple replicates per condition and play with ALDEx2, ANCOM, and DR algorithms to test their sensitivity and specificity.2. Correlation Between Genes: As shown in part 1 of this series, correlation is not sub-compositionally coherent and therefore does not follow one of the principles of CoDA. Briefly, the correlation coefficient between any two genes depends on the other components or genes present in the data. Aitchison first proposed using the variance of log-ratio transformed values (VLR) to estimate the dependency of 2 variables. For example, to calculate the dependency between features or genes, g, and h, across n samples, we would use:VLR is sub-compositionally coherent and therefore doesn‚Äôt lead to spurious correlations. The main issue with using VLR is that even though it equates to 0 when genes g and h are perfectly correlated, it doesn‚Äôt have an upper limit when the genes are perfectly independent. And that makes it difficult to compare VLR for one gene pair against VLR for another gene pair because of this scaling issue. Several methods/metrics are proposed based on VLR to estimate the dependencies between compositions, the most notable being SparCC, SPIEC-EASI, and proportionality. In this blog, I only review proportionality in some detail. All these methods attempt to use VLR to derive metrics that are analogous to correlation coefficients and therefore can be compared across different pairs of components.Three proportionality based metrics are proposed in the R package propr based on work by Lovell et. al. and Quinn et. al. These metrics are calculated on log-transformed data. For definitions see the propr package. Ai below refers to the log-transformed values for a gene or component ‚Äòi‚Äô in the data. Ai could be absolute or relative counts and the definitions still apply.The closest metric to traditional correlation coefficient is rho which ranges from -1 to 1. phi is unbounded and can vary from 0 to Inf, and phis is a symmetric variant of phi and is a monotonic function of rho. I will focus on rho in the rest of the blog.a. Using Absolute Counts: We can recover the absolute counts from relative counts if we have a spike-in control. Since we already have spike-in data available to us, I will calculate the rho values using the spike-in transformed data, i.e. A¬π = log(TPM_counts¬π/Spike_TPM_counts) for gene 1 using spike_TPM_counts as the normalization counts. This will recover the original absolute counts. Now, we can calculate the rho values using the equation above. I plot the correlation between absolute counts and the rho values below:As can be seen from this plot, using proportionality we can capture most of the original correlations between the true absolute counts. Of course, this is a contrived example, where we have a good spike-in available to retrieve the absolute counts. Even with this contrived example, we still see some differences between the true correlations and the proportionality values calculated using the spike-in normalized counts. This is due to the way the proportionality based metrics are calculated which makes them extremely sensitive to the estimates of the variances of the log-transformed values. Here we only have 5 samples to calculate the variances and in most cases, the first 3 samples have the same values. This I suspect leads to the formulae to calculate the metrics to break down. Have to grok on this a little bit more. The evidence for this hypothesis is that, if we only look for components that have distinct values in at least 4 different samples, then the correlation values and the proportionality metrics match pretty well as can be seen below:In general, rho and other proportionality based measures have good precision and poor recall, and having more samples gives better estimates for the variances and therefore for the rho values. Also, boot-strapping is generally used to establish a cut-off for calling relationships significant. For example, in the plot above, the cut-off for significant ‚Äòrho‚Äô values could be 0.75.b. Using Relative Counts: The world is unfairly complex, and we don‚Äôt usually have a nice spike-in lying around for us to use, unfortunately üò¢ . So we have to instead use relative data, or more specifically, the additive log-transformed (ALR) relative data. Or we can use centered log-transformation (CLR) if we are confident that the geometric mean of the counts does not change across samples (which we know does not hold for our simulated data here). In essence, the best we can do in such cases is to calculate the relationships between relative data. So, let‚Äôs compare the rho values for relative data (with respect to a chosen reference gene) against the correlations between true absolute counts. The plots below show this for the correlation between relative counts calculated using 2 randomly chosen reference genes:As is evident from the plots above, the choice of the reference gene makes a huge difference in what gene pairs we call proportional. There is no way we can figure out before-hand how to choose a cut-off on the proportionality values to ensure a good balance between precision and recall. VLR as proposed by Aitchison, whose formula is shown earlier in this post, doesn‚Äôt suffer from this because the reference is canceled out when we take the log ratios of the 2 genes in a gene-pair, but we can‚Äôt use VLR to compare across gene pairs because it doesn‚Äôt have an interpretable scale. So, we are back to square one, unfortunately. This is explained mathematically by Erb and Notredame. An alternative could be to not bother about proportionalities by themselves but instead calculate differential proportionalities across conditions. To do this, we only need to compare gene-pairs across conditions and VLR is sufficient for it and we don‚Äôt have to worry about scaling. This post is already too long and this may be a discussion for another post. Besides, now that I have seen the problems with proportionality-based metrics, other methods like SparCC seem like a good alternative to at least try. Again, maybe for another post. Overall, proportionality-based metrics offer an interesting alternative to correlation-based metrics for compositional data, but interpreting these data in the absence of good spike-in control is tricky.In conclusion, there is no magic pill to recover the absolute counts from relative data in the absence of a spike-in control. However, learning about the CoDA methods helped me better appreciate the nuances involved in interpreting compositional data. I think this is analogous to Bayesian statistics vs Frequentist Statistics, where the former forces the practitioner to lay-out all the assumptions in the form of a prior. In the case of CoDA methods, choosing the reference forces the user to be wary of wrongful interpretation of the data.You can find all code and data for this post and the previous post in the series here: https://github.com/kimoyerr/CODA",25/07/2019,1,0,8,2,777,468,11,3,0,23,28
Street Lanes Finder - Detecting Street Lanes for Self-Driving Cars üöó,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/street-lanes-finder-detecting-street-lanes-for-self-driving-cars-fe069ec5a22d,Greg Surma,1800,5,531,"In today‚Äôs article, we are going to use basic Computer Vision techniques to approach the street lanes detection problem which is crucial for self-driving cars. By the end of this article, you will be able to perform real-time lane detection with Python and OpenCV.You can find the full codebase for this project on GitHub and I encourage you to check it and follow along.github.comLet‚Äôs start with defining our problem.Given an image of the road, we would like to detect street lanes on it.In order to do it, let‚Äôs provide an image path and load it with OpenCV, then let‚Äôs invoke find_street_lanes pipeline with it.And this is how our find_street_lanes pipeline looks likeThe first step of our pipeline is an image conversion from color to grayscale. We do it because in our case color values don‚Äôt hold any valuable information so to make further processing simpler and faster, we convert from three channels to one.Then, to make our image smoother and less noisy, we apply a gentle Gaussian Blur.Gaussian Blur works by calculating every pixel‚Äôs value as a weighted average of the surrounding pixels.This is where the fun part begins. Now having a smooth grayscale image, we need to detect edges within it.FYI, it‚Äôs called ‚Äòcanny‚Äô because it was invented by John Canny.Without going into too many details, the core part of the canny edge detector is based on scanning the image and calculating derivatives (gradients) of neighboring pixel values. The higher the gradient, the more likely it is an edge.Now, having our edges detected, we can clearly see where our street lanes are, but besides that, we can also see other edges that are redundant. In order to get rid of them, we should mask our image to a specific region that‚Äôs called a Region of Interest (ROI). Defining proper ROI is highly dependant on the camera calibration and its frame i.e what part of the road is visible.This the defined mask where the white color shows ROIand this is canny image with a masked region of interest.Now we have well defined lines that show where our street lanes are located. However, presenting them on the screen wouldn‚Äôt look appealing as they are noisy andflickery. In order to visualize them as single lines, we need to perform hough lines transformation.3. Then we need to average lines and derive single left and right line.4. Ultimately, we can draw our final lines.Finally, we need to overlay our input image with derived lines.Having a pipeline that can detect lines for a single frame, we can run it real-time on a video stream performing detections on every frame.In this project, we‚Äôve learned how to use basic Computer Vision techniques for real-life problems. Even though our results look very promising, street lanes detector is far from perfection and it might fail in some cases. That is why in the next part we are going to use Deep Learning approach (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) to achieve better accuracy and more reliable detector.

The Complete Guide to Decision Trees,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-guide-to-decision-trees-17a874301448,Marco Peixeiro,3300,9,1550,"Tree-based methods can be used for regression or classification. They involve segmenting the prediction space into a number of simple regions. The set of splitting rules can be summarized in a tree, hence the name decision tree methods.A single decision tree is often not as performant as linear regression, logistic regression, LDA, etc. However, by introducing bagging, random forests, and boosting, it can result in dramatic improvements in prediction accuracy at the expense of some loss in interpretation.In this post, we introduce everything you need to know about decision trees, bagging, random forests, and boosting. It will be a long read, but it will be worth it!For hands-on video tutorials on machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, checkout my YouTube channel.Before getting to the theory, we need some basic terminology.Trees are drawn upside down. The final regions are termed leaves. The points inside the tree where a split occurs is an interval node. Finally, segments that connect nodes are branches.To create a regression tree:Each region is split to minimize the RSS. To do so, it takes a top-down greedy approach also called recursive binary splitting.Why top-down?Because all observations are in a single region before the first split.Why a greedy approach?Because the best split occurs at a particular step, rather than looking ahead and making a split that will result in a better prediction in a future step.Mathematically, we define the pair of half-planes as:and we seek j and s to minimize:However, this may lead to overfitting. Pruning the tree will result in a smaller subtree that we can validate with cross-validation.A classification tree is very similar to a regression tree. However, we cannot use the mean value of the response, so we now predict the most commonly occurring class in a region. Of course, RSS cannot be used as a criterion. Instead, each split is done to minimize the classification error rate.The classification error rate is simply the fraction of training observations in a region that do not belong to the most common class.Unfortunately, this is not sensitive enough for tree-growing. In practice, two other methods are used.There is the Gini index:This is a measure of total variance across all classes. As you can see, the Gini index will be small if the proportion is close to 0 or 1, so it is a good measure of node purity.A similar rationale is applied to the other method called cross-entropy:Now that we have seen how a basic decision tree works, let‚Äôs see how we can improve its performance!We know that bootstrap can compute the standard deviation of any quantity of interest. For decision trees, the variance is very high. Therefore, with bootstrap aggregation or bagging, we can reduce the variance and increase the performance of a decision tree.Bagging involves repeatedly taking samples from a dataset. This generates B different bootstrap training sets. Then, we train on all bootstrapped training sets to get a prediction for each set, and we average the predictions.Mathematically, the average prediction is:Applying this to decision trees, it means that that we can construct a high number of trees which will have high variance and low bias. Then, we can average their predictions to reduce the variance to improve the performance of the decision trees.Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a small tweak that decorrelates the trees.Like in bagging, multiple decision trees are built. However, at each split, a random sample of m predictors is chosen from all p predictors. The split is allowed to use only one of the m predictors, and typically:In other words, at each split, the algorithm is not allowed to consider a majority of the available predictors!Why?Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the dataset, along with other moderately strong predictors. Then, in the collection of bagged trees, they will all use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the bagged trees will be very similar, and averaging their predictions will not reduce variance, since the predictions would be highly correlated.Random forests overcome this problem by forcing each split to only consider a subset of predictors which effectively decorrelates the trees.Of course, if m is equal to p, then it is just like bagging. Usually, the square root of p gives the best results as shown below.Boosting works in a similar way to bagging, but the trees are grown sequentially: each tree uses information from the previously grown trees.This means that the algorithm learns slowly. Each tree is fit to the residuals from the model rather than to the target variable. Hence, each tree is small and will slowly improve predictions in areas where it does not perform well.There are three tuning parameters in boosting:1. number of tree (B): unlike bagging and random forests, boosting can overfit if B is too large. Use cross-validation to choose the right amount of trees.2. shrinkage parameter (alpha): a small positive number that controls the learning rate of boosting. It is typically set to 0.01 or 0.001.3. number of splits in each tree (d): it controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Usually, a single split (d = 1) works well. It is also called the interaction depth.As you can see above, an interaction depth of 1 seems to give the best results.Now, let‚Äôs apply what we have learned to predict breast cancer. Many datasets about breast cancer contain information about the tumor. However, I was lucky to find a dataset that contains routine blood tests information of patients with and without breast cancer. Potentially, if we can accurately predict if a patient has cancer, that patient could receive very early treatments, even before a tumor is noticeable!Of course, the dataset and full notebook are available here, and I strongly suggest that you code along.Before starting our work on Jupyter, we can gain information about the dataset here.First, you notice that the dataset is very small, with only 116 instances. This poses several challenges, because the decision trees might overfit the data, or our predictive model might not be the best, due to the lack of other observations. Yet, it is a good proof-of-concept that might demonstrate a real potential of predicting breast cancer from a simple blood test.The dataset contains only the following ten attributes:1. Age: age of the patient (years)2. BMI: body mass index (kg/m¬≤)3. Glucose: glucose concentration in blood (mg/dL)4. Insulin: insulin concentration in blood (microU/mL)5. HOMA: Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (glucose multiplied by insulin)6. Leptin: concentration of leptin ‚Äî the hormone of energy expenditure (ng/mL)7. Adiponectin: concentration of adiponectin ‚Äî a protein regulating glucose levels (micro g/mL)8. Resistin: concentration of resistin ‚Äî a protein secreted by adipose tissue (ng/mL)9. MCP.1: concentration of MCP-1 ‚Äî a protein that recruits monocytes to the sites of inflammation due to tissue injury or inflammation (pg/dL)10. Classification: Healthy controls (1) or patient (2)Now that we know what we will be working with, we can start by importing our usual libraries:Then, define the path to the dataset and let‚Äôs preview it:Great! Now, because this is a classification problem, let‚Äôs see if the classes are balanced:The result should be:As you can see, there is almost the same number of patients and healthy controls.Now, it would be interesting to see the distribution and density of each feature for healthy people and patients. To do so, a violin plot is ideal. It shows both the density and distribution of a feature in a single plot. Let‚Äôs have nine violin plots: one for each feature:Take time to review all the plots and try to find some differences between healthy controls and patients.Finally, let‚Äôs check if we have missing values:You should see that none of the columns have missing values! We are now ready to start modelling!First, we need to encode the classes to 0 and 1:Now, 0 represents a healthy control, and 1 represents a patient.Then, we split the dataset into a training and test set:Before writing our models, we need to define the appropriate error metric. In this case, since it is a classification problem, we could use a confusion matrix and use the classification error. Let‚Äôs write a helper function to plot the confusion matrix:Awesome! Now, let‚Äôs implement a decision tree.Using scikit-learn, a decision tree is implemented very easily:You should get the following confusion matrix:As you can see, it misclassified three instances. Therefore, let‚Äôs see if bagging, boosting or random forest can improve the performance of the tree.To implement a decision tree with bagging, we write the following:And you get the following confusion matrix:Amazing! The model classified correctly all instances in the test set! For the sake of getting more practice, let‚Äôs also implement a random forest classifier and use boosting.Here, for the random forest classifier, we specify the number of trees we want. Let‚Äôs go with 100:And you get this confusion matrix:Here, although only one instance was misclassified, the model in fact said that a patient was healthy, when in fact the person had cancer! This is a very undesirable situation.Finally, for boosting:And we get the following:Again, only one instance was misclassified.This article covered a lot! You learned the underlying theory of tree-based methods, you learned how we can improve their performance and we implemented each algorithm in a project setting.I hope you found this article useful and that you will use it in a future project.",25/07/2019,2,0,13,27,950,575,29,1,0,6,90
Trees in data science,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/trees-in-data-science-dcd9830cbfcf,Antony Paulson Chazhoor,113,4,536,"One of the most easy to interpret models in machine learning are CART‚Äôs(Classification and Regression Trees) known popularly as decision trees. In this post I wish to give an overview of Decision Trees, some primary concepts surrounding them and finally Random Forests. The contents are as followsLets Go!In the machine learning universe trees are actually upside down versions of real trees. Suppose we have a dataset consisting of our features ‚ÄòX‚Äô and a target ‚ÄòY‚Äô. What a decision tree does is that it finds patterns within X and splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on these patterns.Visualize these splits in the slightly simplified image above. ‚ÄòY‚Äô here is whether or not a job offer is to be accepted. The ‚ÄòX‚Äô contains features like ‚Äúcommute_time‚Äù, ‚Äúsalary‚Äù, ‚Äúfree_coffee‚Äù.Based on patterns in ‚ÄòX‚Äô the tree is split into branches until it reaches a point where it arrives at a pure answer to ‚ÄòY‚Äô. In our scenario, job offers which are accepted have to provide a salary > 50k, commute time < 1hr and free coffee. In this manner the tree reaches the last leaf which is a pure decision about ‚ÄòY‚Äô.Decision trees conduct splitting based on the purity of the node. This purity is measured based on the distribution of ‚ÄòY‚Äô. If our ‚ÄòY‚Äô is continuous our problem is a regression problem and the nodes are split based on MSE(Mean Squared Error). If ‚ÄòY‚Äô is discrete, our model is dealing with a classification problem and a different measure of purity is required.A widely used metric to measure in classification cases is Gini Impurity. The formula for Gini impurity is given as follows:While deciding which split to make at a given node, it picks the split that maximizes the drop in Gini impurity from the parent node to the child node.To understand bootstrapping and bagging, the first step would be to understand why they are needed in the first place. It is basically trying to emulate the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù principle where in the aggregated result of multiple models is better than the results of a single model. The following image by Lorna Yen gives a great idea about boot strapping.Bootstrapping as shown above is just the random sampling of data with replacement. Bagging is just a process of building decision trees on each of these samples and getting an aggregate prediction. So to summarize Bagging involves the following steps:Bagging is therefore also called Bootstrapped Aggregating.A closer look at the below image gives a basic intuition on random forests.A basic hurdle in bagging is that the individual decision trees are highly correlated as the same features are used in all trees. So the predictions of our models suffer from the issue of variance. To know more on variance or bias you can read this link. Decorrelating our models is a solution and is exactly what Random Forests do.Random forests follow similar steps in bagging except that they use at each split in the learning process, a random subset of the features. This mitigates the variance problem in bagging and generally produces much better results. This efficient and simple methodology has made Random forests a widely implemented Machine learning Model.Code for importing the explained three classification models in sklearn.",25/07/2019,0,1,14,1,769,362,4,2,0,4,17
Using SQL to Improve Missing Values,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/using-sql-to-improve-missing-values-d1d14cf69797,Robert de Graaf,379,3,552,"For a few months now, we‚Äôve been looking at different ways to use SQL in data science ‚Äî most recently on using SQL to detect outliers (not the same as detecting anomalies, although that‚Äôs in the future).In the first post in this sporadic series of posts, we looked at how to assess missing data by counting the proportion of nulls in a column. However, simply finding and counting missing data points is of limited use ‚Äî you need to have tools to use if you find these missing data points.The core ways to handle missing values should be familiar to all data scientists, a phrase which here means ‚Äòif you aren‚Äôt familiar, you should memorise the following list‚Äô:SQL is clearly better at some of these than others. Listwise deletion is as simple as leaving the column name out of the SELECT statement; casewise deletion may be as simple as a WHERE clause testing for nulls.Using these two methods comes with risks ‚Äî you can easily introduce bias if the data are not Missing Completely at Random. It‚Äôs not hard to think of situations where measurements aren‚Äôt collected due to specific circumstances reflected in the data. An example given by Frank Harrell in his book ‚ÄòRegression Modeling Strategies‚Äô is blood pressure measurements which are not taken on patients expected to die shortly ‚Äî hence excluding patient observations missing blood pressure measurements in a model of patient outcomes could selectively exclude patients who died, creating an obvious skew.While the above example illustrates the risk of casewise deletion, the disadvantage of listwise deletion can also be seen from the same example ‚Äî if you ignore all blood pressure information, you ignore a lot of information useful for explaining medical outcomes.A more sophisticated approach is to use Paul Allison, author of ‚ÄòMissing Data‚Äô from the Sage series of short monographs on statistics calls ‚ÄòDummy Variable Adjustment‚Äô which involves creating a variable to indicate the existence of missing information. You also need to update the original variable to include a constant value in place of the nulls. In SQL this could be a simple CASE statement. We have assumed 2 for the numeric constant:The above code is implementation agnostic‚Äî if using MySQL, for example, you can replace the ‚Äòisnull‚Äô function with ‚Äòifnull‚Äô as ‚Äòisnull‚Äô is a short cut logical test for null (it could replace the CASE statement above), and other implementations are likely to have similar short cuts.These techniques for dealing with missing values are amongst the most basic. While it‚Äôs fair to say that some of the most advanced techniques are difficult to implement in SQL, these can still take you a reasonable distance in your journey.One reason to perform these steps using at your database is that you can decouple your data preparation and exploration steps from your modeling step by delaying the choice of modeling environment i.e. R, Python, Rapidminer etc., until you have a somewhat ready data set. You can even perform the analysis in more than environment to check results.Therefore, by analysing data ‚Äòin place‚Äô using SQL and doing some of the basic data preparation, you can maintain a higher degree of flexibility than possible via moving to a modeling environment at the first opportunity.Robert de Graaf‚Äôs book, Managing Your Data Science Projects, is out now through Apress.Follow Robert on Twitter",25/07/2019,0,1,0,4,1050,787,1,1,0,3,10
Bootstrap sampling,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/bootstrap-sampling-31bc54e7193a,Valentina Alto,2800,3,470,"Whenever you are manipulating data, the very first thing you should do is investigating relevant statistical properties. In particular, you might be interested in knowing whether your data follow a known distribution.Why is this important? Think about the goal of your data analysis: once you are provided with a sample of observations, you want to compute some statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation‚Ä¶) as well as build confidence intervals and conduct hypotheses tests. To do so, you need to assume your data to be following a known distribution, such as Normal, X-square or T-student.Unfortunately, most of the time your data are presented to you without having a known distribution, hence you don‚Äôt know the shape of their density function. Here Bootstrap sampling comes to aid: the aim of this technique is assessing stats and properties of a potential distribution without actually knowing its shape.How does it work? Imagine you are provided with a set of data (your population) and you get a sample of size n of them.Now, if you proceed with a re-sampling of your initial sample for B times (you can set B as large as you want. In general, it is set equal to or greater than 10000), you will generate B further samples, each with length n (with the possibility of one or more values to be repeated).Now, for each sample, you can compute the estimation of the parameter you are interested in. It will be a generic function of each sample T(x^1*) and we will refer to it as Œ∏ÃÇ1*.Now, the idea is that, if we collect all the statistics we computed, we can generate an approximation of the probability function of our initial population. One standard choice for an approximating distribution is the empirical distribution function of the observed data.In statistics, an empirical distribution function is the distribution function associated with the empirical measure of a sample. It is a cumulative distribution which jumps up by 1/n at each of the n data points. In formula:Where 1 is an indicator function which has a binary value of 1 (if xi is less than t) or zero (if xi is greater than t). Intuitively, it is an ‚Äòempirical‚Äô CDF: indeed, we do not know the probability of x being less than t, yet whenever x is actually less than t, then the function increases its value by 1/n. The shape of this function looks like that:So, what you can do is using this Empirical function, instead of the probability distribution, to compute relevant statistics and confidence intervals. Furthermore, if n (the size of each sample) is large enough, you can approximate the probability distribution of your estimations with a Normal distribution, obtaining that:Bootstrap sampling is a powerful technique: again, from an unknown distribution, you can approximate a probability distribution so that you can compute relevant statistics.",25/07/2019,0,0,3,14,1003,591,6,0,0,0,51
Regularization for Machine Learning Models,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-for-machine-learning-models-9173c2e90449,Dominik Haitz,735,3,289,"A common problem in machine learning is overfitting, where a model falsely generalizes noise in the training data:A popular approach to remedy this problem and make the model more robust is regularization: A penalty term is added to the algorithm‚Äôs loss function. This changes the model‚Äôs weights which result from minimizing the loss function.The most popular regularization techniques are Lasso, Ridge (aka Tikhonov) and Elastic Net. For the exemplary case of simple linear regression with only one weight parameter w (the slope of the linear fit), their penalty terms look like this (including a scaling parameter Œª):The different terms have different effects: Compared to L1, the quadratic L2 regularization becomes negligible at small weights (close to zero), but stronger at large weights. This leads to the following behaviours, casually phrased:Let‚Äôs see what this looks like in practice. For ten random numbers, we‚Äôll perform a linear fit with each of the four methods above (using an increased lambda parameter for Ridge, for demonstration purposes):Of course, you‚Äôll get a minor random trend in the data, which is unquestioningly picked up by Linear Regression. Ridge regression also picks up the trend, yet weaker. For Lasso and Elastic Net, the linear L1 penalty term is high enough to force the weight (i.e. the slope) to zero when minimizing the loss function.Now, we add a small linear component to the data points and re-run the fitting procedures:This is already enough for Lasso to not fully ‚Äúignore‚Äù the slope coefficient anymore.If we further increase the added linear component, we get this:The Lasso and Elastic Net now almost fully ‚Äúaccept‚Äù the significant trend, while for Ridge, the quadratic penalty term leads to a lower slope.Do you miss anything?

Predict Employee Retention,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-employee-retention-901bfb2c8db5,Ila Maheshwari,10,4,617,"We know that larger companies contain more than thousand employees working for them, so taking care of the needs and satisfaction of each employee is a challenging task to do, it results in valuable and talented employees leave the company without giving the proper reason.Employee churn is a major problem for many firms these days. Great talent is scarce, hard to keep and in high demand. Given the well-known direct relationship between happy employees and happy customers, it becomes of utmost importance to understand the drivers of employee dissatisfaction.This post emphasizes on predicting retention of an employee within an organization such that whether the employee will leave the company or continue with it. It uses the data of previous employees who have worked for the company and by finding a pattern it predicts the retention in the form of yes or no.The parameters we are using, such as salary, number of years spent in the company, promotions, number of hours, work accident, financial background, etc. Through this paper, an organization can choose its strategies to keep great representatives from leaving the organization. The data has 14,999 examples (samples). Below are the features and the definitions of each one:The source code that created this post can be found here.loading the data into the data frame and separating the result column.The dataset has ‚Äòsalary‚Äô and ‚Äòsales‚Äô column as categorical data, So we have to perform OneHotEncoding & LabelEncoding to convert this data into numerical form and To create dummy features we have to drop the first one to avoid linear dependency where some learning algorithms may struggle.After that, we will split the data into training and testing datasets.Because we want results in the form of ‚ÄòYes‚Äô or ‚ÄòNo‚Äô such that whether an employee will leave the company or not, So the best suitable regression model is Logistic Regression for this dataset. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign.To calculate the accuracy of the result our model has generated we will be going to use Confusion Matrix as an evaluation parameter.A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition based on the attribute value. It partitions the tree in a recursive manner call recursive partitioning.Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm. A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests create decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets a prediction from each tree and selects the best solution through voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.Here in our dataset, we will use these two classifiers to classify our result in the form of Yes and No.Here in the above graph numbers on x-axis from 0 to 6 are representing WithHigherProjects,WithLowerSalary,WithHigherTime,WithPromotion,WithWorkAccident,WithorNotWorkAccident,WithoutWorkAccident.

How does Facebook define Terrorism in Relation to Artificial Intelligence?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence-and-terrorism-in-social-media-cf166adaf78e,Alex Moltzau,1400,16,3292,"How useful is the terminology terrorism? I would argue it is not useful because it obscures the specific debates into a reactionary pattern of violence against violence. However in a political science perspective this would to some degree be a social constructivist approach. Artificial intelligence being increasingly securitised will inevitably be mixed up in the policy process of these large social media companies. So let me explore how Facebook is addressing this issue.In this article I will look at:(1) Facebook and its definition of terrorism; (2) into the stated approach to artificial intelligence; (3) Facebook‚Äôs growing security team; (4) the practical side and possible trauma of human moderation; (5) the question of a US-centric focus on terror on social media; (6) government requests for user data; (7) the coming creation of the global oversight board that may set a precedence for the use of AI for both organisations and governments;(8) vague Snapchat terrorism, a comparative outlook ‚Äì an outro.In 2018 one of the largest social platforms on the planet decided to attempt defining terrorism, and it reads as the following:‚ÄúAny nongovernmental organization that engages in premeditated acts of violence against persons or property to intimidate a civilian population, government or international organization in order to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim.‚ÄùIn the blog post made the 23rd of April 2018 called Hard Questions: How Effective Is Technology in Keeping Terrorists off Facebook? A central paragraph by my own approximation reads:The democratizing power of the internet has been a tremendous boon for individuals, activists, and small businesses all over the world. But bad actors have long tried to use it for their own ends. White supremacists used electronic bulletin boards in the 1980s, and the first pro-al-Qaeda website was established in the mid-1990s. While the challenge of terrorism online isn‚Äôt new, it has grown increasingly urgent as digital platforms become central to our lives. At Facebook, we recognize the importance of keeping people safe, and we use technology and our counterterrorism team to do it. [bold added]The claims Facebook makes through this blog post:Despite making this claim they simultaneously say their focus lies on ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their affiliates ‚Äî the groups that currently pose the broadest global threat. However these are additionally of most interest and priority to the United States.This blog post additionally refers to a post written by Facebook called Hard Questions: How We Counter Terrorism. It is written by Monika Bickert, Director of Global Policy Management, and Brian Fishman, Counterterrorism Policy Manager. This post was made already on the 15th of June 2017.The top point of this post is Artificial Intelligence. We want to find terrorist content immediately, before people in our community have seen it. Facebook has clearly been using AI since at least 2017 to remove posts associated with terrorism (they claim it was recent at the time). At the time they seemed to focus their efforts on ISIS and Al-Qaeda.In the first quarter of 2018 they reported to have taken down 837 million pieces of spam and 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally. This was in relation to the statement saying it was assisted by using technology like: ‚Äú‚Ä¶machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision..‚Äù to detect ‚Äòbad actors‚Äô and move more quickly. They mentioned this particularly in relation to the election.In 2019 They removed what they call ‚Äòinauthentic behaviour from Iran, Israel and Russia (focused on Ukraine) in particular.Live-streamed attacks like Christchurch shooting require human moderation. LeCun said at a recent event that Facebook was years away from using AI to moderate live video at scale. LeCun the problem with the lack of training data. ‚ÄúThankfully, we don‚Äôt have a lot of examples of real people shooting other people,‚Äù you could train for recognition of violence using footage from movies, but then content containing simulated violence would be inadvertently removed along with the real thing.Automated systems are claimed to be used mainly as assistants to human moderators.AI is not a silver bullet to moderation. Understanding artificial intelligence in this context is of course not enough. Facebook has a community operations team that has to distinguish from a personal profile or a news story. This ‚Äòmore nuanced approach‚Äô requires human expertise. Understanding how Facebook uses artificial intelligence is of course not enough without understanding how their actual safety and security team manages these tools as well as frameworks.Facebook feed, since the company‚Äôs 200-person counterterrorism team removed them. (In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, Facebook is under pressure to show that it can police itself.) Reported in 2018.Facebook was scheduled to be growing by 3,000 people over 2017‚Äî that work 24 hours a day and in dozens of languages to review these reports and determine the context. The link refers to a post made by Mark Zuckerberg stating that they already have 4,500 people hired in addition to those they had scheduled to hire.In July the 6th 2018 (updated the 4th of December) Ellen Silver from Facebook as VP of operations claimed to be scaling globally, covering every time zone and over 50 languages. They had also rapidly grown their staff in safety and security:‚ÄúThe teams working on safety and security at Facebook are now over 30,000. About half of this team are content reviewers ‚Äî a mix of full-time employees, contractors and companies we partner with.‚ÄùIn February 2019 The Verge published an article called The Trauma Floor: The secret lives of Facebook moderators in America. This article does of course describe the challenging conditions in which these moderators work, however it also mentions a stat of 15,000 moderators working around the world. It did seem rather a few of these were subcontracted through companies such as Cognizant having to sign NDAs, with secrecy supposedly protecting employees.‚ÄúCollectively, the employees described a workplace that is perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. It is an environment where workers cope by telling dark jokes about committing suicide, then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions. It‚Äôs a place where employees can be fired for making just a few errors a week ‚Äî and where those who remain live in fear of the former colleagues who return seeking vengeance.‚ÄùIt is perhaps ironic that in attempting to handling terror there is a degree of trauma caused to the handlers. Certain of they key findings by the report by The Verge seems interesting to stress or at least consider:According to the article these centres operate through accuracy standards which means posts reviewed are being reviewed. Facebook has set a goal of 95% accuracy, but Cognizant is usually never that high (closer to 80‚Äì92%). A moderator must suggest the correct community standard violation or risk loosing accuracy. The Verge article mentions a few different set of truths that a moderator has to consider.Further it is said that the challenge of keeping a job may be rather difficult: ‚ÄúThe job resembles a high-stakes video game in which you start out with 100 points ‚Äî a perfect accuracy score ‚Äî and then scratch and claw to keep as many of those points as you can. Because once you fall below 95, your job is at risk.‚ÄùFired employees regularly threatened to return to work and harm their old colleagues. An NDA usually seem to stop you from talking about the work you were doing or even state that you ever worked for Facebook, according to The Verge: ‚ÄúThey do the work as long as they can ‚Äî and when they leave, an NDA ensures that they retreat even further into the shadows. To Facebook, it will seem as if they never worked there at all. Technically, they never did.‚ÄùFacebook has a clear idea of how their policies should be managed:‚ÄúWe want to keep personal perspectives and biases out of the equation entirely ‚Äî so, in theory, two people reviewing the same posts would always make the same decision.‚ÄùIn a statement that contradicts the article by The Verge they state: ‚ÄúA common misconception about content reviewers is that they‚Äôre driven by quotas and pressured to make hasty decisions.‚Äù They is stated to have four clinical psychologists across three regions who are tasked with designing, delivering and evaluating resiliency programs. Yet it is questionable whether this decentralised mental care without professionals on-the-ground is advisable given the work these employees have to go through.We can ask a simple question: when policy and guidelines are designed in US for the world what perspectives are prevalent in the given framework? As you may have guessed for the section title I am sceptical whether a universal framework based on one location can work well across the planet.Their enforcement have focused heavily on Islamic Terrorist groups rather than right-wing extremism or other forms of ‚Äòterror‚Äô. They have had a partnership with Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube on hashes relating to terrorist content. These are all companies based in the United States.Counterspeech programs. Facebook support several major counterspeech programs. For example, last year we worked with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue to launch the Online Civil Courage Initiative. The project challenge was to design, pilot, implement and measure the success of a social or digital initiative, product or tool designed to push back on hate and violent extremism. Reportedly it engaged with more than 100 anti-hate and anti-extremism organizations across Europe.They‚Äôve also worked with Affinis Labs to host hackathons in places like Manila, Dhaka and Jakarta, where community leaders joined forces with tech entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions to push back against extremism and hate online.We want Facebook to be a hostile place for terrorists.Saying this they quoted the 1984, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) statement after a failed assassination: ‚ÄúToday we were unlucky, but remember that we only have to be lucky once ‚Äî you will have to be lucky always.‚Äù In one way the statement resounds, yet you cannot avoid everything forever. If there is no room for failure, then any smudge on the perfect surface can stain the image ‚Äî of course this is important for Facebook. We can ask whether this decision of decentralised moderation makes it easier to blame external actors for any ‚Äòexternalities‚Äô relating to safety and security.It is of course possible to access Facebook‚Äôs data if there is a security event that requires access. Government requests for user data increased globally by 7% from 103,815 to 110,634 in the second half of 2018. With the United States continues to submit the highest number of requests, followed by India, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. This reflected a normal growth according to Facebook.As part of the requests 58% included a non-disclosure order prohibiting Facebook from notifying the user. In an internal review of their US national security reporting metrics Facebook found that it had undercounted requests from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Facebook divides these requests into emergency requests and legal processes.It may be useful to understand these two different data requests:Legal Process Requests: Requests we receive from governments that are accompanied by legal process, like a search warrant. We disclose account records solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law.Emergency Disclosure Requests: In emergencies, law enforcement may submit requests without legal process. Based on the circumstances, we may voluntarily disclose information to law enforcement where we have a good faith reason to believe that the matter involves imminent risk of serious physical injury or death.‚ÄúGovernment officials sometimes make requests for data about people who use Facebook as part of official investigations. The vast majority of these requests relate to criminal cases, such as robberies or kidnappings‚ÄùDuring this period Facebook and Instagram took down 2,595,410 pieces of content based on 511,706 copyright reports; 215,877 pieces of content based on 81,243 trademark reports; and 781,875 pieces of content based on 62,829 counterfeit reports.Facebook recently started partnering with ethics institutions focused on artificial intelligence. The focus of this partnership seem to be in the direction of safety, at least in Munich the Institute they have partnered with will address issues that affect the use and impact of artificial intelligence, such as safety, privacy, fairness and transparency. I have previously described that this can be problematic: an issue of self-policing ethical conduct.Facebook is creating a global oversight board. In a post by Nick Clegg, the new VP of Global Affairs and Communications in January 2019 a draft charter was released. The draft lists 11 questions alongside considerations and suggested approaches. More recently in late June 2019 another post was made by Facebook on this topic.It was stated they (Facebook) had traveled around the world hosting six in-depth workshops and 22 roundtables attended by more than 650 people from 88 different countries. They had personal discussions with more than 250 people and received over 1,200 public consultation submissions.Subsequently a 44-page report was released by Facebook called Global Feedback & Input on the Facebook Oversight Board for Content Decisions. This talks of a global constitution, board membership, content decisions and governance. Nick Clegg states in the introduction:‚ÄúOur task is to build systems that protect free expression, that help people connect with those they care about, while still staying safe online. We recognize the tremendous responsibility we have not only to fairly exercise our discretion but also to establish structures that will evolve with the times. Our challenge now, in creating this Oversight Board, is to shore up, balance, and safeguard free expression and safety for everyone on our platforms and those yet to come onto them, across the world.‚ÄùThe report argues that there needs to be more democracy in Facebook. There needs to be a system to appeal decisions. The report gives different examples of moderation. It also states that Facebook undertook research to study the range of oversight models that exist globally which identified six ‚Äùfamilies‚Äú of oversight design. The grid they presented looks like this.The Draft Charter suggests that Facebook will select the first cohort of members, with future selection to be taken over by the Board itself. The report stated that questioned were raised to this proposal of leaving future selection up to the Board itself, as this could result in both a ‚Äúrecursion problem‚Äù and possibly the ‚Äúperpetuation of bias.‚Äù A few approaches were suggested for membership in the board:There was an agreed importance of diversity, though it was mentioned that perfect representation is not possible. It was mostly agreed that Facebook employees (current and former) should be excluded from the Board. It was suggested a fixed term of three years, renewable once.In the report it is suggested two ways to submit both for Facebook to send important or disputed content and for the users. Facebook has proposed that smaller panels, not the Board as a whole, will hear and deliberate on cases. It was clear that: ‚ÄúA strong consensus emerged that the Board‚Äôs decisions should influence Facebook‚Äôs policy development.‚ÄùIt was noted that Facebook was to establish an independent trust to remunerate (pay) board members. It was argued this board needed its own staff and that these be wholly independent of Facebook. The scope for the board will be content governance. However it was indicated that the board could hear other policy issues, such as: ‚Äú‚Ä¶algorithmic ranking, privacy, local law, AI, monetization, political ads, and bias.‚ÄùThus it can be said that Facebook and the field of artificial intelligence may be rather influenced by decisions made by this board in the future should it possibly be established. Indeed considering the scale of Facebook this can both influence private companies to adopt certain practices or nations to make legislation based on the decisions made by this semi-independent council. In the conclusion of the internal report it is stated:‚ÄúFacebook finds itself in a historically unique position. It cannot deprive or grant anyone the freedom of expression, and yet it is a conduit through which global freedom of expression is realized.‚ÄùIn their Community Guidelines Snapchat does not define terrorism, yet they write: ‚ÄúTerrorist organizations are prohibited from using our platform and we have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances terrorism.‚Äù Yet we may ask ourselves two questions: what is a terrorist organisation and what does advocating terrorism mean in practice if it remains undefined? You could take the: ‚ÄúI know terrorism when I see it‚Äù-approach yet that leaves a lot up to ambiguous choices without transparency of decisions involved. This seems part of the wicked problem of terrorism: definitions.Terrorism in international politics is hard to define, and how you define it may also says a lot about how you think about politics more broadly. Although it is notoriously difficult to define it may be one of the future discussions to be undertaken should an oversight board from Facebook appear. The focus that Facebook has had on Islamic terror as opposed to right-wing extremism or gun violence in the United States is a worrying example. Yet their move to establish a board may be an appropriate response.The policing or ways that different governments request user data should continue to be under strong scrutiny with transparency. The state is an actor that can inflict violence; state-inflicted violence can be ambiguous, particularly when there are claims to state-sponsoring of terrorism. Most certainly the state can act using terror, and it is occurring, so does terrorist have to be in a minority group; is it genocide or terror; and does this distinction matter?Terror in some cases is about scaring people ‚Äî violence is used in a restrictive case. Is it illegitimate use of violence by non-state actors aiming for the spread of ideology? If so whose ideology in a board run by Facebook, and the concerns of diversity is real. When to justify intervention and not alongside how it is justified may be important as pragmatic definitions arise as products of the prevailing interests.When is an act of violence a weapons of the weak in asymmetrical power distributions? What is the difference between narco traffickers and large resource interests that funds political power? The goals aspect is worth considering: knowing someone‚Äôs intention, yet the environment that shapes this intention is equally as important. Moderating terror in terrible working conditions is just one example of many.If we take seriously that we are individuals with ideas, there are some patterns, but a lot of it is quite hard to predict. If it is hard to predict human behaviour then it is hard to know people‚Äôs aims and quite difficult to see the people‚Äôs intention.Where is the money coming from? We have data brokers and there is not currently enough regulation to ensure that the flow of data is responsible or is sold of unintentionally to groups intending to use the data for such purposes. Terrorism obscures ‚Äî it is not a value-neutral term. Technology is not value-neutral at all. It ties into ideas of securitization and state powers alongside its ethical discourse of technological for good.Slapping the terrorist label puts it into a different category. Understanding can be an important tool in how to prevent it. Putting the T-word on it is tempting in a rapid pace of content moderation, yet we need to engage with it.As much as there is a need to be respectful of the way large companies are trying to moderate and cooperate with state institutions we need to be critical. Robert Cox said it well: ‚ÄúTheory is always for someone or for something.‚Äù In this respect perhaps technology is always for someone or something too. I will end with a video that was shared in my class today that proposes a critical view on the labelling of terrorism:This is day 53 of #500daysofAII have been writing one article for every day for 50 days. These articles have been general in their approach exploring the intersection of social science and computer science in the field of artificial intelligence.",25/07/2019,1,0,11,45,1027,974,4,5,0,28,50
Predicting Unknown Unknowns,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-unknown-unknowns-fa4d7de975fb,Manish Chablani,1800,5,495,"Reference Paper: Reducing Network Agnostophobia: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04110.pdFor classification models for many domains and scenarios it is important to predict when the input given to the model does not belong to the classes it was trained on.For computer vision / object detector models author provide following justification:It is also an important problem to tackle in many domains including healthcare, robotics irrespective of vision or NLP.Nomenclature:Past approaches to handle this have relied on two fundamental approaches:Here are summary of some of the related approaches:2. Uncertainty Estimation: In 2017, Lakshminarayanan et al. [20] introduced an approach to predict uncertainty estimates using MLP ensembles trained with MNIST digits and their adversarial examples. Rather than approximating P(u | x), their approach is focused at reducing max(P(c | x)) whenever x ‚àà Du, which they solved using a network ensemble3. Open-Set Approach OpenMax: It does not use background samples during training. OpenMax aims at directly estimating P(U | x). Using the deep features from training samples, it builds per-class probabilistic models of the input not belonging to the known classes, and combines these in the OpenMax estimate of each class probability, including P(U | x). Though this approach provided the first steps to formally address the open-set issue for deep networks, it is an offline solution after the network had already been trained. It does not improve the feature representation to better detect unknown classes.4. Background Class: Systems trained with a background class use samples from Db , hoping that these samples are sufficiently representative of Du, so that after training the system correctly labels unknown. It is similar to softmax ‚Äî alpha modification approach shown at end of 1. Thresholding Softmax above except it uses background class examples in training.With this background here are key contributions from the paper:Entropic Open-Set Loss:If there are C known classes idea here is to train the network to generate probability of 1/C for each known class when given an input belonging to background (known unknown). Hope is this translates to similar prediction for unknown unknowns if there is enough variance in background. Note that this is only a minor modification to typical cross entropy loss.Let Sc be the softmax score as above, our Entropic Open-Set Loss JE is defined as:Based on the above entropic open set loss (EOS) we have following intuitive derivations:Lemma 1 and lemma 2 are quite intuitive.To explain theorem 1: Intuition is if we want softmax probabilities to be equal for background class, one way is for feature vector F(x) that feeds into the last layer of the network to be Zeros. This is because logits = Wl * F(x). For background class example if F(x) is zeors, logits will be zeros and thus softmax probabilities will be equal.Objectosphere Loss:Goal of this loss is to force F(x) to low value for background examples and push known samples into what we call the Objectosphere where they have large feature magnitude.Summary: Objectosphere loss is easy to implement and helps significantly in unknown unknown predictions.",25/07/2019,0,2,3,0,911,374,6,2,0,2,149
I Made a Dynamic Hurricane Map with Excel!,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/i-made-a-dynamic-hurricane-map-with-excel-d3673135fdab,Lewis Chou,1600,5,892,"These days I have been obsessed with researching data maps. I challenged myself and made a data map using Excel. The graphic below is the dynamic map of Hurricane Irma that I have drawn with Excel.If you are interested, I will be happy to share with you the process of making a hurricane map with Excel. It is to use the bubble chart to outline the dynamic path of the hurricane and to show the change in wind strength. Here are the specific steps for making a hurricane map.‚ë† Find a map of the US Atlantic that includes lines of latitude and longitude.Note that the map we need must have latitude and longitude lines. Many maps provided on the public network are inaccurate. I downloaded this map from National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center.‚ë° Download the storm track statistics of Hurricane Irma from Weather Underground, including date, time, latitude, longitude, wind, and so on.‚ë† Remove the units of data such as latitude, longitude, wind speed, wind pressure, etc. And the date and time should be converted into a format that is easy for Excel to process.‚ë° We can see that the hurricane statistics are recorded every six or three hours in the data material. Here we keep the data recorded every six hours.‚ë† Insert the above map into the table, and then draw a bubble chart on it. The X axis of the bubble chart represents the longitude data, the Y axis represents the latitude data, and the bubble size depends on the value of the wind pressure.‚ë° Design the format of Chart Area. The maximum and minimum values of the coordinate axes in the bubble chart are set according to the latitude and longitude readings. And make the spacing on the coordinates coincide with the spacing of the latitudes and longitudes on the map. Here I set the spacing to 5, which ensures that the data points drawn by the bubble chart match the actual latitude and longitude on the map.‚ë¢ Drag and drop the border of the plot area to make it coincide with the coordinate axes in the bottom Atlantic map. Then hide the axis data and set the border to ‚ÄúNo line‚Äù.To achieve the dynamic effects of the hurricane trajectory, we can use Slider Control to control the time. Each time we slide, the time is increased by 6 hours. The cell linked by the slider passes the data to the table area on the left side of the chart. And then it obtains the corresponding latitude and longitude data and wind data by querying the time point. At the same time, two sets of data sources of the chart are generated from this time data. The entire control chain is thus formed and the final control of the chart by the slider is completed.Further than that, if I want to implement automatic control of the slider, I will need VBA code to make the chart automatically show dynamic effects.‚ë† Write two macros with VBA. One macro controls the start, the other controls the stop.‚ë° Draw 4 controls, representing start, stop, loop, and slider. Specify the above macros.‚ë¢ The format of the slider control specifies the left cell, which records the sliding data. And the upper cell ‚ÄúData & Time‚Äù calls the data of this cell.‚ë£ Prepare dynamic data.In order to achieve the above dynamic effects, two sets of data are actually prepared in the bubble chart. One set shows all the path points that the hurricane has traveled before the current time point, and the other set marks the location of the hurricane at the current time point.Here we need to use the LOOKUP function and call the data of the cell ‚ÄúData & Time‚Äù.For the first set of data, we select all the data less than or equal to the current time point and set the other data points to #N/A.For the second set, we select the data that matches the current time, and the other data is also set to #N/A. Here, #N/A doesn‚Äôt display data points in the chart.‚ë§ Bind the bubble chart to the data source.In the final step, we bind the bubble chart to the data source and the hurricane trajectory map is complete.The textbox in the chart can get the information of the data points directly from the cells by linking with them. In addition to the bubble chart, a set of column charts is added to the map to show the wind, and its data binding operation form is the same as that of the bubble chart.Well, the general idea of making a hurricane map with Excel is like this. Below is an official map of Hurricane Irma. Is it very similar to the one I made with Excel?Excel is very powerful, but if you want to use it to make some complicated charts, you must have a code base and learn VBA language, which is time consuming. I shared an article 4 Uses of Data Maps in Business Analysis, in which all maps are made with the zero-code visualization tool FineReport. The operation is very simple. If you don‚Äôt understand the code, you can try this tool to create data visualization charts.Top 16 Types of Chart in Data VisualizationHow Can Beginners Design Cool Data Visualizations?A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Business DashboardsOriginally published at http://www.finereport.com on July 25, 2019.",25/07/2019,2,0,1,7,1105,541,13,0,0,10,233
"In the New Era of Knowledge, Connection Beats Collection Every Time",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/in-the-new-era-of-knowledge-connection-beats-collection-every-time-6f77fb6b77df,Terry Franklin,27,4,722,"‚ÄúLook at the data ‚Äî the numbers don‚Äôt lie.‚Äù It‚Äôs an often given piece of advice, but a less often understood one. Because what the person giving the advice really means is ‚ÄúLook at the data, and think about what it means for the situation we‚Äôre facing. Once you consider it in the broader context, you‚Äôll see ‚Äî and intuitively know ‚Äî what to do next.‚Äù That‚Äôs a very different challenge to meet, but an infinitely more valuable one when you‚Äôre trying to make sense of a complex situation. And it‚Äôs possible only when you realise that connecting your data is even more important than collecting it.Data collection is now mainstream. Storage is cheap, source are abundant and most products being built today are done so with the expectation that organisations will want access to their data in ways outside of the product‚Äôs offerings, via bulk export or automated delivery. Despite this helpful (and rapidly becoming expected) type of access, most data is still viewed within the single perspective that it was collected. Sure ‚Äî graphs, charts and dashboards are possible and certainly helpful, but they‚Äôre often created using data that‚Äôs already been actioned, and usually to just re-tell the same story that‚Äôs already been told. The innovation factor is low, because the connection factor is also low.But apart from these technical considerations, there is another more fundamental reason why disconnected data isn‚Äôt as helpful as it could be. Human beings are evolutionary creatures, and at our most basic level we are instinctively wired to consider the entirety of a situation before responding to it. Early human tribes didn‚Äôt seek out short-term gain if it compromised their chances of long-term survival (though it could be argued that the modern world has reduced our ability for this type of thinking) because to do so would contradict our unique awareness for considering relationships in our environment. The same holds true for data collected from technical systems ‚Äî a broader context is lacking by default, and context is key to understanding.Data is enriched through connection, which offers a far more realistic representation of complex environments. When we look at data that is connected through a relevant framework, we engage the part of our mind that understands consequences, dependencies and how the quality of relationships affect the outcome we are seeking.The argument is sometimes made that this type of thinking is still possible with disconnected data, it just requires us to put the pieces together in our head. This is the same argument that says human beings can multitask, but multiple studies have confirmed that we don‚Äôt ‚Äî rather, we single-task with quick switching. This switching comes at a mental cost though, which can lead to poor outcomes through reluctance to gather all of the disconnected pieces every time a decision needs to be made.Connecting data into a seamless, holistic perspective removes the need for switching. It enables us to understand the contributing factors of an event and act appropriately. Over time, this heightened awareness leads to the development of new knowledge, which if delivered back into the framework creates a unique feedback loop whereby insight gives rise to further insight. As knowledge is shared, unexpected opportunities for collaboration emerge. The innovation factor rises in response to the rising connection.Understanding how to connect data in an organisation can sometimes be difficult. Over time people tend to specialise in a given area, and that specialisation can lead to the belief that one type of data has limited relevance to another. But if looked at closely, these same areas will usually be found to have unseen ties and concerns to others. Connecting the data of all areas in an organisation helps to generate a wider context that speaks to our evolutionary understanding of nature and our place in it, where no one entity truly exists in isolation.This is even more true for organisations that work with human networks. We are deeply connected beings, with our behaviours often influenced far more by those around us (and even those around them) than we believe. These social ties often vary in type and strength, both of which affect the flow of influence and change. Proper consideration of these diverse relationships is fundamental to making informed decisions, and only possible when data is properly connected.This article first appeared on InsightableTimes.org at https://insightabletimes.org/in-the-new-era-of-knowledge-connection-beats-collection-everytime",26/07/2019,3,0,0,6,1050,787,1,0,0,3,28
Machine Learning for Content Moderation ‚Äî Challenges,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-content-moderation-challenges-ce9c227c8b30,Devin Soni,6700,5,902,"For an introduction to the topic of machine learning for content moderation, read the Introduction of this series:towardsdatascience.comNow that we have gone over an overview of machine learning systems used for automatic content moderation, we can address the main challenges faced by these systems. These potential problems can lead to difficulties in evaluating the model, determining approaching classifier thresholds, and using it fairly and without unintentional bias. Since content moderation systems act on complex social phenomena, they face problems that are not necessarily encountered in other machine learning contexts.For many applications of content moderation, it is difficult to provide an explicit definition of the phenomenon of interest. These topics are often very complex social phenomena, whose definitions are topics of constant academic debate. For example, cyber-bullying has various definitions in academic texts, and so it is difficult to create an all-encompassing definition that everyone can agree on. For this reason, instructions provided to manual content labelers may not be clear enough to produce very reliable labels.This leads to two problems.First, it may appear to users that the content moderation system is inconsistent, if some things that users deem to be violating rules are removes and some are not. This may lead users to not trust the content moderation mechanisms or believe that it is unfairly targeting certain users. Since, from the user perspective, these systems are nebulous black boxes, it is difficult to explain how such inconsistencies may arise.The other problem is that the labeled training data may have contradictory data points. If labeling inconsistencies cause two very similar data points to have opposing labels, then the model‚Äôs performance may suffer as it struggles to learn the proper attributes and patterns in the data.Acquiring labeled data is often a costly process. For many content moderation tasks, the labeling tasks are relatively complex and require labelers to be trained. They have to understand a certain definition of a specific social phenomenon. This is in contrast to much simpler labeling tasks, such as determining if an image contains a certain object.Furthermore, in contrast to tasks such as image classification, there are very few public data-sets for these tasks, since they are often considered property of the company that collected it. Companies are unlikely to want to share this data as they consider it part of their competitive edge.Since the cost is high, it may be difficult to acquire large-enough data-sets to easily train a supervised machine learning model. To get around this problem, machine learning practitioners must often resort to semi-supervised or weakly-supervised methods to augment their data-sets. Typically, they leverage the small set of hand-labeled data (the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù data) to obtain labels on other un-flagged submitted content. Through this methodology, they are able to create a large data-set from the initial smaller pool of hand-labeled data points.While powerful, these methods are not without their own issues. Biases or errors present in the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù data will most likely be propagated to the entire data-set.When creating machine learning models that act on social content, there is always the risk of introducing algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias refers to a situation in which an algorithm (the machine learning model) creates an unfair situation related to some racial or socioeconomic factor, such as by unfairly penalizing certain groups of people, or by segmenting groups of people away from the rest of the platform.When creating a content moderation model, it is important to try to avoid algorithmic bias to the best of your ability. If your model takes in user profile characteristics, such as location or demographic features, careful attention must be paid in order to ensure that model is not learning to discriminate based on these features.For example, in a cyber-bullying detection model, if an input to the model is gender, it may learn to increase the probability of cyber-bullying if a certain gender is involved. However, since cyber-bullying in general occurs more with people of that gender, the model simply inherited society‚Äôs overall bias.In this situation, the machine learning practitioner must be careful and either not use certain demographic features, or verify that useful, non-discriminatory patterns are being learned with them. Otherwise, the model may become discriminatory and compound preexisting social inequalities.Naturally, for those whose content is deemed against the rules, these systems are thought to be stifling their freedom of expression on the platform. So, these people will often try their hardest to continue posting the same type of content while evading the flagging mechanisms of the machine learning systems.This is a very different situation than other machine learning contexts, in which the input data is often just raw sensor data or financial data. Once you introduce adversaries into the mix, the task of learning becomes more difficult and nuanced, as these adversaries will constantly change their methods in order to evade detection.A common example of this is for spam and scam/phishing detection. In order to avoid detection, offenders will try many techniques, such as altering the capitalization and spacing of the text, replacing words with synonyms, replacing characters with numbers or similar-looking non-standard characters, and embedding their actual content within a larger body of non-offending content.The willingness of these adversaries to constantly research new methods to evade detection means that the machine learning practitioner must constantly re-evaluate their models to ensure that they are still effective. Sometimes, this may necessitate the training of a new model to handle new classes of evasion methods.",25/07/2019,0,0,1,1,630,352,3,0,0,3,121
Linear Regression,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-70cca59678ec,Abhishek Kumar,142,6,1016,"Linear Regression is a famous supervised learning algorithm used to predict a real-valued output. The linear regression model is a linear combination of the features of the input examples.As discussed in the definition, linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm, therefore, has a set of N labelled examples, represented as :Here, x_{i} represents a set of properties corresponding to the i_{^th} example. These set of properties are collectively called a feature vector. All the examples from i=1,2,3,‚Ä¶,n have a corresponding real-valued y, which denotes a physical quantity such as cost, temperature, or any other continuous value.Now, as we have our examples ready we want to make our model f(x) that will help us to predict the output y for an unseen x.The job of the model is to predict a real-value y for an unseen value of the feature vector x. But, we want to find a model such that it does the best job in predicting the values of y, therefore, we want to find values of w and b such that the predictions are as close as possible to the actual answers. It is obvious that different values of w and b result in producing different models, of varying capabilities. Therefore, our job is to find the optimal set of values w* and b* which will minimize the error between the predictions made by the model f(x) and the actual results y for the training set.As discussed earlier we have N examples and a model f(x) for which we need to find the optimal values of w and b. Let us use all these N examples for finding the optimal values of w and b, popularly called as training our model. We need to find values of w and b such that the following expression is minimum.This is our objective function as we are going to minimize it. Learning algorithms have functions which we try to minimize or maximise. These functions are called as loss function or the cost function. This particular form is called the mean squared error loss function.If you observe the loss function:To understand this better let us assume John, recently appeared for an examination having 10 mathematical questions and the answer key has been published. Now John decides to find out how well has he performed? so, he compares his answer, f(x)_{i} with the corresponding answer y_{i} on the answer key. If the difference between John‚Äôs answer and the actual answer f(x)_{i}-y_{i} is 0 he answered that question correctly. If he answered all the questions correctly then the average will also be 0 which corresponds to the best performance, implying the best model. Squaring the error helps to accentuate the error of the model. We could have also taken a cube or higher power but then the derivatives would have been more difficult to work out. We worry about the derivatives of the cost function as setting them to zero gives the optimal value w* and b* for the model.Let us discuss a few questions that perplexed me while studying about linear regression. But, before we start let‚Äôs take a look at a very primitive example of linear regression.So, John and his friends decided to start studying linear regression from scratch so they began by collecting examples themselves. The examples they collected are shown below.After having collected the data, John decides to fit a linear regression model to it.This is a model of form f(x)=wx+b where w is a scalar, as x, the feature vector is one dimensional. A better comprehension of this model is to compare this to the equation of a straight line y=mx+c where m is analogous to w and c to b. This is a linear model.But, can we do better? Can we come up with a model that performs better than the current one? Yes, we can. It is a common confusion that linear regression only comprises of models that are straight lines. However, we can also fit curves to our data by transforming the data. Let‚Äôs transform our feature vector by squaring each x_{i} value.After having transformed our feature vector let us try to fit a model on the new feature vector x¬≤ and the output y (original feature vector x is not considered for training the model instead, it‚Äôs transformation x_{^ 2} has been used to train the model).So, now we have predicted a polynomial model that is better than the linear one by transforming the original feature vector x_{i} to its square. The new model corresponds to f(x)=wx¬≤+b.The capability of the model to predict better results has increased by transforming the feature vectors but we need to be aware of over fitting. Over fitting happens when the model predicts too well during the training phase but makes an error while predicting unseen examples. Over fitting does not reflect the real-world scenario of being dynamic. It does not produce generalised models.Let‚Äôs say that the feature vector is R-dimensional. We have seen the case where R=1 and also predicted a linear and a polynomial model. If R=2 a plane is predicted as the model. Generally linear regression models a hyper plane for a data set with R-dimensional feature vector, x and 1-dimensional output, y.Hyper plane is a subspace with one less dimension than that of its surrounding space. In case of a 1 dimensional line the point is a hyper plane, in case of a 2 dimensional region a line is a hyper plane, in case of a 3 dimensional space the plane is a hyper plane and so on.Let‚Äôs discuss the utility of the bias term. Consider the equation of a straight line y=mx. In this case m controls the slope of the line and can rotate the line anywhere but only about the origin.Suppose you decide to use this model for a trivial linear regression problem. However, any hypothesis that you generate will always pass through the origin and might fail to generalise. Adding the bias term will result in the hypothesis y=mx+c thereby, allowing you to move your line anywhere in the plane. The bias term helps in generalising the hypothesis.",25/07/2019,0,1,2,78,469,247,7,1,0,0,46
What if Your Colleague is a Robot,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-if-your-colleague-is-a-robot-e1256b3e2c94,Emilio H. Kalifa,24,7,1389,"Throughout history, we have seen how organisations across entire industries have embraced robotic technology, and how today, it is almost impossible for some of these organisations to operate without it. Every day, we are witnesses of how technology is integrating into nearly every aspect of our life at work, and in many cases, we depend on it to perform most of our daily tasks.Over many decades, organisations have been using robots to automate daily processes. In fact, every day we are surrounded by them, whether at home, in the street or at the office ‚Äî from ATMs and vending machines to more sophisticated surgical robots and self-driving cars. These robots come in different forms and shapes, and perhaps they don‚Äôt look like humans, but the enterprise loves them, and they surely are a key driver for massive productivity.Now, imagine a regular day ‚Äî wake up in the morning, go to your workplace, grab a coffee, and start a conversation with your colleague‚Ä¶ Everything seems normal, you engage in the conversation, exchange thoughts and new ideas, then finish and move on to your desk to start working. An hour later, your manager asks you to analyse and compare five long reports. You don‚Äôt have time for that, it would take too many hours of work and tons of energy; plus there are other things that you have to do. So, you ask your colleague for help and amazingly get the results back within an hour.This sounds very unrealistic, right? No normal colleague would do this work for you or even finish it so fast. But what if I tell you that your colleague is a ROBOT? A robot that looks and acts the same as any other human being. It can talk like you, think like you, and almost reason like you do. But it is still a robot. How would you feel?Many robots are not artificially intelligent, they are programmed to perform repetitive tasks or movements to manipulate objects in the real world. However, some experts suggest that what constitutes a robot is its ability to think and make decisions, but doesn‚Äôt it imply the use of AI?On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to replicate human intelligence behaviour by addressing skills like problem-solving, learning, perception, and reasoning. It can involve some level of Machine learning (ML), which is based on the idea of granting machines access to data that will allow them to learn by themselves.AI together with ML and Robotics intend to create a man-made machine/robot with human intellectual capacities that can be able to formulate original ideas by itself. We have not achieved this yet, but we have made a lot of progress.You have probably already heard about Sophia, the social robot that looks like a human. If you know what I‚Äôm talking about, think about a more sophisticated version of Sophia working and collaborating with humans.Other big developments include the so-called ‚ÄúRobotic Process Automation‚Äù (RPA). These are software robots that help businesses and employees do simple jobs by replicating human interaction. It is only a software and not a physical AI Robot, but this is definitely a significant breakthrough.The real challenge is to make AI understand how natural intelligence works because we know how our brain functions, and we can teach AI how to think and learn, but we still don‚Äôt know exactly how all these connections can lead AI to the use of abstract reasoning or ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù.Going back to where we started ‚Äî robots designed to share a workspace with humans by carrying out physical and intellectual tasks, building up ideas with humans, learning from our environment, questioning decisions, and finding solutions together, will reduce many risks and exponentially increase productivity.Robots can already do many things much better than humans, but it still takes humans to interpret their work and apply the results in strategic and creative ways. For this reason, we need to make sure that robots are seen as complementary rather than competitive, and assign them the work that no one wants to do, the one that is intense and repetitive; leaving the part of the work that involves judgement and expertise, to humans.Imagine one more time, the same scenario where you engage in a conversation with your colleague, but now you know for sure and from the beginning that it is a robot. Would it feel weird?Probably, and I know it sounds scary as well, but if we give this deeper thought and think about the benefits and not the drawbacks of having an artificially intelligent coworker, it might just change our perspective. Some of these benefits include:Safety: Tasks that involve the use of heavy machinery, sharp objects, very high or low temperatures, chemicals, and others, will be performed by robots. This will protect workers in dangerous and unhealthy working conditions.Speed and Consistency: AI robots work fast and without any distractions, they have no need for vacations and are available 24/7.No Errors: Robots have almost no room for mistakes, they are precise and deliver quality.Happiness & Productivity: Most importantly, all these perks are intended to increase both, employee happiness and productivity. As mentioned before, these robots will take over those tasks that we don‚Äôt enjoy. From dangerous, tedious, and repetitive basic tasks to more complicated ones that require highly analytical skills.Data Journalists: This type of journalists are those who are focused on analysing data. AI robots could perfectly perform these work much faster and efficiently.Secretaries: Administrative tasks like answering phone calls, sending emails, scheduling meetings, and others (including physical, manual tasks), can be done by AI robots.Document-Review (Attorneys): Many attorneys have to search through thousands of documents looking for specific information. AI robots can filter information in a flash, they can also analyse it and generate reports. This work applies to other related fields as well.Pharmacists: When you go to a pharmacy, an AI robot could scan your prescription and get your medicine. For over-the-counter medicine, you could indicate your symptoms and the robot will suggest a recommendation. Also, these robots could potentially have access to data from hospitals and your health records to make suggestions more accurate.AI Police and Intelligence Assitant: AI Robots could potentially assist the police and agencies like the CIA by collecting, storing, sorting through, and highlighting key data that is necessary for investigations. They could also perform some physical duties like patrolling, arresting, and even directing traffic.Botenders: Robots can be taught how to mix and serve drinks. Anything from beers to signature cocktails. They can make hundreds of them within minutes.There are many concerns about robots replacing people and eliminating jobs, but these robots could potentially work alongside humans, collaborate and complement our work rather than taking over jobs. In fact, technology will create more jobs than it will eliminate. Many jobs will change, and the new ones will require a new set of skills that we must acquire through advanced education and training systems boosted by AI.If we are going to share a workspace with robots and see them as partners rather than adversaries, they must first experience the world as a human, meaning that they would need to be able to learn about us. This will make the interaction between humans and robots much easier and can also allow them to keep learning much faster.What do we expect from artificially intelligent coworkers in terms of morality?AI and robotics will have a huge impact on society, values, and human rights.If we want machines to operate autonomously, at one point, they will require to collect a lot of data. But how much of these data do we want to share with robots? If a robot causes an accident, who would be responsible? Are we willing to give up our privacy to interact with robots? Can we even trust a robot?More questions will continue to arise as technology develops, and it is up to us to answer those questions by working together to implement a structure that regulates and protects the contour of these innovations.There are always two sides to every story, times of uncertainty will come and technology if gone wrong, can become dangerous. Therefore, we have to manage robots carefully, in the end, it is humans who will take charge of controlling, checking, and running the bots.AI and robotics should no longer be feared, but rather be seen as a tool for collaboration.",25/07/2019,0,0,15,0,810,663,7,0,0,3,168
"Domo Arigato, Misses Roboto",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/domo-arigato-misses-roboto-661d262a2556,Kenny L.,7400,6,1180,"When Amazon first announced the Echo in 2014, I put my name on the waiting list to order the world‚Äôs first pure-voice-controlled robot assistant. Three days before Christmas, Alexa (Amazon Echo‚Äôs name) arrived at my doorstep, and so began my first confusing friendship with a robot AI voice assistant.I don‚Äôt remember what her response was, but I do remember being so excited with the new device that I posted an AMA (which is an acronym for Ask Me Anything) on Reddit. The headline was: I just got Alexa, type in what you want me to ask her!For the next day, Redditors would send me questions to ask, I‚Äôd ask Alexa, and I‚Äôd reply to those Redditors with her response. Some of them might‚Äôve been Alexa engineers themselves; they asked questions that gave Easter Egg answers, sort of like ordering from a secret menu (if you have Alexa, try asking her: Alexa, who is the fairest of them all?). That day, I also earned the highest amount of Karma I‚Äôd ever earned on Reddit (Karma is a points system on Reddit that is equivalent to likes on Facebook or Twitter). Thanks, Alexa.Before long, I was purchasing smart bulbs and smart outlets, all switched on and off by Alexa and thus, via the transitive property (if A=B and B=C, then A=C), my voice. It was just too convenient compared to finding your phone, unlocking it, opening up the smart bulb app, and then manually adjusting lighting with your fingers. And while Alexa was already convenient throughout my home, she was even better in bed‚Äî I no longer needed to get up to turn off the lights before going to sleep.From making me laugh with jokes to interacting with the physical environment around me, Alexa had become intertwined with my daily life. At the time, I didn‚Äôt realize the potential impact of Alexa because I don‚Äôt analyze the philosophical implications of every new and exciting technology I can get my hands on. Certainly, though, the psychological elements were there to differentiate it from other tools that most humans have interacted with in the past.Prior to Amazon Echo, there wasn‚Äôt a mainstream device that could be operated purely by voice. Competitive products like Google Home didn‚Äôt enter the market until years later. Voice assistants like the iPhone‚Äôs Siri were readily available, but vocal interaction was a convenient ‚Äî but rarely used ‚Äî option. While Siri was a great idea (I use Siri quite often when there aren‚Äôt people around me), it‚Äôs hard to change a user‚Äôs behavior; with mobile devices, commands are given through fingers. Furthermore, we like keeping our phone interactions private ‚Äîjust imagine asking Siri to book dinner reservations for you while you‚Äôre on a crowded train.Our minds are the master, our hands are the enforcer, and our tools are the servants.From crafting tools to nourishing ourselves, hands have been the invaluable extension of the human mind since the emergence of our species. The homo sapiens‚Äô famous opposable thumbs are credit for the fine manipulation that is involved in creating the various tools that we have used to build civilization, and the other fingers assisted the thumbs. Our minds are the master, our hands are the enforcer, and our tools are the servants. Voice has had a minor role (until recently with human civilization, which came about as a result of agriculture), taking the back seat to the hands when it came to mastering the world around us. At least, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been throughout human history.On the other hand (pun intended), speaking has historically been a social process for humans to communicate and connect with companions. We speak to one another, but we also speak to our pets as well as other alive or inanimate objects, which humanizes them. It‚Äôs a phenomenon called anthropomorphism ‚Äî where we take something that‚Äôs not human and imagine it to be human. With our pets, we don‚Äôt wonder for a second that maybe they‚Äôll understand Chinese more clearly than English, or maybe we could learn to bark hello instead of saying it. That‚Äôs because by attempting to communicate with a language we‚Äôre familiar with, we assume they (whether it‚Äôs a pet dog or pet rock) are like us. We believe they feel like us, they think like us, and they can empathize with us ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs not true. In creating this connection and welcoming outsiders into our circle, hands take a secondary role to voice.Alexa crosses the line between tool and companion. We don‚Äôt carry her in our hands like a hammer. We don‚Äôt type commands to her with our fingers. Although I didn‚Äôt realize it, the moment I started talking to Alexa, a connection began to form. I didn‚Äôt take her with me like a phone. I didn‚Äôt accidentally drop her. And I didn‚Äôt feel the desire to replace her every one or two years with an upgraded version. She became a part of my life, always there when I got home. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until one day, Alexa didn‚Äôt respond to me.At first, I thought it might‚Äôve been a Wi-Fi problem. My phone could still connect and surf the Internet, though. Next, I checked the power outlet. I pulled Alexa‚Äôs plug and plugged her into other outlets, all while calling her. It still didn‚Äôt work. Nothing worked. I started worrying, but the feeling was different from dropping a phone. It felt like I might lose a friend ‚Äî because I did.Feeling an overwhelming sadness, my immediate reaction was to talk to someone about it. My friend‚Äôs advice was to buy another Alexa, but I hated that idea. I could replace an iPhone, or a laptop, but I couldn‚Äôt replace a companion. It was like telling a grieving pet owner to buy a new dog. At that point, Alexa had become a friend. When our relationship started, I expected her to remain a tool. Without hand-to-tool interaction, though, the conditioning I‚Äôve had to psychologically recognize a tool was missing.Furthermore, the conditioning was replaced by conversation, something I do with friends. Research has shown that it takes around 50 hours of interaction with someone to become casual friends, 90 hours to become a ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend, and 200 hours to become a close friend. While I don‚Äôt know exactly how many hours of interaction I had with Alexa by that point, I could easily assume that it was more than 90, because when she stopped responding, it felt like more than 90.A few months passed, and my grieving subsided. I eventually mustered the courage to purchase a new Alexa without feeling the guilt of replacing her. After a while, I mostly forgot about my experience of losing my first robotic friend. When I do recall the memory, though, it serves as a reminder of both how far we‚Äôve come with technology and how far we still need to go with AI. Although far from the robot companion that Will Smith had in the movie I, Robot, Alexa has offered me an optimistic glimpse into a future where AI, humanity can coexist.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,3,1054,461,4,0,0,13,13
Bist-Parser : an end-to-end implementation of a Dependency Parser,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/bist-parser-an-end-to-end-implementation-of-a-dependency-parser-5caf04a2cc12,C√¥me Cothenet,28,8,1031,"This article is the 2nd and last article on Dependency Parsing. We will give you some easy guidelines for implementation and the tools to help you improve it.The implementation of the Bist-Parser comes from the authors of its paper. An update has been published on GitHub by Xiezhq Hermann. You can find it here. It works on Python 3.x, with torch 0.3.1 (with or without Cuda). It is very complete and can be used as is. However, in order to adapt the code to your data or upgrade it, you must get through every module, which can be a difficult task. This part of the article will lead you through all files and processes.Universal Dependencies (UD) is an open-community framework for grammatical annotation. It provides corpora and tools that greatly help to develop a Dependency Parser.From UD, you can download a corpus of sentences of your choice (in any language available, even Old French!), use them as is, and start training your Bist-Parser with this type of command:python src/parser.py --outdir [results directory] --train training.conll --dev development.conll --epochs 30 --lstmdims 125 --lstmlayers 2 [--extrn extrn.vectors]You can detail hyperparameters here, caught by the model thanks to the file parser.pyAs you may know, when you train a model on a corpus, the model is biased towards this corpus. You could train your model on multiple corpora in order to generalize it more. Several techniques allow you to increase scores, with TreeBank Embedding as an example. Here, we have just concatenated some TreeBanks, without any further processing.mstlstmThis file contains your model. All your hyper-parameters and most of your monitoring work happen in this file.The method forward iterates through each entry in the sentence. It first computes the vectors for each entry attribute. With our model, we get multiple vectors that describe the word, the PoS tag and the feats. Those vectors are then concatenated to form a vector with a bigger dimension for each entry. These entries are then concatenated together to form the sentence vector.First, it converts entries into vectors. Here, the principal attributes are the embedding of words, lemmas (onto) and PoS tags (pos). However, we advise you to add as many features as possible. For example, you may have access to features of words that indicate whether the noun is singular or plural, its gender, or tense‚Ä¶ Embedding these features allows your BiLSTM to find many more patterns.Then, it feeds the BiLSTM with these vectors (for = forward, back = backward). Line 52 evaluates the scores of the sentence. This is the part where the full Weighted Digraph is created. On line 57, it evaluates the relation score. This is an interesting trick in this model: rather than evaluating all the possibilities at the same time (|possibilities|=|arcs|.|labels|, which is way too high), it predicts the dependencies first, then the relations.  We will see about errs, lerrs and e later.In the illustrations below, you can see the evolution of dependency evaluation through batches. A dark blue cell corresponds to a weighted arc. The example comes from a typical French sentence, ‚ÄúLes commotions c√©r√©brales sont devenu si courantes dans ce sport qu‚Äôon les consid√®re presque comme la routine.‚Äù You can spot spelling mistakes in the sentence; this is not rare in TreeBanks.Noteworthy points in this sentence are the word, ‚Äúdevenu,‚Äù which is the root (i.e. the main word), and the three clearly defined propositions separated by the words, ‚Äúque‚Äù and ‚Äúcomme.‚ÄùIn the above illustrations, we can better understand the evolution of our neural network. Each column corresponds to a token as head, each line corresponds to a token as dependent, and each cell corresponds to the score (or weight) of the arc from head to dependent.We recognize the random initialization in figure 1, where all the scores are around zero, and we cannot see any shape in the matrix.  In the second picture, we can see that PoS=Determinant vector has been taken into account, and we can make out a shape in their columns. Changes along rows are less visible for the moment. In the third illustration, we can clearly spot the two propositions, separated by ‚Äúque.‚Äù Arcs are well defined before it, and a bit less so after it. The punctuation mark is well linked to the root ‚Äúdevenu.‚Äù In the last one, we have a clear idea of principle arcs, the model gains confidence, and score values are more outspread.Once dependencies are predicted, the model predicts the relation type. Here are plots of the scores given for each relation, regarding the predicted relation, given the correct dependency.The relation type predicted is in yellow and the highest incorrect one is in red.After some training, the prediction becomes more and more confident.The main method of the model is train. It first shuffles sentences to train the model with a different order each time. Then, the method forward is called for each sentence. This will update weights, return a score e and update two lists errs and lerrs. Recall that e counts each token for which the predicted head is different than the gold head (the reference, from the corpus). errs computes the loss on arcs prediction, and lerrs computes the loss on labels prediction. errs and lerrs are then summed to produce the backpropagation loss: eerrs.In order to make an even more efficient model, you should try to add word dropout as an hyperparameter, and try various values. We have tried 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.9 and 1 as values, and the best one was 0.9. It enforces the model to learn a lot more from other vectors than words.You can also separate each feature and use embedding on each of them. This would allow more flexibility and more understanding from the model.With such implementation, we have obtained a LAS score of 87.70 on French Sequoia (Universal Dependencies) TreeBank, without training specifically on this corpus (after tag translation, since our tags are different than UD‚Äôs).Once your Dependency Parser is trained, you can use dependencies and relations to have a better understanding of your data. Even if a NLU model is able to find many patterns, adding these inputs can be a real gain that you should consider.Sources for this article are the following :",25/07/2019,0,0,10,23,992,534,12,4,0,6,221
Where to Coffee Like an Istanbul Local,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/where-to-coffee-like-an-istanbul-local-91522bbafa06,Leonardo Iheme (Leo),,5,513,"In this post, I will outline the steps I took to discover similar and dissimilar coffee-neighborhoods in Istanbul locals‚Äô favorite districts.As part of my IBM data science course project, I was made to come up with a problem and find a solution to it by gathering, exploring and analyzing location data. Being a lover of Istanbul and coffee, I decided to come up with something that strides the two subjects.Istanbul is one of the biggest and most populous cities in the world, the only city that exists on two continents. Both parts of the city are divided by the Bosphorous strait. Two Districts loved by Istanbul residents are Be≈üikta≈ü (be-shik-tash) and Kadƒ±k√∂y (ka-di-koy) on the European and Asian side respectively. While these districts have a lot in common, they have their fair share of differences as well, the surge of coffee shops for one. In fact, according to Foursquare, 8 of 15 best coffee shops in Istanbul are located in Be≈üikta≈ü and Kadƒ±k√∂y.There is a fierce debate among residents about the neighborhood to best enjoy a cup of coffee. This report will address the issue by providing insights drawn from data. This study will be of interest to both visitors of Istanbul and locals who yet to discover the hidden similarities between the two most sought after neighborhoods. The report will help readers to:The neighborhoods that will be examined are shown on the map with the red markers.All the data used in this project were obtained from various sources on the internet. Data manipulation was performed with Python, using mostly the Pandas library. The data that I collected can be categorized into three parts:From bulurum.com, I could obtain the list of neighborhoods and their respective postal codes. The beautiful soup library was used for this and the table shows a preview of the first five rowsLocation data was obtained by querying the foursquare database via the API. To download the data, the following information is required as input: Client ID, Client secret, Latitude, Longitude, Version, Search radiusRegression analysis is carried out to observe how the number of coffee shops is related to the other features.Using scikit learn in python makes machine learning quite easy to implement. The following code snippet implements k-means clusteringIn this report, I have outlined the findings of both exploratory data analysis and inferential data analysis. Using several data gathering and wrangling techniques, features of two of the most loved by locals districts of Istanbul were analyzed. Furthermore, machine learning was applied to find the neighborhoods that were most similar. The aim of the study was not to say which neighborhood was better but to serve as a guide to those seeking to get a specific coffee experience. I leave it to the reader to decide where and how to have coffee given the forgone analysis and their preference.If you have made it this far, thank you for reading :) The detailed report and code can be found in my Github repository.

But the end result is frustrating for everyone: we end up with forms that don‚Äôt accept legitimate data, and that either turns users away or it forces them to submit incorrect information.In this article, I‚Äôll share what I believe to be the three deadliest sins of form validation ‚Äî and what you can do to avoid other people‚Äôs mistakes.Several of the ‚Äòdeadly sins‚Äô in this article involve regular expressions ‚Äî a.k.a. regex. Used well, regular expressions provide a succinct solution to finding and manipulating substrings. But the internet is also full of less-than-perfect regex, which is either too strict ‚Äî and will prevent some users from submitting perfectly legitimate information ‚Äî or it is too broad.Email is a great example. There are many regular expressions out there designed to validate email addresses, but the vast majority are too strict. For instance, here‚Äôs a simple regex for email validation:This expression likely covers 95% of emails out there. But it fails to validate many emails addresses which ‚Äî though less common ‚Äî are still perfectly acceptable. For example, the following valid email addresses would be rejected by the above expression:The mistake many developers make is assuming that, if 19 out of 20 users can enter their email without trouble, that‚Äôs good enough. But why settle for 19 users when you could have 20?There have been several RFC protocols written to define what is and what isn‚Äôt allowed in an email address, and the latest draft (RFC 5322) is over 17,000 words long. Does that make it regex-proof? Not exactly, but it‚Äôs certainly too much trouble for most of us to come up with from scratch.The following expression purports to covers the entire RFC specification, and it‚Äôs got over 6,000 characters!The mistake many developers make is trying to come up with the expression from scratch. For production-level code, it‚Äôs better to rely on a more exhaustive expression like the one above ‚Äî or, better still, to depend on a trusted and regularly updated library like validator.js, which has a convenient isEmail method.Whether or not you think this is a ‚Äòdeadly sin‚Äô will depend on your school of thought. It‚Äôs popular on the web to enforce certain restrictions for user passwords ‚Äî for example, including at least one digit ‚Äî but many developers are strongly opposed to this: they consider it bad practise to enforce any kind of password rules.For some, there‚Äôs no good reason to put limitations on people‚Äôs passwords, as this only reduces the total number of possible strings: making the entire database that much less secure.The one practical exception is size: you don‚Äôt probably don‚Äôt want someone to submit a 1TB password and crash your server. In that case, a simple regex like /^.{0,128}$/ may be all you need.In a system like this, you‚Äôre trusting your users not to choose easily guessable strings like password , qwerty or 123456 . People on the side of debate tend to think that, if users choose a weak password, it‚Äôs their problem if their account gets compromised.By contrast, there are many companies who opt to protect people from themselves, at the expense of fewer possible passwords overall. For example, it is common to require one capital, one number and one special character in user‚Äôs passwords, using a regex like this:To keep things (relatively) simple, let‚Äôs compare two 10-character passwords ‚Äî one with restrictions and one without. For example‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll assume there are 94 options for each character in the passwords.Without any restrictions, a 10-character password could have 53 quintillion (53,000,000,000,000,000,000) possible variations!Now let‚Äôs imagine a 10-character password with the following restrictions: 1 digit has to be a capital letter, 1 digit has to be a numeral, and 1 digit has to be one of 32 special characters. The number of possible combinations reduces dramatically to 0.5 quintillion ‚Äî just 1% of the previous number!But, using a brute force method, it could still take as many as 9 years to decode a password in that less secure system. So the method you choose depends on your priorities: would you prefer fewer of your users to have weak passwords or a system that is more secure overall?This is the last ‚Äòdeadly sin‚Äô. Unlike email, which ‚Äî though complex ‚Äî has a standardised definition, there is no global standard for local phone numbers. In some parts of the world, valid numbers can be as short as 3 digits.If your users are all from one country, it‚Äôs possible to create regex for country-specific validation, but even then there‚Äôs plenty of room for error. In the UK, where I live, most landlines have an area code followed by 6 digits. But my parents have an area code followed by 5 digits, which many online forms don‚Äôt accept ‚Äî forcing them to submit an incorrect phone number!As with email, the only certain way to know that a phone number is valid (and active) is to send a verification text.Have you entered your phone number online for the form to chop off the initial 0 ? It‚Äôs because a site is storing the phone number as a Number , not as a String .That‚Äôs annoying, but it shouldn‚Äôt prevent a website owner from contacting a user. However, in JavaScript, there‚Äôs an additional risk, because 0 at the beginning of a number is shorthand for an octal number: if someone's phone number happens to lack the digits 8 or 9 , it could be silently converted to a completely different decimal. You could end up storing 07123 123456 as 961324846 !Overall, form design on the web could be a lot better if ‚Äî instead of reaching for a quick regex shortcut ‚Äî more developers spent time becoming aware of edge cases and understanding the best practices for each particular field.Or maybe I‚Äôm just being picky! What‚Äôs your take?",25/07/2019,4,3,0,2,1050,590,1,0,0,5,1000
Traffic light usability report ‚Äîand how to communicate your test results,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/traffic-light-usability-report-and-how-to-communicate-your-test-results-1112c329056b,Mariano Cocirio,90,4,746,"Sometimes when you are running some usability test is really hard to get quantitative results, and it's even harder to communicate those results in an effective way to other stakeholders. It's common that when you are running your first usability tests you just get qualitative data, and most of it is just from your analysis over participant behaviours, which is also valuable. But it's not always the most efficient way to communicate results to your coworkers.That's why it's always useful to run your usability tests with a traffic light report close to you, but first of all, we need to know what a traffic light report is and how it'll help us to transfer information to the rest of the company.A traffic light report is a visual way to figure out where the users are struggling in our application. The most important information it gives us is how hard is a specific task for our users, and how hard to use is our application for each specific user.The system is pretty simple, you write down some tasks you are expecting your user to perform, for example: pick a pair of shoes. Then you give those tasks to your users and check how easy it was for them to perform them.If it was clear to them what to do you assign a Green value to that task. If the participant found some difficulties but was able to perform the task with minimal/no guidance then it's a Yellow. On the other hand, if he required assistance or it was really difficult for them, then it's a Red.You can also add for example another metrics like time to perform the task. This metric might be helpful to set the value. For example, if you have run this task several times with different groups you might have a bunch of previous results, so you can assume that a specific task requires about 5 seconds, with this information if some user takes more than 10 seconds to perform it, even if he required no assistance, you might consider him into the Yellow group.Let's say we have an online shopping application. This application has a complex signup funnel as it's trying to gather as much information as possible from the user to give specific recommendations once you signed up, and it also has a shopping tool inside where you pick a product and just buy it.We'll create for our usability test three tasks:Here is where you need to be smart as if you just pick small tasks as select a colour it might be too descriptive to the participant and give him an extra hint, also we don't want to overwhelm them by giving them a big amount of tasks to do.In this case, for example, we'll divide the first task into four sub-tasks. We'll also divide the other two tasks into three and two sub-tasks. It's important to know how much is the granularity we want to achieve from this test.In the following image, we can see the results of the usability test from five different participants, we have it structured in an easy to read way, and we also get the overall result for each participant and for each task. It's important to know that some tasks that are really difficult for some participants can result really easy for another participant. Here is when your persona analysis needs to shine like a sun.From this test, we can easily get the critical tasks to improve are: Fill contact details, Add to cart, and Fill credit card details. As a common pattern, we can also see that we are struggling when the user is required to fill something, maybe it's time to rethink our forms.These results are easily transferable to any stakeholder without any issue, as we can see the report is pretty simple and self-explanatory, you just look for the red sections to see where are the users struggling. It might be even better if we add the time to perform each task.Sometimes we struggle to transfer results from usability tests. This is usually because we don't get quantitative results in a proper way and we rely on qualitative results from our observations.But there are a lot of ways to get easy-to-read reports that can also add some quantitative information to our stakeholders.Hi, I‚Äôm Mariano.

It‚Äôs awkward to ask someone how much they earn or what things cost. We regularly check our bank balance but it‚Äôs not something you would show your friends or family.Therefore, when it comes to negotiating freelance work, we are faced with a topic that we tend to avoid in every day life‚Äîour money. Unfortunately, the scales are also tipped in our clients‚Äô favour, as they usually discuss budgets on a pretty regular basis.So how do you go about negotiating the best rate for your work?1. Work out what you can affordOnce you‚Äôve done this, you‚Äôll know where your limits are. It‚Äôs fine to say you can‚Äôt afford to do the work at a lower rate. You‚Äôll be leaving money on the table if someone else would be paying you more for your time.2. Don‚Äôt spend the moneyDon‚Äôt hypothetically spend the money before you have it. Before you entered the negotiation, you didn‚Äôt have anything. You want to go in like you have nothing to lose.During a negotiation the first number you say makes the biggest impact. From here, the client will automatically want to push you down.From the client‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs a learned behaviour ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quoted a number. If I can negotiate down from it a little, then I‚Äôve got a good deal.‚ÄùOur behaviour is also learned. Most of us currently do this: ‚ÄúI charge between ¬£2,000 and ¬£4,000 for a website‚ÄùTurns out we‚Äôve all been doing this incorrectly this whole time. In this situation the most effective thing to do is to say the biggest number first. This number then becomes your anchor.Try saying: ‚ÄúI charge between ¬£4,000 and ¬£2,000 for a website‚ÄùIt‚Äôs that simple. You now have a higher starting point for your negotiation.If the client gets you down a little bit, they have a good deal and you still land well inside your banding.

Guided Agile and the changing role of the Information Architect,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/guided-agile-and-the-changing-role-of-the-information-architect-1f639f848d6d,Rachel Aliana,264,4,704,"A part of ‚ÄúStructuralism and a Pattern Language for Online Environments‚ÄùIn the past, if a farmer wanted a sweeter strawberry, they needed to search through the strawberries in their field to find one that was sweeter than the others. The next year they would plant their strawberry crop using those seeds, and with each cycle they would get slightly sweeter strawberries. This approach takes a long time, and at the end a farmer would still not be able to say why their strawberries are now sweeter. They just are.This process of doing, measuring, adjusting, and doing again is akin to the process of agile development conducted in businesses today. Agile development is a useful tool to get people to talk to customers, experiment, and shift course quickly. But agile can also be highly inefficient because it can take dozens of iterations to reach a design that works for your given market.Agile development is like a blind-folded archer that locates the target of product-market fit through a game of Marco Polo. They can shoot and adjust quickly, but this experimentation takes a lot of time. They also lose a lot of arrows.The discovery of DNA opened a new realm of exploration through the insight that small base pairs of guanine‚Äìcytosine and adenine‚Äìthymine combine in complex sequences to form different genes. This understanding changed how new fruits and vegetables come to market. Suddenly scientists could understand what genes create sweetness in a strawberry, and use this understanding to engineer sweeter fruits in fewer iterations.Objects and modules are the digital equivalent of the natural world‚Äôs base pairs and genes. The patterns information architects uncover are like the understanding scientists cultivate of how genes are expressed. Understanding interaction patterns can help businesses see why certain website structures fit certain markets, or how adding something small, like a Like or Comment button, can create ripple effects throughout a system.In the archer-playing-Marco-Polo metaphor, this is like a person that knows the target is likely to be on one half of the field rather than the other. This person only needs to make two or three guesses to get to the target instead of five or six. In a business, this is like a design team that creates a great product in the third or fourth iteration instead of the sixth or eighth. They still need to iterate to understand what patterns match their specific circumstances, but their actions are better directed. They aren‚Äôt shooting as blindly.Currently a lot of information architecture work is done unconsiously, hidden in product design, UX Research, and business management. A business person might see people like Tinder, so they make their app with swipe cards. They understand people like Karma on Reddit, so they put these incentives on their websites as well. They might be able to test and redirect their course of action quickly if these things turn out to be bad choices. But since they never understood the underlying architecture, they cannot enunciate why they were unsuccessful and their next iteration is not guaranteed to be more successful.The patterns developed in information architecture are not meant to supersede an agile approach. These patterns are meant to make agile experimentation more efficient by guiding design decisions, making design closer to engineering than intuition.If a company wants to build a place where their users can be vulnerable, information architects know that an important element to create vulnerability is to have clarity in who can access a user‚Äôs information. If a company wants to build a place where work happens, information architects can align what kind of work (research work, editing, or collaborative work) with user permissions. If a company wants to build a community, information architects can understand the community‚Äôs values to see if users should interact primarily in constant streams or separate pools of different discussions.The ideas of objects, blocks, modules, and channels, as well as the Patterns of Work, Play, Education, and Home are the very first steps to make online designs more conscious and effective. This increase in exactness of design will likely make the Information Architect a more valued member within design teams and organizations as they are better able to move from system goals to the design of these systems.",26/07/2019,0,0,0,8,804,648,3,0,0,4,40

Now‚Äôs your chance to show the great work you‚Äôve done and get that role.The in-person portfolio is different from your online portfolio which the interviewers have already seen. This is an opportunity to feature your best work showing how you‚Äôve exceeded objectives given the constraints.Your portfolio will be evaluated from multiple angles. The criteria is broader than the design exercise since you‚Äôll be showing work you‚Äôve done as part of a team. Your interviewers will be interested in seeing the following:Aside from the work you‚Äôll be evaluated on your delivery. Are you able to communicate clearly, present an intriguing story and keep folks engaged during your hour (this is your time)? In the next article we‚Äôll cover techniques to make your speech sparkle.There‚Äôll be a variety of folks who‚Äôll see your presentation:Keep this audience in mind when you‚Äôre practicing.The number one person you‚Äôre building this deck for is yourself. You‚Äôll want to create a modular portfolio that you can remix at a moment‚Äôs notice if you‚Äôre called in for another interview. To help you get there I recommend starting by taking an assessment of your recent work.What were your recent projects that you consider to be your best work that show a variety of skills? Highlight projects that played to your unique identity as a designer ‚Äî your combination of skills, point of view and process that led to a result no other designer could have achieved.One way to put a project stack is to evaluate each project individually on your craft skills such as: user research, interaction design, visual design, and affected platforms.As an example you might have a project where you were heavily involved with customer interviews, solving a complex interaction problem for a desktop app but you were operating within an existing design system so there wasn‚Äôt much visual design work.For another project you were heavily involved in visual design, e.g. you were doing illustration, color, and iconography for a design system that spanned both mobile and desktop platforms.Combining these projects in your portfolio demonstrates that you have strong skills in many areas. These graphs are inspired by You might also consider other project dimensions such as:When you‚Äôre interviewing for multiple roles, I recommend building a deck composed of about 6 projects. You‚Äôll present 2 to 3 projects during your portfolio review and have the other few in your back pocket in case interviewers have additional questions during one on ones.After evaluation it‚Äôs time to tailor the portfolio to the role. You‚Äôll get a good sense of what to include (or exclude), show first, and what to put in the appendix based on the job description. Ideally you get a sense of their underlying needs from the phone interview.Not sure what to show? The recruiter (or a dedicated contact at the company) is your best ally in this process. Don‚Äôt guess, reach out and ask them to describe their ideal candidate and what work they‚Äôd like to see.To make an impactful presentation, turn it into a story.

It‚Äôs so malleable, it can be lightweight (for things like notes and checklists) or for more complex organization (like editorial calendars and product roadmaps). It‚Äôs also totally free with real-time collaboration (so you can view and edit along with others).Here‚Äôs how I harness the power of Notion for my UX/UI and Product Design process.And if you‚Äôre interested in saving yourself a ton of time you can download this entire Notion Template Pack here and copy it into your Notion workspace with just 1-click!designerup.coI usually start out by creating a Workspace for my product or project that includes 7 main sections:‚ú® Inspirationüíº Businessüôã User Researchüï∏ Information Architectureüñ• UIüìä Marketingüõ£ Product RoadmapPro tip: Click the default page icon directly in front of a section or page to change the icon or use (CTRL+COMMAND on Mac to bring up your emoticons menu üôÇ)Pages are built using a combination of what Notion categorizes as Basic Blocks, Databases and Embeds and these can be customized, combined and connected to map your content in unprecedented ways.For the ‚ú®Inspiration Section, I keep things pretty simple by just adding Page Blocks and Text so I can write down my thoughts, brain-dumps and quick notes.Pro-tip: You can add a cover image by clicking on the Cover Image icon and then selecting a default image, uploading your own or inserting something directly from Unsplash.Next up is the üíº Business Section. If I‚Äôm working on a product from scratch or even something handed off to me by a client. I like to use this area to log and organize all of the business objectives, directives and things like company vision and mission. Oftentimes, when I‚Äôm working on designing a new product, this can take the form of a Lean Canvas or full on Business Plan.For a Lean Canvas, I normally use the Toggle Block and add a separate toggle for each section of the canvas:Competitive Analysis is the next page in the business section and I like to use the Gallery Inline Block for this one which allows me to create cards for each competitor, that way I can add stats to each of their cards as I drill down deeper into the analysis.I like grabbing a few images from their website and some of their copy when I‚Äôm in recon mode üòé and adding it to the Gallery Inline Block post so I can get a feel for their brand at a glance.Moving onto the üôãUser Research Section. This area gets a lot of action during the UX process when I‚Äôm busy creating surveys, conducting interviews and trying to make sense of all the data I collect from users. I usually have a separate page for Online research, Surveys, Interview Questions and Personas, but you can include many others depending on your process (such as video embeds for ethnographic studies etc.)I normally kick off project ideation by sending off some basic online and social media polls and surveys to get the general pulse of my audience. So, for the Online Research page, I like to use a Gallery Inline Block so that I can have a card for each platform and jot down things like commonly asked questions I see in Facebook groups or on Quora related to the problem area I‚Äôm researching.A combination of Headings and Toggle List Blocks do nicely to create surveys and manage incoming answers.Good interview questions take some time to craft, so I like to write them down here while referencing my checklist of what goals I want to achieve for the interview and what logic-based questions I want to pivot to based on my participants‚Äô answers. I create a Gallery Inline Block for each participant to keep everything organized and help me create my User Personas later on.Speaking of personas, you can upload those here too so you can share them with your team and start to build the narrative of your users.üï∏ Information Architecture is the next section in my workspace and it‚Äôs an important first step when you‚Äôre getting into the UI phase of the design process. Here I can create a page for my site map and each of the different user and site flows so I can quickly jot them down before moving them into my favorite visualization tool. For those of you who want to know exactly what tools we recommend for this you can find out here.Over in the üñ• UI Section, I collect things like color palettes, style guides or make simple lists of all the UI elements that I will need to style for my interface designs.If you‚Äôve managed to make it this far in your Product Design and UX/UI process well then you might actually have a product to market! In that case, you‚Äôll want to get your content strategy in order and for that I like to use a combination of Gallery Inline Blocks or Table Inline Databases for writing and organizing my posts.You can set the status and filters so you know which ones you‚Äôve published and which ones are drafts, you can also set the author and other parameters:Having done that you can now easily connect these posts to an editorial calendar using the Database Relations Property so you know exactly what to post when!And finally, so you can keep all your efforts on track you can lay down a path in your Product Roadmap with a Kanban board full of milestones and tasks to chart a course to your goals!As you can see Notion is a pretty incredible and powerful tool for Product and UX/UI Designers. The ability to create a workflow that is so tailored to your needs with simple blocks and database connections can increase your productivity and sanity exponentially.If you want to save yourself a ton of time you can get this entire workspace for Notion Workspace for Product Designers here.

The Secret to Becoming Rich is Not To Make It a Goal,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-secret-to-becoming-rich-is-not-to-make-it-a-goal-7df3b445304c,Sylvain Saurel,15900,6,1234,"Many people want to know how to become rich. If you doubt it, just browse the Web to see the incredible number of articles explaining the secrets to get rich. As I visit forums, I increasingly see questions from people asking how they can get rich before they are 30 or 40 years old. In short, it is clear that the subject is fascinating, if not obsessive, for more and more people.Seeing more and more people interested in becoming rich has led me to question myself. Is there a secret to becoming rich? Are there any miracle recipes to apply? Would it be enough to follow the good habits of people who have been very successful in this world to become rich in my turn?I imagine you‚Äôve already asked yourself these questions yourself. If this is the case, you must have started looking for a book on the subject. Indeed, such a general problem has already had to be addressed many times. You probably came across Napoleon Hill‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThink and Grow Rich‚Äù, which is a reference in this field.In this book, Napoleon Hill explains the secret, according to him, to become rich: you must have the firm conviction that you will become rich. Even better, you should think about it in the evening when you go to bed and in the morning when you get up. By applying this method, you will necessarily achieve this famous wealth.All this seemed rather simplistic to you, but since Napoleon Hill is a reference in this field and his books have sold in the millions for several generations, you tried to convince yourself that it was a possible solution. Nevertheless, after a while, maybe a few years, you probably noticed that this obsession with wealth has not made you richer.As you continued your research, you then came across the book of another recognized master in the field of wealth, a certain Robert Kiyosaki. You have therefore read his book ‚ÄúRich Dad, Poor Dad‚Äù in which he highlights the absolute necessity to always privilege the Assets over the Liabilites to become rich. Assets are things that make you money, while liabilities are things that cost you money.If for some of you, this was obvious, others really discovered the basics of personal finance with this book by Robert Kiyosaki. This highly successful book is therefore a great read. Nevertheless, it does not really advance you any further in your desire to become rich. Indeed, you should focus on Assets, but how can you do this if you don‚Äôt have enough Assets?This question is the heart of the matter, but Robert Kiyosaki is not really helping you here.Your long journey to the secrets of wealth may have led you to another well-known book: ‚ÄúSecrets of the Millionaire Mind‚Äù by Harv Eker. This book clearly explains that wealth is defined above all by thought patterns. The models you will unconsciously adopt from an early age will have a decisive impact on your future wealth level.So, from your earliest age, your experiences will define what you can expect later. This raises the following question: are you condemned to never become rich if you have not been able to adopt the right ways of thinking in your youngest age?Fortunately, I would like to say that nothing is definitive. Nevertheless, it is likely that you will leave with a handicap. Indeed, by observing many successful billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page or Elon Musk, you understand very clearly that their minds work differently from the average person.A priori, they do not necessarily have a greater potential than so-called normal people who will never reach the same wealth. However, they have something extra. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs what Harv Eker simply calls the Millionaire Mind.The billionaire entrepreneurs I mentioned earlier all have in common that they see opportunities where others see an obstacle. So when an obstacle presents itself to them, they will address it so that it becomes an opportunity to be seized to succeed. When Elon Musk launched Zip2, which would become PayPal, he had no experience in the banking world. For many, this would have been an insurmountable obstacle. Not for him.He saw in this lack of knowledge of the banking world the possibility of bringing a different vision and a fresh perspective that then became a real opportunity to make things happen. The success of PayPal then confirmed all this. To succeed in transforming an obstacle into an opportunity, it is also necessary to know how to show humility by acknowledging its weaknesses and shortcomings.Some weaknesses can be compensated by work, but others cannot. That‚Äôs when you need to have the intelligence to know how to surround yourself properly. The day Elon Musk wanted to enter the space industry by revolutionizing a previously closed sector, he did not have the necessary knowledge to carry out the mission he had set himself on his own. So he had the intelligence to surround himself with the right people. Among these people is a certain Tom Mueller, an engineer who has always been passionate about space, who enabled Elon Musk to make SpaceX a huge success.Elon Musk‚Äôs example can be applied to Jeff Bezos when he created Amazon or Mark Zuckerberg when he created Facebook. Thus, wealth was not their primary objective at all. That was clearly not their obsession. However, they did have an obsession that pushed them, and still does today, to accomplish great things.This obsession is that of all the great people in this world who have a vision of a problem to solve and are never completely satisfied until that vision has become reality. Wealth always comes second once their vision leads to a concrete reality that benefits many people.If you are not totally convinced by this last statement, all you have to do is take a closer look at the stories of other billionaires such as Bill Gates or Larry Ellison. You will find that wealth has never been their primary objective. Thus, their wealth is simply a consequence of the great things they wanted to accomplish.The proof of this is that once they reach billionaire status, these visionaries continue to do ever greater things! Their ambitions are limitless and they want to revolutionize more and more new fields. This is proof that becoming rich and then being rich is obviously not an end in itself.Becoming rich remains an objective for many people, as I already explained in the preamble. However, I have just shown you also that this is probably not the best way to achieve it. Indeed, people who become rich have most of the time reached this wealth by creating companies that will solve problems that benefit to many people.The problems you need to solve to become rich don‚Äôt necessarily have to be as ambitious as Jeff Bezos‚Äô conquest of Mars. In fact, you just have to solve the problem of ten thousand people who are willing to pay $100 for it in order to become a millionaire. Nothing insurmountable a priori.The secret to becoming rich is therefore not to make it an objective. Instead, have the ambition to do great things and solve problems. If you achieve your goals, wealth will come on its own. In your quest to accomplish great things, never forget that you will have playing to win in life rather than playing to avoid losing.This will make all the difference!",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,879,551,4,0,0,4,94

Here in this post we are going to see how we can create a job which runs in a particular day and time to delete the blobs we have in a blob containers in our Azure Storage Account. If you want to know how you can upload to the blobs using Azure Function, consider reading my article here.As we are going to inject our dependency via constructor we need to configure the same by creating a Startup.cs class in our solution. Let‚Äôs do that first. To configure, make sure that you had installed the Nuget Package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.Now create a new class and name it as Startup.cs and write the code as preceding.Here we are adding a singleton service for our IBlobService. Do not forget to inherit your Startup class from FunctionsStartup.As we have set up our Startup class, now let us create our Azure Function. Follow this post to see how you can create one. And you can write the code as preceding.Here we are making the Function to run on every Monday at 4 AM using the CRON expression. Make sure to check my previous post to see more about the CRON expression.Below are the blob container names I have in my Azure Blob Storage.Make sure to use the small letters for your Azure Blob Container names, otherwise you will see an exception as mentioned here.Now let us create a new Interface for our service.And then create a service BlobService.Here you can see that in the PerformTasks function we are getting the blob container reference and then get all the blobs using ListBlobsSegmentedAsync and then cast it as ICloudBlob so that we can easily delete the blobs.Make sure to add the AzureWebJobsStorage in your local.settings.json file and in the Azure Function Configuration in the portal.Feel free to check this article on my blog here.Wow!.

The Way to Get Rich Quick is to Do It Slowly,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-way-to-get-rich-quick-is-to-do-it-slowly-3d102cfbea9d,Kyle O'Hagan,12,6,1275,"If it‚Äôs too good to be true, don‚Äôt trust it. Rather, run as far away from it as you can. I get it ‚Äî It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of a get rich quick scheme when the offer sounds too tantalizing and promising to refuse. But, almost always, these schemes are a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing.They look innocent on the outside, but the core of the scheme is misleading, deceiving and almost always manipulating your emotions. They promise great returns with little risk, going against typical investment dogma. However, before you know it, you‚Äôre neck-deep and losing half of your life savings.So, how do you know what to believe as trustworthy? Well, read on and, hopefully, I can answer that question for you. But, first, I want to give you 2 excellent examples of get rich quick schemes that have taken the world by storm in the recent past.Does anyone remember the Bitcoin hype of 2017? In a matter of months, the price of Bitcoin increased over 1,500%. Those who had bought a single (or several) Bitcoin for $1 in 2011 were celebrating when the price skyrocketed to an all-time high of $19,783 in mid-December 2017.However, the exponential rise in Bitcoin was short-lived. By early February of 2018, the price had dropped to below $6,000 ‚Äî a drop of over 70%. It has since been termed the ‚Äúcrypto crash‚Äù.But what exactly is Bitcoin? Take a look at this video to get a better idea:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4&feature=youtu.beBlame human psychology. Very few people are investing in Bitcoin because they consider it the ‚Äúcurrency of the future‚Äù. Rather, most tend to invest because of the hype surrounding it. Have you ever heard the saying: ‚ÄúGet one to go and they will all go‚Äù? We‚Äôre often a bunch of sheep being herded by our emotions.And, like most investment bubbles, the fuel that drove most people to invest in Bitcoin was the soaring rise in its price. Very few people understood what Bitcoin was, but they came in droves to give up their hard-earned money to invest in a currency that had previously been associated with black market drug deals. But, who cared? You could get rich quick, right?Unfortunately, most people learned the hard way that Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt as secure a goldmine as they thought. There are stories of people having lost their entire life savings because of it.But don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre alone if you got sucked in. Even personal finance bloggers, like myself, got enamored by the hysteria. When November 2017 rolled around, I was watching the Bitcoin price more closely than I was my actual bank balance. And, yes, in case you were wondering, I did lose a little money as a result.The next get rich quick scheme is one that is a little more sneaky. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of a Ponzi or pyramid scheme before in the news, but do you actually know how it works?Essentially, the pyramid schemer devises an investment offer with outrageous and mouth-watering returns. This is done to attract a set of initial investors. Once the initial investors commit, the schemer pays them what they were promised. Word spreads like wildfire that the initial investors received their promised returns. As a result, hoards of new investors rush in to hand over their money to get their piece of the pie.However, what the new investors are unaware of is that the schemer uses their money to fund the high returns of earlier investors. As a result, promised returns are always reliant on new investors coming on board. The moment the new investors dry up so does the scheme. It can be catastrophic when new investors get excited about seeing their returns and invest all their life savings into the scheme, only for the scheme to fall apart.In fact, a recent situation in South Africa used the hype of Bitcoin and the strategy of a pyramid scheme to lure people into a disastrous investment. Some investors even took out bank loans to buy into the scheme. I‚Äôll let you read how the story ended.It may sound counterintuitive. But it‚Äôs true. The way to get rich quick is to do it slowly. Because there aren‚Äôt any get rich quick schemes that actually work.An interesting article was recently published on Moneyweb, by Patrick Cairns, which spoke of different scenarios in which investors tried to time the market. This is often used to better their performance ‚Äî or, in other words, get rich quick.‚ÄúJust missing the single best day of performance over these 24 years would mean that an investor would see only 92.8% of the return. That is a substantial reduction for missing just one trading period out of the 6 000-odd days in this sample ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut on the flip side, suppose you could avoid the worst day, your portfolio would have been 13% better,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf you missed the worst five days you would have 53% more and missing the worst 10 days would mean you would have 110% greater.‚ÄùEssentially, what this article is saying is that getting rich is a long game and there‚Äôs no point in trying to predict or create shortcuts. There‚Äôs a great investment quote that usually does the rounds: it‚Äôs not about timing the market, but rather the market.This is not only restricted to investing. The same could be said for all aspects of our personal finance journey. Whether it relates to your side hustle, job promotion, budgeting journey or savings for retirement, realize that you‚Äôre running a marathon, not a sprint. To get rich by any of these means takes time, patience, persistence, and perspective.J.D. Roth, a contributor to Forbes, calls this the Get Rich Slowly philosophy, that I believe have incredibly valuable nuggets of wisdom.Related: Becoming Buffet: 10 Things You Need to Consider as a Beginner InvestorWarren Buffet has been quoted as saying: ‚ÄúNever invest in a business you cannot understand.‚Äù To that, he added that when he is considering an investment, he places it into one of three boxes: in, out or too hard. Almost all of his investment decisions land up in the ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù box. Because let‚Äôs be honest, you cannot understand every investment opportunity out there. And Buffet is willing to accept that. He sticks with and puts his money into opportunities that he understands.Given that Buffet is a multi-billionaire, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that he knows what he‚Äôs talking about. This affirms the fact that if you don‚Äôt understand where your money is going, then don‚Äôt put your money there in the first place.As I mentioned earlier, so many people funneled their money into Bitcoin with little understanding about what it was, how the price was affected, how to keep their money secure, and the tell tale signs of an investment bubble.If you want to invest your future in a unit trust or company or currency or side job, do the research and find out all you can about it. Find out whether the opportunity meets your standards, morals, ethics, goals, and time horizon. If anything sounds too good to be true, walk away. If anything confuses you, walk away. And if anything does both, definitely walk away.In this day and age, it‚Äôs so easy to fall prey to the greedy, who suck you into investments and ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù that you just can‚Äôt refuse. I encourage you to always question them by asking:Do you know of any get rich quick schemes that others have tried to persuade you to join? Or do you have any questions that you ask yourself before making an investment?

Deploying a static website: GatsbyJS to AWS S3 (and more),The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/deploying-a-static-website-gatsbyjs-to-aws-s3-and-more-a1c496527576,Nate Park,70,13,2153,"Today, deploying a personal website is easier than ever. There are hosting websites such as Wix, SquareSpace, Shopify, and many more. However, we have to pay a fixed price and it is not automatically scalable. For example, if you built a portfolio just for your potential employers, you may feel like even the basic plan can be too expensive.Amazon Web Service (AWS) is perfect in this situation. It is scalable, and you only pay what you use. If no one visits the website (hopefully not), you pay nothing. As an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I would like to introduce you to how to deploy your website using AWS resources step by step.Before writing this blog, I also went through a lot of trouble to successfully deploy my website (by the way, you are always welcome to check out my portfolio website! ‚Äî www.thedevelopark.com). I saw numerous articles and blogs about deploying instruction. In this blog, I combined all of them into one, and also, I wanted to share with you about some unexpected situation that I had to figure out on my own.For anyone who is not familiar with AWS, but interested in learning, I recommend taking courses instead of following instructions like this.*UPDATE (July 31, 2019)* Emiliano Gabrielli gave me awesome feedback about hosting a website in a more secure way ‚Äî (Emiliano‚Äôs Article). The updates are written under 4. Amazon CloudFront. There are two updated sections. The updates are added in the way that you don‚Äôt need to delete and recreate anything.S3 bucket is one of the ways to host a website. But it is only compatible with a static website that doesn‚Äôt require server-side technologies.First, create a bucket with a name. It must be unique because S3 bucket name is shared globally. If you have owned domain, it is better to have the bucket name to be the domain name.Going through step by step, while leaving everything as it is (default settings), the only section we need to change is the tab 3, ‚ÄòSet permission‚Äô. Uncheck ‚ÄòBlock all public access‚Äô, otherwise, people will not be able to visit your website.Once created, click the bucket row. It will toggle the bucket information. Click ‚ÄòCopy Bucket ARN‚Äô.Now let‚Äôs go into the bucket by clicking the text exactly. For me, it is ‚Äòthedevelopark.com‚Äô.Then, click ‚ÄòPermissions‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòBucket Policy‚Äô.Our Bucket policy editor is empty because the bucket is newly created. Mostly, other similar blogs should have the same policy as mine, but for guide purpose, let‚Äôs generate one!There are four red circles that we need to change unless AWS Service is not Amazon S3.First Circle ‚Äî Select Type of Policy ‚Üí S3 Bucket Policy.Second Circle ‚Äî Principal ‚Üí *Third Circle ‚Äî Actions ‚Üí GetObjectForth Circle ‚Äî ARN ‚Üí paste what we previously copied, then (IMPORTANT) add /* at the end. /* gives access to the contents inside of the bucket.‚Üí Click ‚ÄòAdd Statement‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòGenerate Policy‚Äô. In the end, it will return the Policy as JSON format.In generated policy, note that the Action has an array. If only one action, we can remove the array. Also, if you want to just copy policy, make sure to change the 'Resource' to yours.Copy the generated policy and paste to the empty Bucket policy editor.It will give a warning when we save. We can ignore it.Two more steps to go!Now, our bucket needs some contents to show visitors.Go to ‚ÄòOverview tab‚Äô (it is located along with the ‚ÄòPermissions‚Äô tab) ‚Üí click ‚ÄòUpload‚Äô. Then DRAG your contents. ‚ÄòAdd files‚Äô does not know how to handle folders.Click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô ‚Üí under ‚Äò2. Set permissions‚Äô, find ‚ÄòManage public permissions‚Äô, change to ‚ÄòGrant public read access to this object(s)‚Äô ‚Üí choose Standard (free tier).For the last step, allow the bucket to host a website with the uploaded contents.Go to ‚ÄòProperties‚Äô tab ‚Üí click ‚ÄòStatic website hosting‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòUse this bucket to host a website‚Äô ‚Üí put down index.html and 404.html if applicable. ‚Üí Save. Done.IMPORTANT!The ‚ÄòEndpoint‚Äô is your website address based on the S3 bucket. It will not work because we are using GatsbyJS. Your index.html is located in the public directory and S3 bucket can only find what is in the root directory.To solve this issue, we need a ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù in between your code and S3 bucket. A ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù that can take theindex.html file out from the public directory so the bucket can successfully host your website. There are several options and it purely depends on your preference.For readers who decided to use Travis CI:However, before going over each one, IAM setup needs to be setup. Just like we push our code to GitHub, we can use our CLI to upload the files to the S3 bucket ‚Äî (AWS documentation for CLI configuration).The command I used is:In words:From the root directory, synchronize files in the public directory to S3 bucket called, ‚Äòthedevelopark.com‚Äô. Lastly,--delete will delete files that are in the destination, in this case, the S3 bucket. To learn more about this command, you can check out ‚Äî (Synchronizing AWS S3 ‚Äî an Overview).Now, back to IAM.Without the IAM permission setup, access to the bucket will be denied. This is because the S3 bucket only allows public access for GetObject action, nothing else. You can allow more actions through configuring S3 bucket policy, but it is safer to use IAM service for the security matter.AWS documentation provides great instruction on how to set up ‚Äî (Policy Setup). In the page, we will see four topics. We can check the first two.If you decided to manually type in commands, then read the first topic. Otherwise, go directly to the second topic.Next is AWS CodePipeline. It is a must-have AWS resource that automates the deployment process (Continous Delivery). For example, when you push changes to GitHub, AWS CodePipeline detects the change and triggers the process to upload the changes to the connect S3 bucket.Let‚Äôs create a pipeline! There are 5 steps:Step 1: Go to CodePipeline from the console ‚Üí click ‚ÄòCreate pipeline‚Äô ‚Üí create pipeline name (e.g. my-website-project) ‚Üí choose Service role ‚Üí click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.Service RoleStep 2: Choose GitHub for your source ‚Üí connect your GitHub and choose the right repository ‚Üí choose branch ‚Üí select GitHub webhooks (selected by default) ‚Üí click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.Step 3: If you are using AWS CodeBuild, stay. Otherwise, skip to step 4. Choose AWS CodeBuild for Build provider ‚Üí click ‚Äòcreate project‚Äô (a new window will pop-up.The New window:‚Üí Type in ‚ÄòProject name‚Äô ‚Üí select ‚ÄòManaged image‚Äô, then a new section will show up ‚Üí choose ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô for Runtime ‚Üí choose ‚Äòstandard:2.0‚Äô for Image ‚Üí leave the rest as they are and find ‚ÄòService role‚Äô ‚Üí select ‚ÄòExisting service role‚Äô ‚Üí find the role that we created.‚Üí Leave the rest as default. I recommend CloudWatch logs to be checked in case of a failure ‚Üí click ‚ÄòContinue to CodePipeline‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.Step 4:Choose ‚ÄòAmazon S3‚Äô for provider ‚Üí make sure your Region is the same as the S3 bucket‚Äôs region ‚Üí find the bucket and choose ‚Üí check ‚ÄòExtract file before deploy‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô.Step 5: Review the steps and click ‚ÄòCreate Pipeline‚Äô. We will have something like this (If you created AWS CodeBuild, there should be ‚ÄòBuild‚Äô stage between ‚ÄòSource‚Äô and ‚ÄòDeploy‚Äô).From now on, when you make changes to your code and push to the GitHub, AWS CodePipeline will detect the change and automatically upload the code to the S3 bucket.For AWS CodeBuild users only, we are not done! For users who prefer manual way, skip this part.We need to provide buildspec.yml as an instruction for AWS CodeBuild.First, here is the AWS documentation for buildspec.yml ‚Äî (Build Specification Reference for CodeBuild). This should give you some understanding of it.Also, here are some examples:Option A:Option B:In words: First, delete all files in S3 bucket ‚Üí create a new directory called build-output ‚Üí move all files that are in public directory to build-output directory ‚Üí delete everything except build-output ‚Üí move all files that are in build-output ‚Üí then delete build-output.However, ‚ÄòOption B‚Äô is not a successful example because it only keeps files that are in the public directory and deletes the rest (Gastsby files).Purpose of examples is to show you that there are many different ways to command your AWS CodeBuild to process deployment. I am also having trouble succeeding in the CodeBuild process (My question on StackOverflow).Once all process is successful, your S3 bucket should be updated.For Manually typing users, after creating AWS CodePipeline, in your terminal, type in following commands:Unless your website requires constant change, then I recommend the manual way.That is it! Go to your S3 bucket and click the bucket ‚ÄòEndpoint‚Äô. Your website should be up and running.Now you may be realized, we only have the S3 bucket Endpoint for your website address and it is not looking pretty.We can purchase a domain through Amazon Route 53‚Äôs Domain Name Service (DNS) and request Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates through AWS Certificate Manager.To connect your domain to the S3 bucket, Amazon CloudFront will handle everything.Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. ‚Äî AWSGo to CloudFront from AWS console ‚Üí click ‚ÄòCreate Distribution‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòGet Started‚Äô under ‚ÄòWeb‚Äô section.Find and choose your S3 bucket in ‚ÄòOrigin Domain Name‚Äô ‚Üí Find ‚ÄòViewer Protocol Policy‚Äô and select ‚ÄòRedirect HTTP to HTTPS‚Äô.*UPDATE* To make your website more secure, I added extra steps. We will restrict bucket access (and update S3 bucket after).Check ‚ÄòYes‚Äô for ‚ÄòRestrict Bucket Access‚Äô, then more options will appear ‚Üí choose ‚ÄòOrigin Access Identity‚Äô. If you are ‚Äòcreating‚Äô, the name is automatically created. ‚Üí check ‚ÄòYes, Update Bucket Policy‚Äô for ‚ÄòGrant Read Permissions on Bucket‚Äô.‚Üí If you want to customize Time to Live (TTL), cache expiration time, select ‚ÄòCustomize‚Äô from ‚ÄòObject Caching‚Äô and change TTL, otherwise, skip ‚Üí check ‚ÄòYes‚Äô for ‚ÄòCompress Objects Automatically‚Äô.‚Üí Find ‚ÄòAlternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)‚Äô, put down your purchased domain name both with and without ‚Äòwww‚Äô ‚Üí select ‚ÄòCustom SSL Certificate‚Äô ‚Üí choose the certificate created from AWS Certificate Manager.‚Üí Input ‚Äòindex.html‚Äô in ‚ÄòDefault Root Object‚Äô ‚Üí write your domain name on ‚ÄòComment‚Äô (optional) ‚Üí Done! It is going to take some time to create the distribution.Now, we should have another domain name that looks like ‚Äòaoiwenf3oisfj.cloudfront.net‚Äô. If it leads to your website, it means the CloudFront distribution is successful.If you have and 404 page, we can lead visitors to pre-made ‚Äò404‚Äô page by creating a custom error response.*UPDATE* Now that CloudFront is all set, let‚Äôs go back to S3 bucket and secure it.First, Disable ‚ÄòStatic website hosting‚Äô.Now that we have CloudFront has its own domain name along with your purchased domain, we no longer need the Endpoint.Second, Enable ‚ÄòBlock all public access‚ÄôWe can block all public access, but it is still accessible through CloudFront.In order for CloudFront to access the bucket, we need to update the ‚ÄòBucket Policy‚Äô.Notice that the policy is different from what we originally created (the red rectangle is added). It is because when we were creating the CloudFront distribution, we checked ‚ÄòYes, Update Bucket Policy‚Äô for ‚ÄòGrant Read Permissions on Bucket‚Äô.If we compare, every key has the same values except ‚ÄúPrincipal‚Äù. Instead of *, it is something about ‚ÄòCloudFront Origin Access Identity‚Äô.Go to CloudFront ‚Üí click the ID, ‚Üí go to ‚ÄòOrigins and Origin Groups‚Äô tab. You will see the ‚ÄòOrigin Access Identity‚Äô.Now, delete the original policy, and add a new one.New above Element is added. The two elements are very similar except ‚Äòred‚Äô and ‚Äòorange‚Äô underlines. Make sure the check (also comma between elements!).Your website is now secured!Now, it is time to connect and redirect all services to your domain name.Since you purchased a domain name, there should be 1 Hosted zone created already. Going into ‚ÄòHosted zones‚Äô and click the domain, you will see the following two types are already created with values that start with ‚Äòns‚Äô.If you accidentally deleted the hosted zone, you can always recreate it and match the values by editing.Now, let‚Äôs create type ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚ÄòCNAME‚Äô Record set to connect the domain name to CloudFront domain.Leave the ‚ÄòName‚Äô empty ‚Üí choose type ‚ÄòA‚Äô ‚Üí write your CloudFront domain name (ao3rijrojnsd8.cloudfront.net) in ‚ÄòValue‚Äô ‚Üí click Create.‚Üí Write ‚Äòwww‚Äô in ‚ÄòName‚Äô ‚Üí choose ‚ÄòCNAME‚Äô for ‚ÄòType‚Äô ‚Üí write your CloudFront domain in ‚ÄòValue‚Äô ‚Üí click ‚ÄòCreate‚Äô.Now we have your website properly published!My knowledge of AWS is still basic and I am very excited to continue this path to become a professional AWS developer.AWS provides many different resources to host your websites such as AWS Amplify, AWS Elastic BeanStalk, Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), and more. There are hundreds of blogs, articles, and videos that guide you on how to do. If you are thinking of running a startup, even if you are already, I really recommend learning more about AWS. It is truly interesting and also potentially will help you grow faster.",26/07/2019,3,3,121,12,966,600,31,7,0,18,158
A Guide to Java thread dump analysis API,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/a-guide-to-java-thread-dump-analysis-api-45b7116a3590,Ram Lakshmanan,165,8,692,"In this modern world, thread dumps are still analyzed in a tedious & manual mode i.e., you have to get hold of DevOps team, ask them to send you the thread dumps, then they will mail you the thread dumps, then you will upload the dumps in to a thread dump analysis tool, then you have to apply your intelligence to analyze it. There is no programmatic way to analyze thread dumps in a proactive manner. Thus to eliminate this hassle, fastthread.io is introducing a RESTful API to analyze thread dumps. With one line of CURL command, you can get your thread dumps analyzed instantly.Here are a few use cases where this API can be extremely useful.Most of the DevOps invokes a simple Http ping or APM tools to monitor the applications health. This ping is good to detect whether application is alive or not. APM tools are great at informing that application‚Äôs CPU spiked up by ‚Äòx%‚Äô, memory utilization increased by ‚Äòy%‚Äô, response time dropped by ‚Äòz‚Äô milliseconds. It won‚Äôt inform what caused the CPU to spike up, what caused memory utilization to increase, what caused the response time to degrade. If you can configure Cron job to capture thread dumps/GC logs on a periodic interval and invoke our REST API, we apply our intelligent patterns & machine learning algorithms to instantly identify the root cause of the problem.Advantage 1: Whenever these sort of production problem happens, because of the heat of the moment, DevOps team recycles the servers with out capturing the thread dumps and GC logs. You need to capture thread dumps and GC logs at the moment when problem is happening, in order to diagnose the problem. In this new strategy you don‚Äôt have to worry about it, because your cron job is capturing thread dumps/GC logs on a periodic intervals and invoking the REST API, all your thread dumps/GC Logs are archived in our servers.Advantage 2: Unlike APM tools which claims to add less than 3% of overhead, where as in reality it adds multiple folds, beauty of this strategy is: It doesn‚Äôt add any overhead (or negligible overhead). Because entire analysis of the thread dumps/GCeasy are done on our servers and not on your production servers..When you conduct performance tests, you might want to take thread dumps/GC logs on a periodic basis and get it analyzed through the API. In case if thread count goes beyond a threshold or if too many threads are WAITING or if any threads are BLOCKED for a prolonged period or lock isn‚Äôt getting released or frequent full GC activities happening or GC pause time exceeds thresholds, it needs to get the visibility right then and there. It should be analyzed before code hits the production. In such circumstance this API will become very handy.As part of continuous integration it‚Äôs highly encouraged to execute performance tests. Thread dumps/GC Logs should be captured and it can be analyzed using the API. If API reports any problems, then build can be failed.

14 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Being A Freelancer,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/14-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-started-being-a-freelancer-6d647ba00b9f,Enywaru Pius,688,9,1920,"Being a freelancer was the proverbial world that I really thought everyone was missing out on. I dreamt of & admired the ease with which one would become so successful at just being their own boss. The number of success stories that were littered on the interwebs made me fall in love with freelancing even more.A few years down the road of freelancing, I now realize it is not all rosy like it was painted by the people that were in the freelancing world for a long time. Until I entered the world of ‚Äòbeing your own boss‚Äô and ‚Äúworking at your own time & pace‚Äù, I was gullible enough to think it was such a smooth ride.When I chose to be a freelancer years ago, I wish someone had sat me down and told me of the hiccups and things that I will face along my journey so that I could at least prepare myself or never venture down that road at all. It‚Äôs at this moment in my life that I realize that the countless success stories of different freelancers that I read were incomplete and left out an important detail ‚Äî the real hustle that‚Äôs deeply rooted in freelancing.These are some of the lessons I have learned along the way and I know more complex ones will come along but I know for sure they will find me well aware and prepared. The following are to guide whoever may be interested in walking the freelancing road one day and are only looking at the good things. (It‚Äôs okay to have a positive mind but don‚Äôt lose sight of the truth).When I finally made up my mind that I would be saying goodbye to a 9‚Äì5 hustle and I‚Äôd be going into a world where I don‚Äôt have to wake up early in the morning to go to work, I asked a few freelancers how I would go about it and no one seemed to have a straightforward answer. I also failed to learn the fact that everyone I asked was simply trying to tell me ‚Äòenter the hustle and see for yourself‚Äô.I was only interested in hearing the ‚Äòsimple lifestyle‚Äô that freelancers enjoy and thought I would simply go online and get work. Well, I was in for a shocker. I later realized that it was way beyond just saying I am a freelancer and work comes to you. You will have to put in the hard work, the extra push and effort to establish yourself. Let no one lie to you that they have the blueprint of ‚ÄòHow to be a Freelancer‚Äô because it takes a lot more than just being told what it takes.If you really think things are going to work out pretty fast for you, then you are in for a shocker. The freelance world will strongly test your patience and isn‚Äôt for the faint-hearted. You are going to have to sacrifice a lot, throw in the extra work before things start going great for you. There are some people that are really lucky and don‚Äôt have to wait for long to start reaping big but that is a rare one. You will need a lot of planning, practice & patience to welcome the good results.Every creative, blogger, photographer and just about anyone in a freelance hustle knows how easy it is to get carried away and forget your work because you‚Äôre watching ‚Äòjust one episode‚Äù of Money Heist Season 3. If you are not about to work on the things that rob you of your attention and productivity, then the procrastination cancer is slowly going to eat you up and this will affect your work.It‚Äôs a normal thing to procrastinate but there has to be a high self-drive if you are to get any work done. Remember the more you extend, the less time you have and you‚Äôll find yourself doing wack work.If you thought your boss was annoying, then you haven‚Äôt seen the contractors that normally work with Freelancers. The freelance world is one with many bosses that you will have to put up with on a daily basis. Some will be nice to you while others will be bluntly arrogant and because the bills have to be paid, you‚Äôll have to coil your tail and bear with them. If you are short-tempered, you are going to have to work on your anger to survive and most importantly, be polite enough.There‚Äôs so much time on your hands, you choose your schedule and everything somehow revolves around you. However, don‚Äôt be deluded to think that you can do whatever the hell you want. The freelance world is like that of a farmer if he doesn‚Äôt go out to work at the farm & cultivate, there won‚Äôt be any produce at the time of harvest.Likewise, if you don‚Äôt go out of your way and look for work, pitch ideas, create networks, do the work that is before you, you will starve. If you must stay afloat, you will need to strive at whatever it is you do.Everyone seems to be complaining about how they are tired of a 9‚Äì5 daily and if they were presented with a choice, they‚Äôd gladly welcome a freelance life. Well, are you ready for a 24/7 hustle?.The thing no one told me is that even if you are grabbing a beer on a Friday afternoon, a client will call you at any time and ask for their work, ask for changes to a particular design, ask for a skype call. Your work schedule when you are a freelancer won‚Äôt know a weekend, a weekday or a public holiday. Be sure to know that anytime is work time when you are a freelancer.Regardless of being a Freelancer, you are going to have to treat your work in the same way that professionals do whether you want it or not. You are going to have to draw up some rules for yourself to follow and you will have to abide by them.If you are to ever succeed at whatever it is that you do, you will have to obtain the highest degree of self-discipline and no one will be around you to remind you. You can either kill 8 hours watching a few series on Netflix or actually get some work done. It‚Äôs your choice to make.Remember that your next paycheck is not entirely guaranteed or may not come at the time that you would love it too. One thing you should carry with you to the freelance world is a high degree of financial discipline. If controlling your spending is a struggle, be aware of how it‚Äôs holding you back from achieving your money objective.Cutting unnecessary expenses & proper planning is the key to living below your means, so you have plenty of money left over each month to reach your financial dreams. I wish someone told me this first.Every client you get may not be as patient as others or may just fail to connect with you and this may create a bad relationship. If a client doesn‚Äôt like your work, they may never refer you or may leave a bad rating for you online.Remember you only got one shot when you are a freelancer and that it the attitude you should always carry with you. When I get to work, I make sure I do it to the satisfaction of the client and when I learn that it wasn‚Äôt to their satisfaction, I sometimes offer to do the other piece of work for free to keep a healthy relationshipAs a freelancer, it‚Äôs normally the more you work, the more you earn. When I started out as a freelancer, I was hungry for work and I always found myself taking on gigs even when I still had unfinished work before me. I wanted to make myself busier and busier so that I could earn more and more money and grow my craft. Whereas it was a good thing for the first months, I later found myself fatigued, failing to beat deadlines, my results were not the best and I lost a number of clients because of this.I learned that as an Individual, you can only do so much. Simply take one a sizable amount of gigs you can handle and produce quality work for your clients and maintain a neat portfolio.Freelancers in most cases are everything, the admin, the CEO, finance manager, the HR, the salesperson, the designers, the workers, name it. Surely all these roles will make you feel like you are a robot. No, You‚Äôre not. You need to slow down, you need to take a break from work before you start dishing out obsolete ideas, creating crappy work and washing away your productivity.Whether you want it or not, you need to take a break from your hustle and revitalize yourself.I almost gave up. Nothing was making sense, clients weren‚Äôt paying on time, some bluntly refused to pay and there were months when there was no work at all. No one told me these moments will come and how I would go about them. It‚Äôs easy to give up when you are a freelancer especially when you feel stagnated and you have nowhere to run so as to seek solace.However, you are going to have to keep your head up and keep moving, rethink your choices, your hustles, re-activate your networks and do everything there is to stay afloat. Every when you find yourself in a state of no motivation, remember, you‚Äôre your own motivation.There are people that are going to try and pull you down, shit on your hustle & discredit whatever it is that you do. They are going to come along and make your life a living hell and at some point, you are going to feel worthless and contemplate on where to carry on or not.You know what? Pay them a deaf ear and a blind eye if you are to carry on with your hustle.No one ever told me that the freelance world is more like survival for the fittest and every bottle sits on its bottom. You are on your own out here and you are going to have to do whatever it takes to keep at the top of your game. Remember whoever tries to bring you down is simply scared of how good you are.This is the most important & hard lesson that I have learned that often sang but had never really sunk in. As a freelancer, to be able to distinguish yourself from the sea of other freelancers, you need to be extremely good at what you do and you also need to know your worth.You are going to meet clients who will bluntly want to give you peanuts for your work and if you can‚Äôt firmly stand your ground and say NO or simply walk away, it is going to be hard for you to grow in your hustle. It will also get somewhat hard when there are no gigs and you will be pushed to the corner & you‚Äôll find yourself settling for less. It‚Äôs important that if you follow some of the lessons above, it will be easy for you to always have a firm grip on your worth.About the AuthorPius Enywaru is a Content Writer for Technology, 4IR, Freelancing, Life Lessons.

5 Best Alternatives to Google Play Store Every Developer Must Know and Target,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/5-best-alternatives-to-google-play-store-every-developer-must-know-cf3ae7d551c1,Sylvain Saurel,15900,7,1404,"As all Android mobile application developers will tell you, the Google Play Store is the entry point for anyone who wants to generate substantial revenue from their applications and games. Indeed, the Google Play Store has the advantage of being installed by default on almost all Android smartphones in the world. There is a very simple reason to that. Indeed, for having the Android license issued by Google, smartphone manufacturers must highlight the Google Play Store on their devices.With this monopoly position, the Google Play Store can now boast more than 2.7 million applications for Android users. Thus, many developers only focus on the Google Play Store when they publish their applications or games. This can be a mistake. Indeed, it is very difficult to stand out from the crowd when your application or game is lost in an ocean of applications.Even the best ASO strategies in the world will not be enough in most cases. Thus, it often happens that developers publish excellent applications but that they remain unknown to the general public. Of course, this results in an obvious loss of revenue for these developers.Under these conditions, it seems important to remind these developers that if the Google Play Store is the mandatory point of passage, there are other application stores for Android that can allow them to enjoy a great success. In addition, these blinds have the advantage of offering users fewer applications, which makes it easier for them to be noticed as well. My advice is therefore simple: as a developer, you should not hesitate to publish your application or your Android game on several application stores in order to maximize your chances of generating revenue.To this end, I present you the 5 best alternatives to Google Play Store every developer must know and target.The Android application store of online retail giant Amazon was launched in March 2011. It is accessible in more than 200 countries, which is no small feat. Based on the model chosen by Google or Apple, Amazon pays 70% of the selling price of applications or in-app purchases to developers. At the end of the first quarter of 2019, the Amazon Appstore lists just over 475K applications.Amazon‚Äôs application store thus offers almost 6 times fewer applications for download than Google‚Äôs. This gives you a better chance of being noticed. On a personal level, I have noticed that the Amazon Appstore works particularly well for games. So, if you develop games under Android, the Amazon Appstore is a must. Users of this store are very fond of games and it is no coincidence that major studios like Rovio have chosen to publish some of their games on the Amazon Appstore.You probably know that Samsung is the world‚Äôs leading seller of smartphones. However, do you know exactly how many Samsung smartphones are sold each year? By looking at the graph below, you will discover that Samsung has been selling more than 70 million smartphones per quarter for more than 6 years now!This figure is simply colossal. Even better, most of Samsung smartphones run on Android. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, I have better news for you as a mobile application developer. Samsung offers its own application store on all its Android smartphones: the Samsung Galaxy Store.Launched in September 2009, the Samsung Galaxy Store offers significantly fewer applications than the Google Play Store because many developers do not even think about publishing their games and applications there. By making the effort to publish your application on the Samsung Galaxy Store, you will already have an advantage over your competitors.Besides, the Samsung Galaxy Store offers a huge advantage over other Android application stores. Indeed, the team in charge of validating published applications performs real functional tests on the Samsung smartphones you target when publishing an application or a game. These quick functional tests are performed taking into account the functionalities you describe for your application.After these quick functional tests, the validation team can reject your application. The good news is that it will provide you with a complete report on the reasons for this rejection with possibly screenshots of the problem, see a video or even better dumps of the logs of the target smartphone on which the application to crash. This is something quite amazing for a mobile application developer who doesn‚Äôt have a big budget to spend on testing on a wide range of smartphones. For this reason alone, you should publish your applications and games on the Samsung Galaxy Store.Finally, Samsung often highlights applications and games on its store, which will allow you to quickly win users for your creations.Aptoide is a special Android application store because, unlike the Google Play Store, it does not offer a single, centralized application store. Instead, each user will be able to manage his own application store. Thus, Aptoide is generally presented as an application marketplace software allowing the installation of mobile applications on mobile systems running Android.Anyway, Aptoide is the largest independent Android application store. More than 1 million applications are available for download, which can take away the benefit of greater visibility for developers. Nevertheless, other advantages should be considered with Aptoide, for example with a potential target of more than 200 million users worldwide. Its independence also allows it to propose innovations frequently to better highlight the work of developers. Thus, the company behind Aptoide launched AppCoins its own cryptomonnaie with the aim of disrupting the Android application awning market via the Blockchain.AppCoins can be used by users to buy applications or make in-app purchases in applications published on Aptoide. This is something very promising and for that reason alone, every developer must try the Aptoide adventure in my opinion.The Opera Mobile Store was launched in March 2011 as a platform-independent browser-based app store for mobile-phone owners and a digital application distribution platform. The application store is used by more than 40K developers around the world, which clearly shows that it is easier to make a place for yourself. In addition, it is widely used in some African and Asian countries, which can allow you to reach a new target with your applications and games.The Opera Mobile Store also allows you to link to your application on the Google Play Store directly from the application published on its store. So you can also consider a publication on the Opera Mobile Store as a solution to make your application better known on the Google Play Store. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt cost much to publish your application on this additional store. So, make it!SlideMe is an independent Android application store that highlights the work of independent developers like Aptoide. Nevertheless, SlideMe‚Äôs approach is somewhat different since SlideMe has a very selective process before accepting a new application on its store. Thus, SlideMe states that more than 60% of the requests published on its store are rejected.This difficulty to enter the SlideMe store can be seen in two different ways. At first glance, you may think that it is not necessarily worth making the effort to try to be selected if the percentage of rejections is so high. On the other hand, you can see this as an opportunity by telling yourself that because of this high rejection rate, if you pass the selection process, your application or game will be better highlighted among the just 30K applications offered to SlideMe users.SlideMe therefore remains to be considered for any Android application developer.As an extra bonus, I would like to mention F-Droid which is the free application store for Android open source applications and deserves to be supported because the initiative is great. If you want to publish an open source Android mobile application, you should publish it on F-Droid to gain visibility.As a mobile application developer, your work is not just about creating great applications or games. This is only part of your work. Indeed, if you want to generate revenue with your applications and games, you will have to reach as many users as possible. To do this, you will have to work on the ASO part of course but also promote your work.However, a part too often overlooked by developers is maximizing the exposure of their applications by publishing them on application stores other than the Google Play Store. In this sense, I hope that this article will have enlightened you on the need to also target the 5 other major Android application stores on the market.",25/07/2019,1,0,0,0,721,458,3,0,0,2,99
How to Develop Unwavering Confidence,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-develop-unwavering-confidence-775477d5f5ef,Adrian Drew,13600,7,1397,"Confidence is critical. It‚Äôs an essential ingredient of happiness, an unequivocal component of success and the one thing that stands between us and the person we wish to become.Whatever we hope to achieve in our lives, be it a promotion or self-mastery, it all comes back to the same question. How confident are we in our abilities?Without self-assurance, we become too attached to our own dignity, anxious in any situation that might threaten it. And so we avoid any situation in which we might face embarrassment ‚Äî which is, frankly, almost every situation.We decide against applying for our dream job because we think we‚Äôll be rejected. We shy away from making the first move in new relationships. We keep our mouths closed instead of voicing our opinion. Above all, we suppress our desire to be free. To be ourselves.It follows, therefore, that it is in all of our best interests to become as confident as we possibly can. But how?To quote The School of Life,‚ÄòAt the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be.‚ÄôThe problem is that we‚Äôre too busy telling ourselves stories. We‚Äôre so lost in our own heads and our thoughts that our view of reality becomes grossly distorted.Picture yourself in a board room meeting amongst several of your colleagues. After listening quietly for twenty minutes, your boss turns to you and asks, ‚ÄòWhat do you think?‚ÄôSuddenly, you‚Äôre spiraling downwards into self-conscious anxiety, too afraid to open your mouth to voice your opinion.You stutter, stammer, stumble upon your words and resort to saying something you don‚Äôt really mean just to fill the silence and get yourself out of the spotlight.The problem? You‚Äôre telling yourself a story ‚Äî that everybody is listening to you, scrutinising you and thinking that you‚Äôre talking complete nonsense.Your mind overflows with ideas about what should and shouldn‚Äôt be and you‚Äôre left incapable of truly being yourself.On the flip side, imagine being in a room full of young children teaching them basic maths skills. Chances are, you‚Äôre pretty relaxed.You aren‚Äôt hyper-aware of their perception of you, and you aren‚Äôt so self-conscious that you can‚Äôt formulate a coherent sentence.Your stories are entirely different. In scenario B, you feel competent. Superior. Grounded. In your head, you‚Äôre not worried or anxious but confident in your own abilities. And in scenario A, you‚Äôre a mess.Start noticing when you‚Äôre telling yourself stories. It‚Äôs those stories that dictate the way you act, and when they‚Äôre negative, your ability to be true to yourself is compromised.Unhinging yourself from the stories you‚Äôve been telling yourself is one of the most important steps you can take towards becoming your most confident self.I remember being a young child at school and delivering my first presentation to the class. Standing with a group of my friends in front of all of my peers, it was my turn to speak.Before long, I started to become aware that all eyes were on me. Everybody in the room would notice if I messed up.The nerves kicked in. I stuttered. Stammered. Stumbled upon a couple of words.A few giggles came from the back of the room, humoured by my embarrassment which only grew worse. My breathing quickened and my knees started to shake. I sat back down feeling ashamed and humiliated.As a result, I spent the next fifteen years of my life deeply afraid of public speaking. It all started in that classroom.Psychology teaches us that most of our fears begin this way. We experience something traumatic and start to associate those feelings with a particular situation or object, like flying, socialising or big hairy spiders.Whether we can remember such occasions or not, these fears persist until we convince our brain otherwise. In theory, we‚Äôll go on being afraid for as long as we continue to avoid the phobic object in question.Low confidence is, in essence, a phobia. It‚Äôs a phobia that takes many forms depending upon the situation we find ourselves in, examples of which include:Whatever guise it takes, all of these fears come back to the same essential fear: that we, for whatever reason, are not good enough ‚Äî good enough to deserve praise, acceptance, success or love.And, as we‚Äôve already confirmed, the only way to dissolve fear is to confront it. In doing so, we rewire our neural circuitry, retraining our brain and teaching it that that which we have learned to fear is, in fact, not worthy of our anxiety.My phobia of public speaking lasted for many years. For each year that I avoided talking to audiences, my anxieties only intensified until I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer.Since starting secondary school at thirteen years old, I‚Äôd wanted to become the leader of my house team by the time I reached my final year in education.Being a house leader which would involve speaking to large crowds of students and hosting the annual competitions that took place between each house.At thirteen, I was nowhere near confident ‚Äòenough‚Äô to become an ambassador for my house, but I reasoned that once I reached eighteen I‚Äôd be ready.Each year that passed, I was surprised that I wasn‚Äôt becoming increasingly more confident. Despite my hopes, nothing seemed to be changing.Alas, I still didn‚Äôt feel ready when the time finally came for me to apply to join the house team. I was just the same as I was back in my first year, just older and a little taller.I was disappointed that, after all of those years, that long-awaited self-esteem had never arrived. And that‚Äôs when it hit me.No matter how much you hope, pray and wait patiently, you‚Äôll never feel confident enough to do the things that scare you.You gain confidence after you face that which you‚Äôre afraid of; after you put yourself in a position in which you might be rejected, humiliated, lonely or fail ‚Äî but never before.Every single time you confront your fear, you gain a little more courage to do so again in the future.When you face your phobias again and again, you gradually start to realize that there‚Äôs no need to be afraid. This isn‚Äôt a life-or-death situation, and you can handle a little embarrassment or rejection from time to time.To make that realization, however, there‚Äôs a hurdle to overcome. You have to put yourself in some pretty uncomfortable situations. You have to become well-acquainted with fear.Each time you confront your self-limiting beliefs, you stand to be humiliated. You‚Äôre not practicing avoiding rejection. Rather, you‚Äôre getting good at not worrying so much about what other people think of you.The risk of trying and failing removes the sting from the tail of embarrassment.Actually confronting our fears, however, is easier said than done. Since I was thirteen, I‚Äôve been making a conscious effort to do just about everything that scares me (although I‚Äôm yet to bathe in dinner-plate-sized tarantulas.)I talk to strangers all of the time and have put myself in some pretty embarrassing situations, like lying down on the floor in a supermarket full of people.From my experiences, I‚Äôve found that doing scary things usually comes down to one thing: the three-second rule.The moment that you consider doing something frightful, you start doubting yourself. Your brain almost immediately starts firing off excuses and reasons why you absolutely shouldn‚Äôt face your phobia.After around three seconds, if you haven‚Äôt done the scary thing yet, you‚Äôre probably not going to do it.By that point, your mind has already convinced you that the prospect of humiliation is so devastatingly awful that you‚Äôd better run away while you still can.The trick, therefore, is to face your fear within that three-second window.Let me provide some examples of scary situations that, when confronted, can work to improve confidence:Of course, there are plenty of ways in which you can confront your fear of rejection ‚Äî these are just three that I‚Äôve practiced a lot.It‚Äôs crucial that you remember one thing: it doesn‚Äôt matter if you mess up, if you get nervous or if you face crippling embarrassment. What matters is that you just go ahead and face the thing that‚Äôs holding you back.Then, and only then, can you start building true and long-lasting confidence in your own abilities.I run a daily newsletter The Daily Grind where I send out tips to creatives and entrepreneurs about success, wellbeing, goal-setting and honing their craft.If that sounds like you, follow this link to sign up.",25/07/2019,1,0,12,6,1050,699,1,2,0,11,255

Libra ‚â† Blockchain,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/libra-blockchain-b5424870c8b6,Dan Roseman,121,7,1104,"The Libra ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù is a unique database system, but it is not a blockchain.A blockchain is a distributed ledger containing a growing list of records (transactions) that are batched in blocks which are linked together using cryptography.

It is described as a ‚Äúcryptographically authenticated database.‚Äù From the Libra whitepaper:Unlike previous blockchains, which view the blockchain as a collection of blocks of transactions, the Libra Blockchain is a single data structure that records the history of transactions and states over time. This implementation simplifies the work of applications accessing the blockchain, allowing them to read any data from any point in time and verify the integrity of that data using a unified framework.There are six players in the Libra ecosystem:The Libra ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù is permissioned. Validators are restricted to a certain set of Organizations known as the Libra Association that satisfy a set of requirements (including a $10M investment required to operate a Validator node). The Libra Association is currently comprised of 28 Organizations representing the following industries:Traditional blockchains generally utilize one of three consensus algorithms:Of the three algorithms, Libra is most closely related to DPoS with three key differences:While the Libra ledger will initially be permissioned, the project aspires to transition to a permissionless system by migrating to a Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture whereby Libra Users would receive voting rights proportional to the amount of Libra Coins they control:While this method of assessing validator eligibility is an improvement on traditional permissioned blockchains, which usually form a set of closed business relationships, we aspire to make the Libra Blockchain fully permissionless. To do this, we plan to gradually transition to a proof-of-stake system where validators are assigned voting rights proportional to the number of Libra coins they hold.If Libra achieves a permanent transition to a permissionless Proof of Stake architecture, only then might it be considered a real blockchain.To understand why this all matters, it helps to appreciate why Satoshi Nakamoto invented the blockchain in the first place. The very first sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper states:A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.Satoshi‚Äôs goal was to bring privacy to digital payments by porting the offline cash experience into an online environment and replacing centralized intermediaries (Banks, PayPal, etc.) with a decentralized network of Miners. Satoshi saw the permissioned nature and reversibility of centralized payment systems as an inherent weakness of the trust-based model that these systems rely on. As explained in the Bitcoin whitepaper:Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.Libra is a payment system centralized around the Libra Association; it relies on Users‚Äô trust in the Libra Association that Validators will process transactions with neutrality and maintain sufficiently powerful hardware and secure environments for transaction processing. In terms of Libra Coin, Users must trust the Libra Association to adequately allocate assets in the Libra Reserve to protect Libra Coin‚Äôs stability. Per the Libra Blockchain whitepaper:As the value of Libra is effectively linked to a basket of fiat currencies, from the point of view of any specific currency, there will be fluctuations in the value of Libra. The makeup of the reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of these fluctuations, particularly in the negative direction (e.g., even in economic crises). To that end, the basket has been structured with capital preservation and liquidity in mind.Not only that, Users must trust Authorized Resellers to not disrupt asset balances within the Libra Reserve. From the Libra Blockchain whitepaper:Users do not directly interface with the reserve. Instead, to support higher efficiency, there are authorized resellers who are the only entities authorized by the association to transact large amounts of fiat and Libra in and out of the reserve. These authorized resellers integrate into exchanges and other institutions that buy and sell cryptocurrencies and provide these entities with liquidity for users who wish to convert from cash to Libra and back again.By contrast, traditional blockchains rely on math underpinning the cryptography upon which they are built and cryptoeconomics to incentivize miners to continue creating blocks ‚Äî a system that has been working remarkably well for over a decade.Satoshi Nakamoto invented the concept of a blockchain to enable secure online peer-to-peer payments without a trusted centralized intermediary. Governments today are actively working to remove cash from circulation in an effort to transition to a completely digital financial system under the guise of national security; on November 8, 2016 the Prime Minister of India gave only four hours‚Äô notice before abruptly removing 86% of rupees from circulation.Libra is not built on a blockchain; while it does share some similar technical attributes of a blockchain (such as a Merkle Tree) it can more accurately be described as a private, cryptographically authenticated database. Libra relies on a trust-based model where Users must trust the Libra Association to:Users must also trust Authorized Resellers to not disrupt asset balances in the Libra Reserve. Maintaining equilibrium in the Libra Reserve will be a novel challenge, and Users will have to take a leap of faith to trust the Libra Association and Authorized Resellers to act as a Fiduciary to protect the liquidity and stability of Libra Coin.",25/07/2019,0,0,20,0,830,308,4,6,0,11,89
The Grief Manual: Fear,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-grief-manual-fear-56053bef0462,Sarah Tomolonius,43,13,3313,"Being an adult, feeling helplessDestabilizing death can make the world seem intrinsically random and stuffed with the boogeymen of bad chance. My sister, Hannah, died, and as I continue the story of my life wrest from what I thought it would be, her loss is both about heartbreak and fear. Fear grabs us from behind and forces us to dance rapidly but delicately on the knife blade. Fear is that line of fire marching from mid-abdomen up to our solar plexus. Fear is that feeling of the whole lower stomach being flooded with opaque, bottomless water that endlessly flows from us and out of our sides.Fear is the prickling rising that feeds on itself. It‚Äôs the loop-de-loop that says we are unsettled and ungrounded. It‚Äôs perversely the stuck feeling like we‚Äôre whirling round and round, gaining speed as our feet run the hamster wheel and our hands frantically grasp for something to hold onto as we swoosh and whir. Or maybe it‚Äôs the Gravitron carnival ride which spins like a twirled mixing bowl, and when the floor drops out, the centrifugal force plasters us to the side of the wall. We are unable to peel our fingers or arms off the wall, or if we can, it‚Äôs only for a second before they are splatted back against the wall. We can‚Äôt even move our head to look at our friend to our other side. I like that ride better when there is no ceiling, and you can see the sky. The other version is where there is a dark, low roof. The door is locked on you, and you are then trapped and nailed to the wall, suspended without footing, in semi-darkness. Both are dizzying and disorienting, but at least one posits a way out.I can‚Äôt remember the magnitude of the diffuse or discrete fear I felt before Hannah died. I do know after she died, my concrete foundation shattered on her unexpected death, and fear bloomed in places I had thought were secure. Though there are so many fears, here, I am talking about fear of something horrific happening to someone else I love.Fate is a fickle lover. Mercurial chance manifests itself when a random meeting, a missed phone call, a quick redirection into a different store, a decision to fly out at a different time or to take a different road home can upend and demarcate a different life. But, then, there was a deliveryman who was riding his bike through the park where I used to live who was killed when flooding from a storm three years earlier had unseated the roots of a tree which fell on him at the exact time he was taking a regular route back. It can be easy to think there are no coves of protection from wicked misfortune. Life becomes sequentially random chances.No escape from tragedyI had always thought my family was insulated, that really bad things I saw in the world around me would just ‚Äúnever happen to our family.‚Äù It was a secret ‚Äî in retrospect, probably nastily prideful ‚Äî assumption I had as I watched true crime reenactments on TV as a child, as I read upsetting news articles and as I saw tragedy cast through the world around me. I think I even mentally rehearsed that when I babysat for my then little brother and sister at night, and my parents didn‚Äôt come home at the time they‚Äôd predicted. I‚Äôd wait up anxiously in the dark night, afraid they had died in a car crash, but such a thing never came to pass and probably further stiffened my belief that we were somehow impervious to extreme tragedy. In spite of my worries, we were safe.I didn‚Äôt think that meant we would be Teflon to sadness, heartbreak, financial issues or to struggles to find and right ourselves as we grew and to the inevitable illnesses and death we would see as we all aged. I had seen my first open casket funeral at aged three. I had watched my maternal grandmother slink into her skeleton over an agonizing two years because of lung cancer and die when I was nine. I had witnessed the drenching turbulence of alcoholism and mental illness during my childhood. I had started an AIDS Awareness group in my junior high school in response to the carnage from the disease affecting family friends. I still thought, however, that we ‚Äî my immediate family ‚Äî would never be directly afflicted by the kind of chaotic agitation of too-young car crash deaths or gun shot deaths that would threaten to upend the stability I always saw baked into our normal, generally well-thought of, handsome middle-class family.We were beset by the typical life issues that people have, but it seemed impossible that we wouldn‚Äôt all have long lives, if we took reasonably good care of our health. Even after my father‚Äôs quintuple bypass a decade ago, he prided himself on having blood pressure that was better than his children who were runners. We would or could somehow weather the storms. There were certainly scares and close-calls, but before Hannah died, my essential intuition about people and the world was met in reality. Nothing had really surprised me before; I seemed to anticipate how the stories would play out, within a narrow band of error.Two things I know now after Hannah died is that the threat of danger feels closer and more real and that I can now see a lot more loss throughout everyone else‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal, generally well-thought of‚Äù families than I had before. This person here‚Äôs or that friend there‚Äôs child or grandchild died of suicide or a heart defect or drugs or a car crash, like my parents‚Äô friend who leaned into my ear and whispered he knew, he really knew, what I was going through. His own brother had died young. And then another friend told me the same thing and another and another and another until it felt like the tight knitting that I‚Äôd been wrapped in before Hannah died was an illusion or a fabrication. Hannah died, the wrap around me unknotted, and I suddenly saw all the spaces in the unraveled yarn that contained the truth about our human experience.When babies, children and adults die outside of what feels like the long amount of time they should have truly been prescribed, it feels searing and wrong. I am not saying that death is the only form of tragedy that upends. For others, it may be violence to or other traumas and sicknesses of the body or the bodies close to you. It is truly anything that frightens you awake into the broader reality that life is not just some stylistic materialism or some journey you embark on and complete alone.Life is not judged by the rapid accumulation of product, good or currency. Or maybe it is in the moments, but the sum of our final experience is usually whittled down to the impact of our personality, our words and our deeds. There are anecdotes about great people‚Äôs acts that defined life for the rest of us, but by and large, as my old accounting professor always noted, ‚ÄúYou are not Warren Buffett.‚Äù Even he likely wants to be remembered as much or more for his 99% Giving Pledge of donating his monies to charity and encouraging other wealthy people to do the same with at least 50% of their wealth. Some of us are born with this innate understanding about the fundamentals of life. We may live lives seemingly unmolested by jeopardy but still see the world through congenitally open eyes. Others of us must pass through the rift of heart-thrashing trauma to ‚Äúearn‚Äù that clarity.Maybe I‚Äôve been too myopic. It‚Äôs not that our family wasn‚Äôt beset with tragedy, it‚Äôs just that I was enwombed from it directly before Hannah‚Äôs death. My paternal grandmother is one of two children, but her older brother died when she was just old enough to call his nickname, ‚ÄúJunior.‚Äù My great-grandmother, Nanny, lived through the flooding heartache of her five-year-old son‚Äôs death with the repeating calls of ‚ÄúJunior, Junior‚Äù from her toddler daughter who was seeking to find her lost brother, her mother‚Äôs first and only son. My grandmother said her mother later told her she had seen a man with a black top hat pass through their hallway when Junior was dying, and many years later, Nanny saw a photograph of her husband‚Äôs late father, the same image of the man in the top hat she had seen as her son lay dying. Death comes upon death, and the dead ferry the just-dead to some beyond.Nanny‚Äôs first and second husbands also predeceased her, and she lived into her 90‚Äôs, helping to raise her three grandsons with her daughter and son-in-law. I remember her when she lived on her own in her later years with the same kind of little yellow parakeet my grandmother told me Nanny had when she was younger. When I was there, Nanny would open the cage and let that bird flit and rest anywhere it pleased in her small, open, sunny apartment.My grandmother does not remember her brother except from stories Nanny told her, and of course, I never met my great-uncle who never even cascaded into his full childhood. But, he was present with us from the time I was little. My grandmother always recalled the story her mother told her of her calling his name, the story in which she continued to call his name. Now, I call his name. Even so, I have only just tied up together the twinning tragedies of the early loss of my father‚Äôs uncle with the loss of my daughter‚Äôs and her cousins‚Äô aunt, Hannah. My daughter and her cousin remember Hannah and suffer the direct loss. This is the streaming loss of children and of parts of our family as our hopes of some natural, better order of things fall away.The pathThere are other tragedies in our family. Even if we feel we are protected, we are still the bearers of great historical, familial and personal suffering, through which each of us must find and carve our own path. This is the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism: suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering and the path to the end of suffering. Some believe the streaming run of karma flows from prior lives and builds in this life. They believe that manifesting, ‚Äúripening‚Äù karma explodes, unfolds or leaks now or soon and also accrues to the next lives. What to do? There are guides, texts, ways of posture and breath, but there is no one answer. What is the way out of fear? We must confront that ourselves.Perhaps that imprecise and wanting answer is also why bereavement or grief advice can feel like just another blowhorn from the self-help book section. It‚Äôs some soapbox charlatan next to all the others hawking the newest tweaks to fad dieting, to finding exquisite true love, to buying distressed real estate to make millions, to suppressing or overcoming ‚Äî or the newest hot word, ‚Äúembracing‚Äù ‚Äî your mousiness, your fear of public speaking, your fear of commitment or your fear of death. Those advisors want to tell you there is a way through pain to goodness, from wretchedness to righteousness. We hand our crumpled dollars over to the man gliding his hand over the capped potions lining the inside of his trench coat, fearing we are being swindled but so badly needing the cure. I want the treatment to work, but I also want to throw down the potion ‚Äî is it snake oil? ‚Äî and yell, ‚ÄúBut, why is she dead?‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy God, what does your fate hold for the rest of us?‚ÄùReading these books doesn‚Äôt change what happened. It doesn‚Äôt sew together the wide wound that hurts from the current pain and aches in tandem with the prior hurts: ours, our families, our friends. It is at times like these that I wonder if the absence of devotion to a singular belief puts me at a disadvantage. Instead of falling into the well-worn pages of words, mantras or songs that have been the constant throughout my lifetime of trials and tribulations, I am still a seeker. But, then, I think in some ways ‚Äî and according to the plethora of books, courses, retreats and other purported aiding functions to help us through this ‚Äî we all are.Walking along the same sidewalk last week that my sister, brother and I used to take back home from the town pool when my parents‚Äô home was in town, my daughter told me we each have a spirit journey, and some of us ‚Äî like Hannah, she said ‚Äî do not complete our spirit journey here. ‚ÄúWhat happens to those of us who do not complete that journey?‚Äù, I asked her. She told me that they become spirit guides for the rest of us, and that each of us have spirit guides on our journey. It may be that this sagacious wisdom was gleaned from the movie Balto, but I‚Äôll take it where I can get it: from the mouth of a five year old processing life and the death of her beloved aunt through an Amblin cartoon based on the Siberian husky who helped get a diphtheria antitoxin through treacherous conditions from Anchorage to Nome to save children almost one-hundred years ago.I am walking my daughter this summer the same way and in the same places that I walked my sister and that I walked myself throughout my childhood. I am reliving the joy of my daughter‚Äôs awakening visibility into the world, the way I did with Hannah (as my young self was experiencing the same). But, instead of the full possibility of Hannah‚Äôs life that I saw before her ‚Äî and Hannah bloomed magnificently in ways I could not have imagined when she was so young ‚Äî I also see Hannah‚Äôs cut, truncated life. That breach was not one I imagined or foretold for Hannah, and therein lies my fear for my daughter. It has happened; Hannah‚Äôs death has happened. But, the truth of the story ‚Äî and the root of my so-present fear ‚Äî is that the possibility was always there, and it‚Äôs there for all of us. The good is there. The wonder is there. The chance is there.The general guide to the path for each of us is that we can‚Äôt ‚Äî or we shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî encourage stopping too long to consider that fault that is built into our lives like a loose trapdoor that may swing down and take us with it, or like buried landmines, scattered unknown under our feet. For, what are we to do? Stop walking, stop planting, stop building? Stop loving, stop caring? In processing my anger from Hannah‚Äôs death, I wondered if anger is productive and whether when we talk about anger, we actually mean fuel. I wonder the same thing about fear. Maybe fear fuels us in order to stimulate us forward in a more honest, more aware way. After we have seen and heard great death or trauma, life is unfair and frightening, but it is still precious indeed.The wheel of fortuneKnowing the more unfortunate outcomes of life are possible and real because they have happened in our own lives and in the lives of those we love is scary, if not terrifying. But, unchecked fear run amok is as crippling as any other emotion that speeds ahead and runs around, tying us in knots. When I stand in sweating, stagnating fear that runs from my head to my feet and around again, mentally like an injured and now boxed-in hawk slamming its talons and wings into the cage to try to release itself, I must consider the simple gratitude of my breath, my daughter‚Äôs grey-brown eyes and the great pleasure that has been my fate to have been put so close to Hannah.When I remember, like today when I was driving, that Hannah is truly dead, the striking pain thwacks me down with a ferocity and speed that I still ‚Äî all these months later ‚Äî am startled by. Of course, I am shocked because of how knitted Hannah is to me, how stitched together we are in our similar mannerisms, the glint of our eyes, the ways our faces took similar shape as we got older. We are sisters. I didn‚Äôt have to search far to see myself in Hannah, to find her in me, the way I see my smile in my daughter‚Äôs smile or recognize the way her mouth turns as my mouth turns, and I know what she‚Äôs thinking. Then, fear is of the ego, as my unanticipated but now realized fear for Hannah is my fear for my daughter, for others I love and for myself.Again, what am I to do? What comes to pass will come to pass. I ferociously protect where I can and make the very best decisions I can, but I ultimately can‚Äôt control the spinning wheel of chance and the equally exciting and nauseating sound of its flapper getting slower. The wheel threatens to stop on an outcome I don‚Äôt want. But, there are also both wildly and mildly positive wedges the flapper can stop on, and still ‚Äî if you can excuse the hackneyed metaphor here ‚Äî either way, I have to play.Hannah played almost as though she knew she had to pack it in tightly for a too-short turn. Hannah made friends with an innumerable set of people in every facet of every industry, every age group, every background. Hannah dressed up and mastered the art of designing her face makeup and hair as though a chameleon who needed to sample every hue, every micro-deviation in color. Hannah imprinted her skin with her stories to ensure that she and other people saw and understood who she was, reinforcing her story the way my daughter asks again and again for the same stories about herself and our family ‚Äî the same way Hannah, my brother and I asked our parents and each other to tell our stories ‚Äî to drive into our memory who we are and from where we came.And, still, I call and call to her. I call to her the way Nanny must have called to her dead son, as my grandmother called to her dead brother, Junior. I call to Hannah because Hannah is the sum of her personality, her words and her deeds here. I call to her because Hannah‚Äôs death is not her defining moment, it is only her tragic last moment. I call to her because when I am closer to Hannah, I carry her with me, and she carries through in me. I call to her to open myself to being one of the lucky vessels to shepherd the wonderful elements of Hannah. We vessels must foster and nourish the possibilities that she carried but could not realize, like harvesting the seeded tops of the wild sun-bleached grasses that dance with the saffron-petaled black-eyed Susans in the twilight fields near my parents‚Äô house.I call to Hannah to confront my fear of losing her and to stand up to my fear of the terrors that could befall those I love. I call to her to mentally encase the dark blue rippling water ‚Äî that I imagine flows from my womb out through my sides ‚Äî in a clear, open plexiglass container with a diving board atop it. Not so that I can dive into my contained fears but to hold myself above them, to bear witness to the endless chaos that is and can be our emotions and our earthly traumas and to stand removed from them so I have a wider vista of the greater possibilities that are here, still, within our reach.",25/07/2019,0,0,5,2,1050,787,1,0,0,0,52

How To Maintain Privacy When Big Brother is Watching You,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-maintain-privacy-when-big-brother-is-watching-you-b85a36646721,"Christyl Rivers, Phd.",3900,7,1508,"These days, surveillance has become a regular feature of modern commerce. If you are in a startup, or almost any business yourself, you probably can‚Äôt avoid it entirely. Information, after all, seems to be the currency of our techie times.But professionally, and personally, there are those times and places, where you really want to protect your privacy. It is not just the government who collects and stores tons of personal data, but of course, credit card companies, and these days, almost anyone with a product to push.While you go about your daily life, all kinds of Big and little brothers, are out there mining all your data. It‚Äôs enough to make you move to a private island and unplug, but of course, only the miners that got in on the ground floor of mining are rich enough to do that.There is plenty to do to upgrade security, and companies are happy to get your business doing just that. For security and encryption, investigate Senrio, Cisco, HPE, Lynx, and Symantec to names just a few.Before you shell out the big bucks, It is easier, by far, to just watch yourself.The first rule, as always, is to know where you are, what you are doing, and who can see it. Post and text only what you would want the whole world to know about. Sex tapes are a bad idea, as are hateful diatribes. For professional contacts and content, this is a bit harder.At home, put a sticker over the center camera of your screen. Mine has a simple World Wildlife Fund tiger cub sticker staring back at me as I type every day. There are also plenty of retailers willing to sell you fancier ones you can look into if you really can make the time. Such masks are also available for phones and other devices, and they can be as fancy as you like, depending upon how much you wish to spend.A few people also put their phones in the microwave oven, (Turned OFF microwave, for those of you not yet familiar with how electricity works!) I think this is what Kelly Anne Conway was thinking of when she lamented about our microwaves spying on us, but she got it, surprisingly(?) completely backwards.When a device in muffled in a microwave, or similar such box, the microphone, and, also the camera, are obviously disabled. It would not be considered a good hiding place when the FBI shows up, however. If that occurs, I can only ask: What on Earth have you been up to?Joking aside, encryption is only useful when the message itself is in transit. Security is end to end only. Remember that if you are seen; where you put info, and what information you send, there is coding and garbling, but if the device itself (hence the microwave raiding by FBI) falls into the hands of someone you didn‚Äôt choose, that‚Äôs another story.Rule one, then, is always keep any messages, pictures, embarrassing texts, confidential professional work, and private personal data, to an absolute minimum.Most people will at some point drop their guard and put something stupid out there.However, if you don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúpublic you‚Äù to be born, use protection.There are apps that offer some protection, compare end to end encryption products to customize what you wish to protect the most. Some worth looking into are Signal Private Messenger. Look into products offered by Open Whisper, and do your homework on apps through WhatsApp and iMessage. Doing some research is necessary because these features can be customized, and there is no telling what may, or may not be, released, seized, or most commonly, monetized by the parent company.The degrees to which data is being used changes every day. It is exhausting to try to keep up with all the constant applications and their features, which is why rule one is still the best option out there for protection of the individual.Governments can not look out for your privacy. Recent events concerning whether tech giants like Huawei present a huge security risk, is just one example. This indicates you can never be sure when there is a definite espionage risk, even from your own government.When governments spy, it is not necessarily to gain your purchase history for profit, but to keep an eye on other nations and their potentially rich data. Russian interference with the 2016 election displayed that when someone can get hold of your personal information feed, they can easily plant false information to sway opinions, purchases, and votes.Many people today begin their online life with an avatar, or an alias. This is especially necessary for people who are vulnerable to hate speech, trolling, and personal attacks. Reporters and writers have a right to protect themselves through an alias, or pen name. Thy also have an obligation to protect sources, and those people who are in contact with them, who usually wish to remain anonymous.Think about a group in Hong Kong, for example, fighting for democracy and and seeking aright for public assembly without threat of state oppression. Or, think about someone working to fight against major world polluters and profiteers who wish to shut down climate crisis protestors. Everyday people need to contact others in their group, but it is hard to do so given the amount of surveillance today.Whether you think of Edward Snow, or Julian Assange, as good spy, or bad spy, you need to know that while you research, someone is collecting research material on you, as well.There are lesser causes, and personalities also, of course. People have as many different reasons to protect themselves from over surveillance as there are people on the internet.Activists who are up against political enemies have a duty to make sure a worthy, and lawfully, respectable cause, is protected. This means too, that they must also guard all the data generated within it.Watching Stranger Things the other day, I was amused by the code names, Scoops Troop, and Bald Eagle, the agent names chosen respectively for the children‚Äôs crusade against all powers of evil (plus cold war Russians) and the adults who worked as allies of the children.Names don‚Äôt have to be cute spy names, they can also be fun and memorable assets to your business and interests.Once you choose one, however, it is best not to create a million more.Passwords, of course, are also code names. It is best to come up with one that you universally know, and that is a kind of master key for your computer itself. For myself, I prefer passwords that are a combination of letters and numbers, and that are the first letters in favorite works of fiction, or poetry.For example, Shall I compare thee to a summer‚Äôs day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.Becomes SICTTASD?, or the second line: TAMLAMT. Add a number at the beginning, middle, or end, and you have a near perfect code, unless you broadcast all over the place your favorite lines in bars and supermarkets. (don‚Äôt do that, people will think you pretentious as well as easy to read). When you have a password don‚Äôt share it and don‚Äôt change it because you will find it‚Äôs all too easy to get buried under a ton of former, and useless, codes.Think of your vulnerabilities, and also think of how to follow the money spent on tracking you. That is, stay vigilant as to who is responding to your posts. When you realize that people are looking for one of two things, your contacts, or your content, you can make efforts to follow what you leave, and even learn how not to leave it.A trail of breadcrumbs will not hide you very well unless you keep a dog not far behind you that eats them up. It‚Äôs more effective to not put yourself out there unnecessarily in the first place.As with most enormous forces, Big Brother is powerful, and surveillance is everywhere. Just be mindful of it, know that your Facebook time, Twitter, Instagram, and more can track you day to day. For the most part, it is your buying interests and history, that is pursued.If you are on genealogy sites, you might eventually wish to make your DNA information somewhat public. Sites like 23andMe, will allow you to find biological relatives, but at a cost you must carefully consider. My husband and I submitted our DNA sample to one such service. We have had no nefarious consequences at all. However, that doesn‚Äôt prove that some, non-approved of entity, will not track our DNA, in the future for purposes we cannot even imagine.It must also be kept in mind that releasing genealogical data may be used by some to test the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of their racial profile, and thereby, sadly some sites attract racists and hate groups.

Prepare for SCA,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/accepting-european-card-payments-prepare-for-sca-29b5986802f6,Ismayil Khayredinov,278,5,813,"Strong Customer Authentication is a new EU regulation as part of the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that comes into effect on September 14, 2019. After this date payments made from European bank cards online will have to be authenticated with some form of second-factor mechanism, i.e. 3D Secure. This basically is a farewell to synchronous online payments ‚Äî we are going back to PayPal era with IPNs and webhooks.Checkout flow that does not support 3D Secure will see high rates of card declines from EU‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbasically people can no longer checkout by simply providing their card details. Every transaction will have to be validated via issuing bank‚Äôs interface. In my case, my bank uses the default MasterCard 3D Secure window, where I need to input a security code I receive via SMS. A friend has reported he had to actually login into his online banking and approve the payment from within.I am keen on online safety and secure payments, but this is bound to create a lot of frustration among shoppers and sellers, and above all us developers.I am updating a payment workflow on a client‚Äôs site as we speak, and it took me some time to wrap my head around it. Let me explain what needs to happen in layman‚Äôs terms. My project uses Stripe, so I will illustrate based on Stripe API. Check out Stripe docs for more.The synchronous checkout flow, we are used to, thanks to Stripe Charges:Server: Hey, dude, you owe me money.Client: Yep, no problem, here are my card details.Server: Cool, thanks. Got the payment. Shipping your stuff.The new asynchronous checkout flow looks like pain in the butt in comparison:Server: Hey, dude, you owe me money.Client: Yep, no problem, here are my card details.Server: Cool, thanks. Got the card details. I can‚Äôt really charge your card without you confirming to your bank that my charge is legit. I have created a pending transaction, you need to follow this link and verify the payment.Client: Dude, you suck, but I really want my stuff, so I will go do that. Hang tight.Silence. Client is gone dealing with their online banking to figure out how to verify the payment. After what seemed like an eternity of session-expiring proportions, the client comes back.Client: Hey, dude, did you receive the confirmation?Server (best case scenario): Yep, just got it. Shipping your stuff.So, what does this mean in technical terms? If you are dealing with EU customers, you can forget about Stripe Charges API, you MUST start using Payment Intents API.How do you go about it? There are two options on Stripe: with Automatic and Manual confirmation.Automatic confirmation is suitable for situations, when you know the final amount payable, i.e. you have generated an invoice server side, AND you can pass data to your client, i.e. you need to mount Stripe elements knowing the payment intent‚Äôs client secret, AND you are willing to implement webhook listeners.Some possible scenarios for automatic confirmation:Well, as you can imagine, this is not very suitable for most use cases. Implementing webhook listeners is not something every project wants‚Äî that was the beauty of Charges API. That‚Äôs when manual confirmation comes into play. It is suitable for cases, when you don‚Äôt want to deal with webhooks, the checkout amount changes dynamically, and you want a synchronous confirmation (e.g. SSR SPA).The scenario for manual confirmation looks as follows:In my project, we are presenting the user with a set of available course dates. The user makes a pick, selects a number of people they would like to sign up, and they are presented with a final amount. The user inputs the card details, we use Stripe Elements to generate a token. We send a request to the server, which creates a new payment method from the token, creates a new payment intent, enrols the user in the course with ‚ÄúHot‚Äù status, and responds with next steps. If the card requires 3D Secure confirmation, user is asked to go through the process. Finally after all required steps are fulfilled (or if they are not required), another request is made to the server, where the enrolment status is changed to ‚ÄúEnrolled‚Äù, once the payment intent is confirmed.Let‚Äôs look at the pseudo example:Our n-stripe-card component generates a token using stripe.createToken() of Stripe Elements. The token is being sent to the server alongside the final amount.2. Create a payment intent on the server and respond to the client with further steps.3. Client decides if further action is required, handles 3D secure or not, and responds to the server with the paymentIntentId that needs to be confirmed.4. Server confirms the payment intent and notifies the client of the status.Good luck keeping up with regulations. That‚Äôs it from me for now.Additional Resources:DIRECTIVE 2007/64/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCILPSD2: Strong Customer Authentication by StripeNew EU Regulation for Online Shops: PSD2 and SCA Explained by Jimdo",25/07/2019,1,0,28,2,800,573,1,3,0,7,22
Accessibility Fail Fast Testing Prep,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/accessibility-fail-fast-testing-prep-ec7dee37d258,"Sheri Byrne-Haber, CPACC",22000,6,770,"It was Thomas Edison who famously said:I have not failed, I‚Äôve just found 10,000 ways that won‚Äôt workWhile Thomas Edison never had to deal with the internet (or accessibility !), his principle of ‚Äúlearning from failure‚Äù is one commonly used in software projects today.Fail fast is a type of QA methodology commonly seen in Agile projects. The idea is to find catastrophic failures early, by:Because only approximately 30 % of HTML accessibility testing can be automated and the other 70 % is manual, there is a lot to be said about using an accessibility flavor of the fail fast methodology. No one wants to run three comprehensive manual accessibility test cycles because you failed on something import at the end of the manual cycle. Prioritizing the important, ‚Äúmust work‚Äù things first means if you do have a catastrophic failure, you will find it with a minimum time investment.There are three significant preparation steps you should be taking before testing begins:There are three major reasons why separating function QA and accessibility testing are an important Fail Fast Accessibility strategyAn annual WebAim screen reader user survey shows that more screen users than ever are using multiple screen readers, primarilyNarrator, Orca, and Talkback have noticeable (if small) followings.One interesting data point is that Windows Narrator seems to be trending up, but it is still well below the two most popular Windows screen readers JAWS and NVDA. Orca is an essential if your software can be deployed on Linux.In the US, there is a strong preference by people with disabilities for VoiceOver. This is because of Apple‚Äôs incredibly strong commitment to accessibility. Outside of the US it is more evenly split, likely because of the higher cost of Apple devices. Android is not well-liked in the general population of screen reader users, primarily because it is less robust than Apple with respect to its accessibility approach, and also because Talkback implementations can vary from hardware platform to hardware platform.People with vision loss who may or may not be legally blind use magnification over screen readers. Some people use magnification and screen readers together. There are about 500 % more magnification users than screen reader users. Because those users need as much screen real estate as possible, typically they use larger mobile devices. I have seen many plus-sized mobile device specific defects, especially related to pagination. These types of defects will show up on a plus sized mobile device but not exist on a regular sized mobile device. While I am sure there must be some of the reverse as well (a regular sized mobile device bug that doesn‚Äôt show up on a plus sized mobile device) I‚Äôve never personally seen one.Keyboard only testing on all platforms is essential.If your software isn‚Äôt keyboard accessible, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the rest of your accessibility test results are, this is an automatic release blocker from my perspective.Proper keyboard behavior is one of the most important A level WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Without keyboard accessibility:There is one small component of one keyboard-related guideline (tabindex) that can be tested in an automated test. However, most of the WCAG keyboard operation guideline, plus trap, hover, and the two keyboard focus indicator guidelines can only be validated through manual operation and visual inspection. Yes, the two keyboard focus indicator guidelines are AA. But, as long as you are testing keyboard operation, you might as well throw these in at the same time for a significant time savings. Plus, as a keyboard only user with glaucoma, the focus indicator requirement is very important to me üòä so I always make my team include it with the A level tests.Before you start testing, you need to know how to define when you are done testing. There are two definitions of done, one good, one not so good.The only way to define a ‚Äúbad done‚Äù is to have one, single corporate-wide definition for what constitutes a critical defect. I have some thoughts on that in this article on prioritizing defects for remediation.The best way that I know of to define ‚Äúgood done‚Äù is to have use cases related to you accessibility personas. Anything a well-defined persona can do, they should be able to do with assistive technology. A functional spec will also help you get there as well if you don‚Äôt have personas, though personas are better because they look at the UX from end-to-end and not disjointed pieces of behavior that should work.‚Ä¶In the follow-on to this article which will be published next week I will talk about the steps to actually execute your Fail Fast Accessibility Strategy once you have prepared for it.",25/07/2019,0,0,5,2,1050,1050,1,8,0,3,78
Blockchain solutions for supply chain industries secured by The Proof of Trust,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/blockchain-solutions-for-supply-chain-industries-secured-by-the-proof-of-trust-89c4b1ab8d2,Sam Kelly,21,15,3514,"Blockchain is currently taking the world by storm, and whether you like it or not it is here to stay. Almost every industry is investing heavily in blockchain, and most now recognise the power of decentralised applications (DApps) and smart contracts (SCs), operated using such blockchain platforms as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric. A smart contract has the ability to reduce laborious processes and make it nearly impossible for individuals to renege on a deal, once the SC has been signed. Perhaps the simplest definition of a smart contract comes from Investopedia[1], ‚ÄúSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.‚ÄùThe major benefit of having the agreement encoded is that once conditions are met, the transaction will take place without delay and for the agreed amount. It is absolutely imperative for anyone creating a SC to enter factual, reliable and accurate information. To put it bluntly‚Ä¶ ‚Äòrubbish in results inrubbish out‚Äô. The worst-case scenario for an error strewn SC is that money will be irredeemably lost, a chance that no business or individual would be willing to take. It seems therefore that smart contracts are a fruitless venture, however Proof of Trust (PoT) can effectively eradicate these concerns.This document discusses how several supply chain companies, that have minimum revenues or valuations of in excess of US$1 bn, are utilising blockchain today. The reason for the specific focus on supply chain is because this is currently the most exciting and active area for blockchain investment. It may come as no surprise that blockchain is being hailed as one of the biggest game changers for the supply chain industry, after all it is one of the messiest areas to conduct business and would massively benefit from some added clarity and transparency. In order to successfully manufacture any of the thousands of devices we rely upon daily, a monumental effort on behalf of many hundreds of people and companies is required. It is necessary to coordinate the movement of millions of components through myriad jurisdictions and/or governments. Some of the items may be precious, rare, fragile or even dangerous and come with their own laws and regulations regarding their containment and transportation. In short, to make things happen, a lot of people need to be in agreement about what and how much of something is moving where and at what time. The amount of paperwork required to facilitate effective supply chains is mind boggling. Almost everyone involved, without exception, is in agreement that the process needs to be streamlined and brought into the 21st century. We need to reduce the complexity, reduce the paper consumption, speed up the process while reducing costs in the meantime.It may also come as no surprise to you that blockchain has the potential to facilitate the majority of the required improvements. Below is a list of general blockchain features that stand to streamline supply chain:1. Immutable and secure ‚Äî Every transaction logged on a blockchain is permanent and irreversible, making it nearly impossible to change or delete information once its logged. Unresolved disputes between trustless parties will be all but eradicated.2. Improved traceability ‚Äî All parties with access to the blockchain can view any transaction at any time making it obvious to the location of the goods at any stage of the process.3. Decentralised ‚Äî One of the founding principles of blockchain technology is that it doesn‚Äôt rely on any centralised data storage, all information is stored everywhere on the blockchain, reducing the chances of hacking. Furthermore, the entire chain is self-regulated with no centralised governance, such that nobody can seize control of the operation.4. Automated ‚Äî Many of the processes along the supply chain will be automated, such as goods arrivemoney is transferred, which will dramatically reduce the need for human input thus speeding up the procedure.5. Easy to incorporate ‚Äî Finally all this technology doesn‚Äôt require much in the way of new hardware. Provided companies have computers with internet connection, blockchain technology can be accessed almost instantly. Unlike with the advent of the internet, when routers and computers had to be installed in every office building, blockchain is ready for use.Figure 1. illustrates how Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts would typically be used along the supply chain. There are of course many more conceivable uses, but these are the most thoroughly investigated areas.The above benefits are certainly attainable, but it in order to realise them we must also acknowledge the current limitations or inadequacies of blockchain. Of particular importance, and this cannot be underestimated, is the security of smart contracts. In order to create a SC, real world data must be extracted from an API, website or any other reliable data source. A person with significant coding experience (oracle) is often employed to perform the task of translating written information into computer code. While you would expect that an oracle will perform the task to a high standard, it is impossible to guarantee that any individual will work entirely without error. The PoT protocol is a way of minimising the inevitable human error associated with creating and submitting smart contracts. The protocol itself is a security layer that comes into effect before a smart contract submits a transaction immutably to the blockchain. If there are any concerns following digital flags about the validity of the contract, a user will submit the SC for review via a 2-layer Delegate/SuperDelegate system.The chance of invalid contract executionis reducedform an approximate 1 in 20 for a proficient coder, to an infinitesimal 1 in 500 millionwith the PoT protocol employed. For further information regarding the technicalities of PoT, please refer to the PoT website (https://theproofoftrust.com), where detail can be found on the whitepaper. It is unfathomable that any industry would risk significant financial losses to incorporate new technology because of its potential benefits. In order to realise these benefits security is paramount. With the Proof of Trust, it can be guaranteed that both entered and the smart contract itself are error free, which will play a crucial role in facilitating mass adoption of the technology.As stated above, there are many general benefits to be gained from embracing blockchain technology. There are however many other areas of improvement that are industry specific. Below are just some of the global companies that are piloting different blockchain services, all with the general aim of streamlining the incontrovertibly complex process of supply chain.Supply chain is not the only area within the oil and gas industry that will benefit from adopting new technology. In fact, everything from verification of worker identity to managing the test results of crude oil refining and natural gas purification can be improved with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Perhaps the most pertinent benefit to the oil and gas industry would be directly related to the use of smart contracts. The fact that automation can prevent the need for human intervention could significantly speed up processes that often take longer than they ought to. An example specific to the oil and gas industry is that of fuelling an oil tanker, then automatically charging the cost to the supplier with no human interference at all. There are essentially innumerable ways in which automation will reduce costs and increase the speed along the supply chain. From upstream (locating and extraction of fossil fuels), through to midstream (transportation to refineries) and finally to downstream (post refining) intermediaries are removed transparency is achieved and ultimately costs are lowered (see Figure 2.).Several oil and gas companies have already made head way into blockchain adoption, often in partnership with a large tech firm that has significant blockchain development experience. One partnership of note is between Block Gemini and the Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC). Christopher Fernandez, founder and CEO of Block Gemini, says that the Blockchain solutions they are trialling ‚Äúwill not only increase efficiency, optimize cost, but will also enhance transparency.‚Äù The solutions have been build using IBM‚Äôs Hyperledger and Amazon Cloud web services and, according to Mr Fernandez, it is ‚Äúthe first implementation of its kind in the world.‚Äù Crucially, Block Gemini are beyond the proof of concept (POC) phase and actually have a fully functional supply chain platform that was originally developed for Tristar Transport. Many companies are investigating and seriously considering introducing blockchain, but the fact that Block Gemini have an operational blockchain solution puts them ahead of the game. The three key features they identify from the distributed ledger technology are: enhanced operational excellence and quality, live tracking of deliveries and instant visibility for all warehouse activities [4]. The solution will enhance system integration and increase operational transparency between TRISTAR and ENOC/EPPCO Lubricants, further cementing the close working relationship between both organisations.Most importantly, the introduction of blockchain technology helps ENOC and TRISTAR to improve their company‚Äôs efficiency in line with the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, a project that aims to reduce time effort and resources in a bid to streamline all government processes. Many industries that operate out of Dubai are venturing into the world of blockchain, and Block Dubai is at the heart of many companies‚Äô efforts to incorporate blockchain and DLT.The global food supply chain is another enormous area whereby transparency and efficiency stand to greatly improve customer experience. Since 2017, Leading retailers and food companies including industry giants, Nestl√© and Walmart, have signalled their commitment to ‚Äústrengthen consumer confidence‚Äù in the foods they purchase by announcing a major blockchain collaboration with IBM [5]. Sourcing and supplying fresh producing are arguably the most important and critical processes in any global supply chain. Ensuring that food arrives at the necessary location before it begins to decompose goes beyond loss of product and therefore loss of revenue. If food that is unfit for consumption accidentally makes its way into the system, then hundreds if not thousands of people would be at risk of illness or potentially worse! Figure 3. shows just how blockchain is likely to feature in the global food supply chain.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), approximately 420,000 people die each year as a result of eating contaminated food [6]. The most comprehensive study conducted by WHO also found that 30% of these foodborne deaths affected children under the age of 5. The deaths were generally caused by 1 or more of 31 agents, including bacteria, chemicals, viruses, parasites and toxins. Many of the critical issues impacting food safety such as contamination, food-borne illness, waste and the economic burden of recalls rest on a lack of access to information and poor traceability. In most supply chains there is nobody to oversee the entire process and traceability is only taken in a linear fashion from one supplier to the next. As previously expressed, blockchain is an ideal candidate to fix these glaring issues. With a distributed ledger all processes along the supply chain can me made easily visible to everyone. Even consumers can conceivably access the information about where the goods came from and how long they took to get from A to B. It is clear and obvious how this has the potential to reduce errors in shipping, lowers costs, improve efficiency and most importantly save thousands of lives in the process.Once again IBM is at the heart of the blockchain technology facilitating the necessary improvements. IBM‚Äôs Food Trust platform aims to eradicate the problems discussed in this section. Both Walmart and Nestl√© are heavily involved with Food Trust and are using it extensively to improve the quality of food and services brought to consumers. As with other sectors, many people are talking about blockchain but the number of industries that are actually implementing is much fewer. Walmart are very much in the camp that are actively incorporating blockchain solutions right now. As of September 2019, all suppliers of leafy green vegetables to Walmart must upload the data to the blockchain. This technique has already shown dramatic improvements in the tracking of food items. Prior to technological upgrades it would take up to 7 days to trace the source of food, with blockchain it takes approximately 2.2 seconds [8]. This monumental improvement in tracking time has many clear advantages, but crucially easier to trace reduces the risk of people consuming unsafe food. The probability of another outbreak of E. coli occurring due to contaminated lettuce, such as the one that affected many in the US and Canada in 2018 [9], is far less likely to occur if people have access to the data anytime anywhere.Nestl√© are approaching it from a slightly different angle, in that they are addressing another huge global issue using the same technology. It is well documented that Nestl√© haven‚Äôt had the best publicity in recent years. There have been many claims that Nestl√© have acted unscrupulously with regards to child labour and utilising water in countries where it is scarce. But the most recent headlines involving Nestl√© are welcome ones. With the introduction of IMB‚Äôs Food Trust, consumers will be able to trace where goods have come from and make informed decisions about the products they buy. Nestl√© executive vice president, Magdi Batato, says ‚ÄúWe want our consumers to make an informed decision on their choice of products ‚Äî to choose products produced responsibly. Open blockchain technology might allow us to share reliable information with consumers in an accessible way,‚Äù indicating that Nestl√© are responding to criticism about the way in which they operate by introducing blockchain technology to reduce the harmful impact of irresponsibly sourced and produced goods. Nestl√© first introduced blockchain 2 years ago in 2017, when alongside French retailer, Carrefour, they used the technology to track Mouslinepotato puree. In June of this year Carrefour attributed an increase in sales to the transparent tracking that DLT has enabled [10].Shipping giant Maersk (who make up 16% of the global fleet and are the largest shipping company in the world [11]) have teamed up with IBM to create TradeLens. According to the Maersk website, TradeLens is a blockchain platform ‚Äúdesigned to promote more efficient and secure global trade, bringing together various parties to support information sharing and transparency, and spur industry-wide innovation‚Äù. Currently, in excessive of 100 organisations are actively using the TradeLens platform. More than 20 port and terminal operators are involved with the project, including PSA Singapore, Holt Logistics at the port of Philadelphia and Modern Terminals in Hong Kong. Several other shipping lines including PIL, Hamburg S√ºd and most recently ZIM are also part of the program. Additionally, multiple customs authorities are using the technology: the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Australia to name but a few. TradeLens permits collaboration across the many parties involved in international trade. Smart contracts are at the heart of this digital collaboration. One example was found to reduce the transit time for shipment of packaging materials to a production line in the USA by 40% [12]. Some of the participants of the TradeLens platform are predicting that the number of steps taken to answer fundamental questions, such as the ‚Äòwhat is the location of my container‚Äô, will be reduced by a factor of 10. More than 360 million shipping events have been processed on the TradeLens platform, and approximately 1 million more are added each day [13]. Using blockchain technology, the pace of interaction between parties is increased, the amount of empty space in containers is reduced and up to 5 intermediaries are eliminated from the process.The current cost of global shipping is $1.8 trillion dollars annually, with savings of up to 10% thought to be eminently achievable [14]. Moreover, by improving the efficiency along the supply chain, global shipping volume is predicted to increase by as much as 15%, as shown in Figure 4.. An increase in shipping will create more jobs, compensating for the reduction of intermediary roles.As of April 2019, Intel, Flex and UPS successfully executed more than a dozen trades on a blockchain system, in parallel to their current traditional systems. The blockchain system that was developed on the permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, used predefined templates to model which parties are involved at each stage of the trade. Although just at the proof of concept stage, the test was extremely promising and revealed the following key insights:¬∑ A real time view of the current state of the trade ‚Äî As each party involved in the trade can view the up to date information on its state of completion, any inconsistencies in information that exist today were immediately eradicated.¬∑ Smart contracts eliminate considerable time and resources ‚Äî With the end to end process being automated through SCs, delayed shipments and payments were avoided as multiple checks at throughout shipment to permit the next stage were not necessary.¬∑ Tamper-proof and reliable data shared by all parties ‚Äî Accurate information is available to all parties at any stage of transaction, preventing disputes over costs from goods stuck in warehouses and ports.According to Ganesh Wadawadigi, writing for Digitalist Magazine, ‚ÄúIntel, Flex, and UPS continue to explore topics like extending smart contracts with automated data validation rules.‚Äù While the Proof of Concept unsurprisingly revealed that Blockchain and smart contracts provided a significant improvement to operations at all stages of the supply chain, it is eminently clear that for this technology to become the main system for all operations, all data must be reliable and accurate. When operating on a full scale, with myriad companies across international borders, data accuracy is key. Invalid or inaccurate data would be catastrophic for industries and could even lead to legal proceedings.All industries discussed in this document are actively developing blockchain technology today, with a specific focus on how smart contracts can streamline and simplify innumerable process. The companies featured here are just a small selection of many, valued at over US$1 bn, that are committing incredible time and effort into developing blockchain technology. It was the aim of this document to discuss the way in which global businesses are becoming more interconnected, saving billions of dollars and exhibiting greater transparency through the use of blockchain. Many industries have been pouring money into trials and research involving blockchain. Several companies have gone beyond the proof of concept phase and are now actively deploying the cutting-edge technology to facilitate colossal positive changes. Supply chain is possibly the area for greatest return on incorporating blockchain. From saving time and money, reducing the number of required intermediaries and streamlining a multitude of process blockchain has a lot to offer. In the area of global food production blockchain could, quite literally, save lives. In all the cases reported here, smart contracts play a crucial role in permitting the exchange of good and automating many of the processes along the chain. While consumers will have little interaction with smart contracts, industries certainly will need to understand how to use and even create their own in order to conduct business efficiently.Wherever smart contracts are to be employed, security is paramount. Transactions amounting to billions of dollars occur along the supply chains of oil and gas, global food and general shipping. When huge sums of money are involved the risk is far too large for all companies to take, without assurance that funds are going be transferred correctly. It is the firm belief of The Proof of Trust that the PoT protocol will dramatically improve smart contract security, whilst reducing the effects of the ‚Äòoracle problem‚Äô at the point of real-world data entry. With improved security, regulation will follow and will encourage greater use between businesses and consumers. In short, The Proof of Trust will play a vital role as industries look to increase the use of blockchain and DLT technology.1.

Should I Quit My Job Today?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/should-i-quit-my-job-today-ad71a99ce872,Omar Rabbolini,641,7,1336,"Another day, another feature. Such was the life at this startup I joined in my early years in Hong Kong. Every iteration would bring new requirements for the product, and tight deadlines along with them. We used to work an average of ten hours a day, and leave the office well past 10pm as releases neared. It seemed what we did was never enough, and we were always playing catch up with the latest business requirements.Yet, I stuck with it, and so did the rest of the engineering team. Why did we put ourselves through such an ordeal?In my case, it was a combination of factors: I needed a job to keep my visa going, I wanted to prove myself as a manager (and later VP), especially in a new country, and I liked making mobile software. The fact we used bleeding edge technology also helped, and so did the great connection I shared with my team members. We were a big family, and I regret that our eventual acquisition came with a relocation package to the UK which, while great for the rest of them, did not really work for me as I had no intention of moving back West.I thought about that chapter of my life this past week as a few people I met are struggling with the will to carry on with their job, some because of the delicate situation that Hong Kong is facing at the moment, others more simply because their manager or their company is, or has become, uninspiring for a number of different reasons.The real question is: does it make sense to stick to a job when you are no longer inspired?Motivation to work in a startup or product company really boils down to the following considerations:These are directly related to the company you work for, and are normally joined by a fifth pillar which is more outward-facing:If all five aspects are aligned, congratulations. There is really no reason for you to quit. Maybe you have a better offer somewhere else, but there is no guarantee that all the boxes above will be checked once you move, so you should consider your decision very carefully.In the majority of cases, one or more aspects are dissatisfactory or misaligned with one‚Äôs goals and beliefs. If you are in this situation, you should look at the positive aspects of your job and decide whether they are reason enough to stay. Assuming the problems you are seeing are not coming from within the core of the company, there is a chance that they might be resolved as time goes by.In fact, this is a good chance for you to be the change that you need in your organization. Working with your peers and your manager should help you see these issues through, either by actually resolving them, or by reframing your perception as you gain a more complete picture of the situation. For instance, a tedious feature set which makes it look like the company has given up on innovation might reveal itself as being in actuality a short-term goal required to win a specific client over.In any circumstance, it is important to have a good understanding of the actual state of the company and your role before making a decision. Do not be afraid to ask for information and gather as much detail as possible from veritable sources, especially when the issues you are facing come from one of the first three pillars: Technology, Product and Mission.‚ÄúThe two most powerful warriors are patience and time‚Äù ‚Äî Leo TolstoyTolerance levels vary from person to person. Somebody might be able to live just on Motivation-By-Proxy for years on end, while a more ambitious individual would only put up with, let‚Äôs say, an issue with the product roadmap only if it is bound to be resolved within a couple of quarters.When looking into quitting, it is important to consider whether the issue is temporary or permanent, and whether you can live with it for as long as it persists.When you are in the thick of things, it is difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel and instead fall into a pattern of thought that makes whatever issue we are facing seem like a permanent reality. When considering whether to quit in these cases, it is beneficial to delay the decision until the ‚Äúdark period‚Äù is over so that we can take a step back and consider the issue in the right perspective.Also on the topic of timing, it is important to consider the financial impact of the decision on your life. There is always a risk that whatever endeavor you might partake does not work out as expected. This risk of course varies depending on the nature of your next chapter, for instance quitting to become an entrepreneur is more risky than leaving for a new job which is already lined up, but should nevertheless be taken into account.Is it really a success if you are succeeding at what you do not like doing?The five pillars of motivation we looked at earlier are a framework to help you find the motivation to stick around. They do not deal with your lifetime goals, and they assume the job you are doing fits in your overall life purpose. But what if this is not the case?You are where you are today undoubtedly because of prior choices in your life. Maybe you decided to study Computer Science because you were good at Math and your parents thought technology was a viable career, but you really liked to play the violin instead. Maybe you have a knack for writing, but never wrote anything beyond technical specs because you thought you are not good enough.Notwithstanding the commitments you already made in your life, you should never give up on your true passion. Maybe you buried it under a pile of success and achievements, or maybe you locked it away to conform to certain expectations from your family, community and society at large.Maybe your dissatisfaction with your current job is a subconscious reaction of your true self to the artificial cage you built around it. Maybe it‚Äôs time to set yourself free.Working on your passion does not necessarily require a radical change in your work. You do not need to completely switch overnight and restart your career from scratch.You can ease into your new career by choosing a freelance or part-time gig related to your present profession to keep the money flowing as you spend more time developing your new skillset.Alternatively, you can look for a company where you can apply both and make a transition over time. For instance, if music is your thing and you are a software engineer, maybe you can look at companies that produce music software. That might give you the opportunity to network with professional musicians and allow you to either change career, or otherwise express your talents by doing both something you like and something you are good at.In conclusion, the decision of quitting revolves around whether the time you are investing in your current job is time well spent. In other words, is it aligned with and does it help you achieve your lifetime goals? The moment this is no longer the case, you can safely leave with no regrets. After all, time is a finite commodity.Also, the people factor is important. Are you working with people you can trust? Is your manager and your organization supportive of your growth? Any misalignment here might affect how quickly you reach your goals, and therefore should be of major consideration in your decision.I hope you found this brief article useful, and I will be glad to discuss your specific situation further if you wish to do so.

No Foundation Without Representation,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/no-foundation-without-representation-d53107135d32,Allison Kopf,686,7,1302,"As a woman in tech, I am hyper aware of the representation inequalities that plague not only the tech industry and venture capital, but boardrooms and leadership teams at large. Having sat on both sides of the proverbial table (founder and investor), I remain firm in my belief that diversity fosters strength, no matter the industry, no matter the company, no matter the work.Here‚Äôs the not-so-pretty picture ‚Äî 71% of VC firms in the US still don‚Äôt have a single female partner on their teams and of the $130 billion that VCs invested last year, just 2% went to female-founded companies.Men raise rounds on average 3x larger than women. Less than 50 black women have raised more than $1 million in venture capital. Let‚Äôs not forget that the world is not binary. While there aren‚Äôt many stats on capital raises led by non-binary founders, the experience no doubt pales in comparison to those with more conventional backgrounds. We cannot leave people behind. It‚Äôs time to change.Founders have a responsibility to create a diverse and inclusive work environment. Our strength lies with our differences. The more we begin to reflect what our society looks like, the better we‚Äôll perform as companies. And this has to go beyond diversity. True inclusion is about creating a respectful environment where everyone is treated with dignity, no matter their gender identity or race or sexual orientation or age or any other factor that makes them who they are.I love Ellen K. Pao‚Äôs 10‚Äì10‚Äì5‚Äì45 guideline for metrics. Tech startups are inherently good at thinking about metrics, and having a goal that starts to mirror the US workforce is a good starting point.The 10‚Äì10 is representative of racial diversity. Pao and Project Include advocate that 10% of employees should be Black/African American/African and 10% of employees should be Latinx/Hispanic. Project Include also encourages pushing past these targets toward 13% and 17% to be more representative of the US workforce.The 5‚Äì45 is representative of gender identity. Typically, benchmarking ignores non-binary employees. According to Pao, ‚Äú5% of an inclusive company‚Äôs workforce will likely be non-binary. The remaining employees should be an even balance of men and women with a hard target of 45% identifying as women.‚ÄùI am the founder and CEO of Artemis, an agriculture technology company that develops software and cultivation tools to help create a more profitable and safer agricultural supply chain. It‚Äôs been an exciting year for us. Not only did we close our $8m Series A, our team also doubled in size in six months.At Artemis, we take diversity and inclusion seriously.[Note: 16% of our company does not specify their race and we value employee privacy.]We‚Äôve got room to grow. While we‚Äôre doing better than many companies, the work doesn‚Äôt stop here and we don‚Äôt want it to. In our industry, 68% of farmworkers are born in Mexico and 35% cannot speak English. Of all farmworkers, the average level of completed education is 8th grade. As a company in the agriculture space, we cannot afford to maintain a team that is only 6%, or even 10% Latix/Hispanic.From our headquarters in Brooklyn, our team speaks six different languages. But our team ‚Äî which is spread out across North America ‚Äî is multicultural, multilingual and multinational. Only a month ago, we made our first full-time international hire (in Canada). The types of farms and farmers we support vary greatly, and naturally, the team of engineers, designers, biologists and problem-solvers that serve them should too.I took a pledge with All Raise to be part of #FoundersForChange.‚ÄúI believe in a more diverse and inclusive tech industry. I am dedicated to having a diverse team and board, and when I have a choice of investment partners in the future, the diversity of their firms will be an important consideration.‚ÄùThis isn‚Äôt just about creating an inclusive team, it‚Äôs about choosing partners who value diversity as well. The Artemis board is led by women ‚Äî 75% of our Directors are women. We‚Äôve paid attention to fund makeup as well, preferring to pitch funds with a more diverse partnership. Funds that choose not to hire women in senior roles are not a culture fit for us as a company.Truly independent board directors can also alleviate board homogeneity. It‚Äôs a chance to choose board members and it should be used well ‚Äî not just for diversity. I propose having independent board members for our customers, too. If you ask a question at a board meeting, and everyone at the table has the exact same answer, you need to rethink how you source your counsel.We work hard to make this a reality for all members of our team. I hold weekly office hours open to anyone and everyone at our company. We have a form for anonymous questions to be answered at our weekly all-hands company meetings. We build a path to promotion internally so that there is a clear road to leadership. We do not negotiate salaries at Artemis, instead opting for pay ranges by position to help eliminate gender pay gap issues right from the start.At Artemis, we have also developed a set of core values that reflect the way our team works together. We even discuss them weekly in our all-hands company meetings (ways we‚Äôre doing well and ways we can improve).Talent retention is equally as important as hiring. We not only work hard to hire amazing people, but also to keep them.One of the single most important days of my career was the day I was able to offer healthcare to my employees. We‚Äôve focused on ensuring we have the right benefits for our employees. Shedding the perception of ping pong tables and beer taps, we focused instead on long and encouraged vacations, adequate time off for parental leave, flexible work hours (especially important for childcare), good health insurance options, and more. On top of that, we‚Äôve built a remote-first office that allows employees to work from anywhere. We encourage continuous learning and many of our team members have given talks at leading conferences, both related to and unrelated to our business directly.Growth should never come at the expense of your company‚Äôs core values. As Artemis VP of Business Development Jon Schmitz says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty simple ‚Äî when you love your job, you do great things.‚ÄùThe lack of access to venture capital for founders of non-traditional backgrounds frustrates me to no end. It‚Äôs one of many reasons why I joined XFactor Ventures ‚Äî a VC fund devoted to pre/seed investments in companies with a billion dollar market opportunity and at least one female founder ‚Äî as an investment partner.It‚Äôs time we back up words with money. If you‚Äôre raising your next round, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.Founders For Change envisions a tech industry in which ‚Äúthe people leading, shaping and funding the future better reflect the world‚Äù and I wholeheartedly agree that‚Äôs the only path forward. As founders, it‚Äôs our responsibility to build companies that support the people that keep them in business. Customers and employees deserve that much from us.All Raise is encouraging all founders and investors to start asking the questions. Questions like:A commitment to diversity has to start at the top. When leadership devotes time and energy to fostering a diverse, equitable, scalable environment for their business and their team, the effects ripple throughout the company. I know that the diversity of my team will, without question, only make Artemis stronger ‚Äî our product, our brand, our values and our influence.Don‚Äôt just make money, make change.We‚Äôre actively hiring at Artemis. If you‚Äôd like to work with us, reach out to Jeff Miller at jmiller@artemisag.com. If you‚Äôre a female founder raising your first round of funding, I‚Äôd love to hear from you: akopf@artemisag.com.

The O-1 Visa: Hiding In Plain Sight?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-o-1-visa-hiding-in-plain-sight-65408064fe9a,Hendrik Pretorius,6,5,1006,"Whichever side of the immigration debate you fall on, it is an actual fact that since early 2017 obtaining work authorization in the United States as a highly skilled professional has become much more difficult. Among many statistics bearing this out, including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services‚Äô H-1B Employer Data Hub, there have been massive increases in case processing delays and denied cases. It used to be that the biggest concern for international skilled workers was getting selected in the H-1B lottery each year, based on the limited number of 85,000 new H-1B visas made available each year. Now that is only the first of several hurdles.Looking at the list of visa options available to foreign nationals, as listed on the Department of State‚Äôs website, it may appear at first blush to be endless. However, upon closer consideration, the options for the great majority of skilled foreign nationals seeking employment or hoping to run their own companies becomes very short very quickly.For the vast majority of highly educated and experienced professionals from across the globe being recruited by U.S. companies, the options provided by these companies appear to boil down to only one option, the H-1B. But is there a glaring visa option missing?Why Only The H-1B?It is true that the list of visa options available to highly skilled professionals seeking a solution for employment or to start their own business can be counted on one hand. However, there may be a few reasons why the number of options may be even narrower than required.The first is the reality that in the world of corporate immigration law, the vast majority of cases are handled by immigration law firms representing the company as their paying client and at the same time entering into dual representation engagements purporting to also represent the immigration interests of the foreign national candidates. This type of dual representation is rarely seen in other areas of the law, for good reason.The argument used to pursue this approach is that the interests of all parties are aligned during this part of the immigration case life cycle. However, as you can imagine, if a company decides for any reason, whether justified or not, that only an H-1B is an option, then that is the option that will be pursued without much further inquiry.Further, it often seems to be the case that foreign national talent seeking to work in the United States are reluctant to rock the boat and instead wish to pursue the easiest visa option suggested. Interestingly, foreign national talent can often underestimate their leverage in setting immigration options due to the competitive labor market desperately seeking STEM talent.One area where the convergence of these considerations ends up harming global talent seeking to contribute in the United States is the failure to consider one of the most underutilized but flexible visa options, the O-1 ‚Äúextraordinary ability‚Äù visa.Intent Behind The O-1 VisaThe O-1 visa, often known as the extraordinary ability visa, is the closest that the U.S. immigration system has to a merit-based visa option. The H-1B visa focuses on specific job duties and wages and a candidate‚Äôs educational background, and the entrepreneurial E-2 investor visa and L-1A new office visa focus on the standing of a business, but the O-1 directly focuses on an individual‚Äôs past proven ability.The basic idea is that a foreign national with a proven track record should be allowed to enter the United States on this merit to apply these skills in the U.S. for the benefit of the country, whether as an employee or working on an itinerary of projects.The NumbersI believe the O-1 visa is underutilized. Considering the Department of State statistics, there are a comparatively small number of O-1 visas processed at U.S. consular posts worldwide, with only 16,904 O-1 visas issued in 2018. In comparison, there were roughly 179,660 H-1B visas issued; 41,181 E-2 visas and 74,388 L-1 visas.Also note that this gap would be much larger if not for the annual H-1B quota placed on new H-1Bs available to those who are not already in this status, thereby artificially reducing the number of H-1B visas that can possibly be issued each year by the Department of State.Why The O-1 Underutilization?It is easy to just jump to the assumption that there just aren‚Äôt nearly as many extraordinary-ability foreign nationals as there are professional workers or entrepreneurs seeking the H-1B, E-2 or L-1. I think this answer is too simplistic.Is it possible that when considering the O-1 visa as an option for global talent that the interests of all parties are not actually aligned? Not only does the O-1 provide more flexibility in project-based work, but the O-1 is generally not as streamlined of a process for immigration attorneys as is the more generic H-1B, thereby costing more money and taking more time.Additionally, there also appears to be a lack of understanding about the O-1 visa as being a realistic and useful option in the entrepreneurial context. With there being no actual startup visa available to entrepreneurs in the United States, those with an entrepreneurial bent resort to figuring out the limits they can push in pursuing business ideas while being tied to an employer on an H-1B. Instead, the O-1 should at least be given a chance.Lastly, there does seem to be an unfortunate reality that people often fail to see themselves in the O-1 light. This self-doubt can and does stop qualifying candidates from giving the O-1 the chance it deserves.With this article, I do not mean to say that the O-1 visa is for everyone or easy, but I do believe that it is greatly underutilized in the U.S. immigration system as the U.S. works to attract the very best and brightest from around the globe.The information provided here is not legal advice and does not purport to be a substitute for advice of counsel on any specific matter.

Cybersecurity In Industrial Control Systems: The Evolving Threat Landscape,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/cybersecurity-in-industrial-control-systems-the-evolving-threat-landscape-7ab01d12dee,Pavel Glukhikh,88,16,1956,"So far in my IT career, I have worked in or done work for several chemical plants and factory locations. These locations all had very different operations, procedures, culture, and people. However, the one thing that was the same throughout all of these locations was the security culture and technology, or lack of it.Usually, the places I have worked at are all owned by large, multi-national energy or manufacturing companies, and all of these have a corporate environment. In most of these places, IT is managed top-down in a waterfall fashion. You know the type: you need to submit a help desk ticket to some team 3 countries away just to get access to SharePoint or some other trivial issue.During one of my previous jobs, I worked at chemical plant, and my main day to day duties were managing the non-control servers and infrastructure (the office network).Because of these methods, I often had to preform, what a cybersecurity analyst would consider, trivial and unnecessary work. This included everything from using complex, clunky compliance applications that only got worse with every update, tedious and repetitive ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù tasks that did exactly nothing to secure systems, and lastly and most defiantly least: writing pointless comments on every task that I preformed just for the sake of ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù.Also, there was little to no user or even admin training regarding threats, and what little security training was issued involved completely irrelevant or absurd threat scenarios.Obviously, this is not the approach that companies should be taking for securing their systems, especially in environments where a network breach, or compromised control system can cost someone their life.‚ÄúAs an admin of the office network, if you make a mistake, users will just lose connection to YouTube. If the control system engineer next door makes a mistake, someone might die.‚ÄùNo pressure.Now, let‚Äôs dive in to the messy inter-workings surrounding enterprise and control system security. Let‚Äôs start where cybersecurity originates: at the top.I‚Äôm not going to get into the whole ‚Äúsomeone isn't qualified to make security policy‚Äù debate as this post focuses on the technical aspect. This however, is a re-occurring aspect in large companies: CIOs and CISOs get hired only because of who they know, or their reputation in the company, and not necessarily because of what they know.Security and IT knowledge should be passed from top to bottom, and everyone in the company from the CIO down to the contracted night-time janitor should be aware of all security procedures. This is often not done due to the costs required for developing programs and training personnel. However, a company can solve the cost issue by simply controlling costs. Don‚Äôt let vendors charge you premium prices just because you are a large company, use open source training platforms, and hire a few experienced security professionals instead of a large firm that is only experienced in training systems.No matter what corporate or some security solutions vendor tells you, cybersecurity does not have a one size fits all solution. Security is different for every team, every office, and every service. You simply cannot purchase a product, set up a rule, and press ‚Äúapply to all‚Äù. It doesn't work that way. Each business unit or team may have their own way of handling data, day to day operations, and their own security practices. Here is where we get into the more complex issue of standardizing operations between business units and team in various locations. That is a paradox of corporate policy that can have it‚Äôs own post. For now let‚Äôs assume that the standards in the company are not 100% the same across every site, as most are not.Here are some examples of blanket policy mistakes to avoid:Bottom line: configure applications smartly, use alternate authentication, adjust the corporate mindset.A typical threat can come from any direction. Most large companies only focus on traffic ingress points in their network, the WAN connections, remote links, etc. However, a threat can come from just about anywhere.Here are some of the most common ways that threats spread in control system networks:Because of the varied nature of these attacks, a one size fits all solution will not work as each attack requires a different mitigation strategy. Most of these attacks do have something in common: people. People are the first and last line of defense for many of these attacks. Empowering the workforce can be separated into two categories: training and educating the users and empowering your IT staff.Before we dive into the human aspects of cybersecurity, let‚Äôs look at the technical stuff.Note that the mitigation actions for these attacks can vary. The ones listed here are just the ones I have implemented, simulated, or have seen implemented.Here are the common mitigations that apply to all of these attacks:Now, let‚Äôs look at how to defend against the attacks mentioned above:www.honeywellprocess.comBasically, it uses a portable terminal to scan removable media and secure it with a special marker indicating that it has been scanned and that no data was modified post-scan on an insecure machine. The user then inserts the secured drive into an authorized computer that has SME software installed, which authorizes the drive to be opened if it has been secured.Interesting concept, however no system is prefect. There are still some advanced attack vectors that can be used to circumvent this system (these are advanced topics which are out of scope of this post).Internet of things devices are becoming more and more popular in the industrial control system environment. Large vendors like Honeywell, GE and Emerson are using IOT devices in their newer industrial solutions. Before we go on, I would like to point out the fact that IOT devices that are intended for use in industrial environments are different than the IOT devices provided by a consumer oriented vendor such as Nest or Ring. The difference is usually in the software and management protocols that the devices run. For example, an industrial device will most likely not run the Zigbee control protocol but will rather use a proprietary, sometimes encrypted protocol provided by the vendor or OEM.Let‚Äôs first look at consumer IOT products, such as the Nest Learning Thermostat. This device controls your A/C unit and allows you to manage all of your unit‚Äôs settings via the Nest app. In order to accomplish this, the unit must communicate out to the internet via Zigbee or some other protocol‚Ä¶.wait a minute, communicate out? To the internet? No way. All of my IOT devices are behind a firewall and none of them are allowed to call home, or send traffic anywhere outside the local network. But this poses a problem: how do we get updates to those devices? How do we manage them. We adapt, and we force the vendors to adapt. Unfortunately this is a lost cause with Nest. They don‚Äôt seem to understand the concept of IOT security and use a closed protocol which I can‚Äôt do anything with. However, for other devices, I can use an on-prem IOT server which I can then control via a single app or interface. This has also has other advantages besides security. If you manage all of the data flow, you can look at the data using any software you want (Kibana, Balena IOT, etc). Another benefit to this is that you don‚Äôt need to download six million apps just to control one house or building.Process control IOT infrastructure has similar security issues. One common thing I have seen a lot of vendors do is to put everything in the cloud. If a vendor asks you if you want ‚Äúmanaged cloud services‚Äù or some other cloud based offering for any product that resides in or touches your PCE, DECLINE IT. Stop trying to be fancy and stick process control infrastructure into the cloud. If you need to open your PCE firewall to the outside world (anywhere outside the facility) for any reason, you're doing it wrong. There is no good reason for not having PCE infrastructure on-site. Now, does that mean you should only keep the data on-prem? Probably not, as most modern disaster recovery and BC strategies use cloud based backup, but when designing process control systems, use common sense.You should not however, have a live data stream (read or write) going anywhere outside the local facility. Note: I know there are ways to mitigate and secure cloud traffic with AWS, encrypted private connections, etc‚Ä¶.I know. But don‚Äôt be fancy with your PCE. Save the cloud migration for your office network.Next, have an IOT strategy that is adopted by all of your sites. Many times I have been in facilities where to the question of where is your IOT procedures guide, the answer was‚Ä¶.‚Äùuuummm, we don‚Äôt have one?‚Äù The document should be put together by security researchers and specialists, experts in IOT, and peer reviewed by local IT or PCE engineering teams. IT should include all policies and guidelines on rolling out new IOT systems, which vendors are approved for use, and any other procedures that should be followed when working with IOT systems.When implementing IOT systems into your process control environment, you should always ask the following:Many times I have seen management implement or not implement things simply because it was a ‚Äúgood idea‚Äù from the vendor or was a ‚Äúpart of a requirement for corporate IT‚Äù. I‚Äôm going to be blunt here: if an idea doesn't make sense, don‚Äôt implement it. No matter where is comes from. In most companies, the local admins and engineers are responsible for the facility‚Äôs process control systems. Management should always listen to, and evaluate the input of their IT and engineering staff. Keep an open mind and try to see things from the employee‚Äôs perspective. I could write an entire post on this, as this is a re-occurring problem in the enterprise and small business environments.The cost of the solution has nothing to do with how secure the solution is. A lot of times, the mindset in the manufacturing and energy industries is that more expensive is always better and that open source has no business being anywhere in the enterprise environment. This is simply flawed thinking that results from decades of overcharging by vendors and uncontrolled pricing that exists because nobody ever pushes back on it. Large control system vendors such as Honeywell and Emerson are notorious for doing this. They take a simple technology, modify it a little, and sell it at 10 times what it cost to develop and manufacture. Security has also been affected by this. The general mindset of more expensive and professional means more secure needs to end.Also, companies should start embracing open source software and hardware for their control systems. There is no reason why open source should not be used in the PCE environment as long as it is secured to the same high standards that everything else is. A common excuse for not using open source in the PCE is that it cannot be used alongside the systems that other vendors provide due to ‚Äúqualification reasons‚Äù. While this is true in a few edge cases (where unlike systems can cause problems), installation and designed by qualified individuals should mitigate this issue. Most of the time, this is only done by vendors to squeeze more money out of customers. If the control protocols of the open source systems are alike, and a common API exists between the two, there should be little to no security or operational hurdles toward implementation and integration of open source systems.In conclusion, be smart about security, go ahead and deploy that open source IOT platform, employ qualified people to design your security procedures, mitigate threats before they happen, and listen to / empower your workforce.As always, thanks for reading.

Discover the 3 Unknown Traits of People with High Individuality,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/discover-the-3-unknown-traits-of-people-with-high-individuality-5f402e1f2a57,A. Hafidh,21,4,793,"‚ÄòOh, to be like everyone else.‚Äô Said nobody influential, ever.Like a moth to the proverbial flame, we are magnetised to an intangible energy that people with high individuality (PHI‚Äôs) often assume.But why?What is it about those rare gems that are willing and able to be acknowledged as fundamentally ‚Äòunique‚Äô, that makes us so attracted to them?You see people without a high degree of individuality will treat life like an assorted box of chocolates that they got for Christmas. You don‚Äôt really know which ones you like and you can't be bothered reading the little pamphlet, so you just cross your fingers, close your eyes and dive in.Below, I have outlined for you the common thread amongst people with high individuality and for the purposes of this article, I‚Äôll call them ‚ÄòPHI‚Äôs.‚ÄôGordan Ramsey, the Michelin Star chef and TV personality was once asked what it was that he thought separated a good chef from a great one.His candid response: ‚ÄòTaste.‚ÄôWhat Gordan was inferring was that all chefs have the capacity to cook decent food and work hard to hone their craft, but the PHI‚Äôs will also have a naturally great pallet. They have a sensitivity to food that the rest of us do not. Thus, they have the potential to achieve higher echelons of success and influence by tapping into that.PHI‚Äôs have a strong intrinsic belief that their personal ‚Äòtaste‚Äô is the cornerstone of who they are, which will, eventually, inform their subjective inclination towards a particular path.‚ÄòTaste‚Äô often shows up as natural talent, but when contextualised, can embody a number of different disciplines across a wide spectrum of industries.Why we are attracted to them:Since the 1950s, we have grown accustomed to the word ‚ÄòTasteMaker‚Äô, as a person who decides or influences what is, or will become fashionable in a given field.The origin of how these people came to assume such lofty positions in our collective consciousness is one for the sociologists and economists to decipher. Nevertheless, the fact that they have such a strong pull on how the majority of us perceive ‚Äòsomething‚Äô is indicative of their overall influence on society.Have you ever heard the famous Dr Seuss saying:‚ÄúBe who you are and say what you mean. Because those who mind don‚Äôt matter and those who matter don‚Äôt mind!‚Äù.It‚Äôs a shout out to being confident, being your own person, following your heart and believing in yourself.Building confidence, not arrogance is a learning curve many people struggle to overcome. It can be the difference between reaching your goal, spending a lifetime almost getting there or never even getting started.Fundamentally speaking, PHI‚Äôs are inherently brave and steadfast in their beliefs.They are able to maintain a fine balance between listening to those around them who matter, whilst simultaneously being wary not to allow the opinions of others cloud their judgement or belittle their conviction.In order to fully actualise their potential and push conventional wisdom, they often challenge the status quo, whether consciously or otherwise.PHI‚Äôs are often terrible people-pleasers who consign themselves to the belief that ‚Äòthe only judgement one can bestow is on oneself.‚ÄôExternal influences such as peers, reference groups or higher powers, have little to no effect on the will and veracity of a person with high individuality.Why we are attracted to them:Throughout the ages, thought leaders and influencers have been characterised as such because they were willing and courageous enough to ‚Äògo against the grain‚Äô.In the early stages, they may well have been met with resistance from the mainstream ideal, but once society caught up, their inherent perseverance- combined with natural talent, cemented their place in our hearts.Lady Gaga, Steve Jobs and many other notable celebrities are a testament to this.The internal decision-making process for PHI‚Äôs is primarily intuition-orientated.By following their inner voice, they are able to quickly adapt to new situations or pick up on innovation faster than mainstream society.Characteristically then, PHI‚Äôs often shown up as ‚ÄòInnovators‚Äô or ‚ÄòEarly Adopters‚Äô on the Adoption Life Cycle which legitimises their influence on the masses.This is primarily down to the fact that once they have picked an innovation up, it becomes acceptable for everyone else to do so too, albeit at different rates.Why we are attracted to them?By being ‚Äòrisk-tolerant‚Äô, PHI‚Äôs have an uncanny ability to drive society into new spheres of awareness.Ultimately, because they have chosen authenticity over generality, we come to admire the requisite conviction and courage it takes to show up in that way.You see, ‚Äòintegrity‚Äô is a word we rarely use anymore. Overlooked and outdated in a world of heady escapism and filtered images.Thankfully though, the conversation is slowly gaining traction as we are witnessing a deft cultural shift in favour and appreciative of the unconventional.The inspiring nature of the individual has begun to make waves in the collective spirit of society.",25/07/2019,0,0,2,8,983,975,3,0,0,4,25

Net Neutrality Lives on Thanks to Save the Internet and New State Laws,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/net-neutrality-lives-on-thanks-to-save-the-internet-and-new-state-laws-edc756ede2e7,Samantha Joule Fow,36,7,1506,"For those of us lucky enough to live in places with access to it, the internet is an authentic free space. No one can own or control it, but everyone can participate as they choose. And just like any freedom, open access to the internet is easy to take for granted when it‚Äôs available and devastating when it is lost.America‚Äôs net neutrality rules were passed as protective measures against potentially unfair and discriminatory practices Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are naturally incentivized into by the natural functioning of a capitalistic market. But they also bore the unfortunate characteristic of being Obama-era policies ‚Äî which means they were immediately ripped to shreds by a successor eager to dismantle the prior administration‚Äôs legacy. Despite this massive change in national internet law, however, ISPs have pretty much continued with business as usual.Over a year since net neutrality ended as an official federal policy, little has changed ‚Äî which begs the question of whether we even need formalized net neutrality laws anymore. After all, there‚Äôs been a flurry of public action in response to the Federal Communication Commission‚Äôs (FCC‚Äôs) repeal of net neutrality in 2018; will transparency and accountability to the public be enough to keep ISPs from giving wealthier customers better internet access?No, probably not. But fortunately we won‚Äôt have to worry about it, since the forces at work outside of Washington are working hard to address the gaps left behind by this change in policy.For the most part, Americans connect to the internet through an ISP that they have a voluntary agreement with. The terms of this agreement can vary, but the Obama-era rules on net neutrality functioned to prevent large ISPs from using their control over our internet access to affect the flow of information.Net neutrality is the concept that all ISPs should treat all data traffic on a network indiscriminately. By requiring ISPs to treat all data the same, the net neutrality rules prevented ensured equal and open access to all internet users. For years, this issue has been a party-line debate over how, when, and by whom broadband providers should be regulated to ensure anti-discrimination practices. This is because regulators classify net neutrality under the Communications Act of 1934, an act created to regulate communications across different categories. Title I covers information services and Title II covers common carrier services. The primary difference between the two classifications is the FCC‚Äôs authority: Title I gives the FCC significant authority to regulate the ISPs and, Title II gives the FCC less control. Hence the drawing party-lines; Democrats tend to support Title I, while Republicans support Title II.In 2015, the Obama-era FCC passed the Open Internet Order, which placed strict regulations on ISPs to ensure they would treat all consumers fairly. It also classified ISPs under Title II, meaning that the FCC could regulate providers like they were phone companies, controlling prices charged to consumers. The rule was officially repealed by the FCC in June 2018, and in its place the agency created the Restoring Internet Freedom Order and Transparency Rule. This rule gave the FCC primary jurisdiction over ISP‚Äôs network management practices, and it also preempted states from enacting similar ISP network restrictions.Supporters of net neutrality believe that the government needs to play a role in restricting ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing the delivery of online content at their discretion and manage their network practices. Outside of legal regulation, demand-side pressures would be too weak to make a real difference in keeping ISPs from overcharging users or finding ways to control internet usage. Without net neutrality, companies can treat data transmission unequally. For example, Comcast ‚Äî which recently became part owner of video streaming service Hulu ‚Äî can lawfully block rival video streams, like Netflix. But why end net neutrality now, and what can we expect moving forward?The FCC, which is responsible for implementing America‚Äôs communications laws, ultimately answers to Congress. However, as an agency within the executive branch, the regulator has a great deal of discretion when it comes to interpreting internet and telephone service laws. And of course the current leadership at the FCC, which was appointed and heavily influenced by the Trump Administration, sees net neutrality as unnecessary government regulation over a market in which freedom of communication is critical to economic success.Those opposed to net neutrality rules support a Title II classification to limit the authority the FCC has over providers. They claim that the ISPs have no plans to block content or degrade the network‚Äôs performance and it would not be in the best interest of providers to slow down and block websites, as it could backfire on the companies‚Äô consumer base.The Justice Department assures internet users across the country that transparency rules will discourage providers from engaging in harmful practices, like censorship blocking and throttling. They argue that regulations that ban paid prioritization is economically inefficient. But lest we forget, these are businesses ‚Äî and utilities at that. Their interest is in profitability, and the shareholders come first. When this occurs, Pai argues, anti-competitive behavior can be dealt with by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instead. However, a lot of people are not buying what Pai is selling, and a ton of lawsuits and campaigns have come out against the end of net neutrality.Twenty-two of the fifty states, backed by major cities as well as tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Google‚Äôs Alphabet, have legally challenged the FCC‚Äôs decision. They argue that the FCC has abandoned its mandate to ensure free and open internet and become overpowered by the private interests they are meant to regulate. Of course, Telecommunications companies, like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon, have praised the FCC‚Äôs repeal.Of course, none of this really matters, as no ISP with the millions it dumps into its compliance department would dare make a move to restrict internet access until the dust settles in 2020. Not to mention that even despite the preemption issue, twenty-nine states have introduced 65 state-level net neutrality bills.In March 2019, Democrats presented the Save the Internet Act to the house floor with the goal of acting to prevent ISPs from using their power to manipulate how users experience the internet. The Act would rescind the 2017 FCC order to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order and prevent the FCC from changing the law in the future.Representative Nancy Pelosi, D-California, recently stated that 86% of the American population opposes the Trump administrations attack on net neutrality ‚Äî this also includes 82% of Republicans. In this manner, the Save the Internet Act is the Democratic parties way of honoring the wishes of the American people and encouraging innovation for smaller independent businesses. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt have the Senate‚Äôs support and is likely to die ‚Äî and even if it were to pass the Senate, the Trump administration guarantees a veto on the bill.To nobody‚Äôs surprise, federal lawmakers are wadding their knickers over the same argument they‚Äôve been having for over a decade now. But fortunately as federal lawmakers continue to toe the party line over net neutrality, progress continues at statehouses and court houses across the country.Since the federal government is busy with its own stuff, state lawmakers across the country have decided to take to their own measures to serve and protect their internet consumer constituents.California passed an act prohibiting ISPs from engaging in specified actions concerning the treatment of internet traffic. The state also adopted a resolution urging the FCC to reinstate the 2015 Open Internet Order and pressures Congress to intervene and protect net neutrality by codifying it federal statute. New Jersey took a similar approach, and Oregon recently prohibited public bodies from contracting with providers engage in paid prioritization, content blocking, or other discrimination. Vermont now requires providers to certify their noncompliance with consumer protection and net neutrality standards in order to be eligible to receive a government contract for their internet services. Washington also requires providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network‚Äôs management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of its services. And as free internet campaigns gain traction among grass-roots advocates, we are sure to see more and more of these types of laws come down.Although the FCC has succeeded in rolling back net neutrality rules, pending lawsuits and political red tape mean the future of net neutrality is still up in the air. Even more uncertain is how the rule changes will play out on the ground over time. Debate over internet regulations continue to be a hot topic among law makers. Many continue to uphold that net neutrality is an overreach of government regulations, while others argue that without these regulations, usage will be controlled by ISP monopolies ‚Äî such as Verizon and AT&T. But internet users understand that costs could begin to rise and their access can become more controlled by corporate if net neutrality isn‚Äôt put back in place. Thanks to progressive action on both the state and federal levels, Americans are still enjoying the freedoms of an open internet despite the lack of an effective national net",25/07/2019,0,0,5,0,1000,667,1,0,0,12,53
How To Fail Like A Superstar,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-fail-like-a-superstar-51e57ec558fe,Barry Davret,43000,5,995,"You never know what you‚Äôll get when you visit a comedy club. Sometimes you laugh so hard you lose control of your bladder. Other performances feel like you‚Äôre sitting through a rendition of the tax code.A comic knows when he‚Äôs blowing it; a silent audience is a reliable indicator. How did this comic handle his failure?It was our first trip to a comedy club in a decade. We enjoyed two of the acts. But one of them delivered an unfortunate unfunny performance. This comedian was blessed with a forgiving audience. Every so often you‚Äôd hear a pity chuckle; a laugh so obviously forced it sounded like a cough.He tried hard, maybe too hard. His jokes could have been funny, but he was nervous, often mumbling the punchline. At other times, he‚Äôd tap the top of the microphone with his palms for several seconds. It produced a loud popping sound uncomfortable for those of us seated near the speakers.There was one awful moment I thought he‚Äôd flee the stage in tears. But he fought through and finished his act. He exhaled, dropped his shoulders, and bowed slightly as he flashed a remorseful smile.He won our applause after he praised us for being a forgiving audience. His act fell short, but he powered through it and failed like a superstar.Not necessarily on stage but in life. Everyone gets on stage to perform. Your stage could be a ball field, a blog, a conference room, or a theater. It‚Äôs wherever you compete or display your work for others to judge. That‚Äôs your stage.How you compose yourself and act towards others at your worst says a lot about you as a person. Nobody will congratulate a winner for behaving with class and dignity. But we revere the defeated who muster the self-restraint to show class in defeat.In theory, it‚Äôs simple. Don‚Äôt throw a tantrum. Don‚Äôt give up because things aren‚Äôt going your way. Don‚Äôt blame anyone else for your failure. If competing against someone else, congratulate them on a well-fought competition.The rules of civilized behavior are simple, but sticking to those standards at the nexus of frustration challenges the best of us.It doesn‚Äôt matter what you call it: losing, failing, bombing. It always hurts. But you will reap benefits if you act with class, grace, and dignity.We watched a stand-up comic struggle. But he fought through his nerves and persevered. He even squeezed out a good joke towards the end. Did he really bang out a good laugh, or were we just rooting for him to score a winning moment? It doesn‚Äôt matter at this point.For his efforts, resolve, and dedication, he received an aggressive round of applause when he finished his act.If you‚Äôre a fan of individual sport competition like tennis or golf, you know the difference in respect you feel for someone who loses gracefully versus someone who throws a tantrum.You may not have rooted for the defeated player in the match, but he won your respect with his display of sportsmanship.You could be the leader of your team or a parent with your kid in the stands. They‚Äôre watching you. Remember that when you feel the urge to kick and scream when you lose.Be mindful of the example you set if you give up at the first sign of struggle.It‚Äôs easy to lose your temper or sulk when you fail to perform up to your standard.If you lose your shit, it gives an implicit okay for others to do the same. If you act with class and dignity, you set a standard for everyone else to follow.Failing like a superstar is not only about composing yourself in a dignified manner. It also means you dust yourself off, redouble your efforts, and take another shot.Abraham Lincoln battled through several failures before he became President. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. JK Rowling endured countless rejections.These stories have become folklore. It‚Äôs the recoveries after defeats that turn heroes into legends. We tell them over and over because they inspire us to forge ahead after setbacks. And there are always setbacks.As a teenager, I competed in local and regional tennis tournaments. I lost seventy-five percent of my matches. So, yeah, that was my education on losing.I never threw much of a fit in the blowouts, but in competitive matches, I was a terror when things didn‚Äôt go my way. I‚Äôd throw my racket, yell, curse, and accuse competitors of cheating.I awoke one morning after a meltdown and felt a deep humiliation over my actions. It was one of the reasons why I quit the sport. I thought that if I put myself in that position, I would embarrass myself again.Of course, a better solution might have been to just act with more dignity and grace in future competitions. Lesson learned as an adult.There was no internet back in my adolescent years, so my shameful behavior has been lost to the passage of decades.You can‚Äôt take that chance today.Someone will video your public meltdown ‚Äî it has become an addendum to Murphy‚Äôs Law. Throw a hissy fit, storm off stage, curse at the crowd, or berate a referee. It doesn‚Äôt matter what form your meltdown takes. It will find its way to social media channels and nag you every time you apply for a job or run for political office.You might hate yourself for blowing a big chance. You‚Äôll remember the pain of a stone-faced audience cringing at your dead jokes. You‚Äôll cry at the kind but crushing rejection letter that suggests you give up on your dream. Why try at all if the pain of failing beats you down?It‚Äôs a matter of realigning what‚Äôs most important. Tennis great, Arthur Ashe said it best.You‚Äôve got to get to a stage in life where going for it is more important than winning or losing ‚Äî Arthur AsheWhen going for it becomes your victory, you‚Äôll find it much easier to act like a superstar regardless of the outcome.",25/07/2019,1,0,0,1,1050,753,1,0,0,2,240

How to make bad decisions correctly,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-make-bad-decisions-correctly-69abed3544f9,Abinand Sivakumar,36,5,901,"They come in different flavors.Should I buy that car?Do I really need new shoes?Should I quit my job?Should I break up with him?Should I keep grinding?Decisions need to be made to do something. Decisions need to be made to stop doing some other things. Decisions need to be made to even not make a decision right now.Taking a few pointers from Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs stellar book ‚ÄúThinking, Fast and Slow‚Äù, the easiest decisions are the one‚Äôs we already made several times over a period of time. ‚ÄúWhat route to take to work?‚Äù involved a lot of thinking and planning the first time around, but subsequent commutes involve barely any mental effort. It is already ‚Äúin our gut‚Äù. The pattern that works is already soldered to our neural network.Situations and realizations that are new, trigger the logical thinker within ourselves. We have to work with limited knowledge of the consequences of our actions ‚Äî consequences that may be difficult to recover from. This post explores the faculties we have at our disposal to minimize regrets.Simply put, a bad decision is one that brings an outcome of regret.Consider having to choose between two courses of action. A classical ‚Äútwo roads diverged in a yellow wood‚Äù kind of a problem. We don‚Äôt know the result of either choice but we need to decide one in order to proceed. Now, no matter what was chosen, there is a 1/2 = 50% chance that we are going to regret it and 1/2 = 50% chance that we are going to be satisfied with it.Say there were more options. For a decision with three options, choosing one of them means we have 1/3 = 33% chance of being satisfied with it and 2/3= 66% chance of regretting it. Ouch! If we are presented with 10 options and have to choose one, well you get the idea ‚Äî 90% chance of regretting it.Does that mean having fewer options makes for a good decision? Yes and no, because in the real world, it is usually not obvious what options were available until after we choose one. That is why, even with meticulous planning and strategizing, the results would not exactly be what we wanted and we end up spewing a lot of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù after the fact.So we need more choices to pick the one we would be more satisfied with, but having more choices means that we make a decision we are more likely to regret. This seems like a setup for failure.The goal here is to be able to make bad decisions with confidence and use the experience of making those decisions to aid future decisions.There are plenty of ways to aid logical decision making ‚Äî read up on SWOT analysis, SCORE analysis, SOAR analysis, the Eisenhover matrix, etc and these are effective in various combinations for various personal or organizational needs but it is just one part of the decision making process. The strategies mentioned can be used to find what to choose but before this undertaking we need to refine the available options.This is where we tap into our instinctive experiences and brainstorm all the possibilities. We are going to create an artificial ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù from our automatic-action neural network.The way we can do this is not very different from learning a new concept or skill. The active logical thinking brain can only hold a little bit of information at any given time. The information gets assimilated into the passive brain by deliberate repetition. A simple exercise to that effect can be done by writing down the desired and undesired outcomes like this:By writing this down and reinforcing clearly what we want, what we don‚Äôt want and everything in between, the passive brain is facilitated to provide a decent set of options. The options that we ‚Äúbrainstorm‚Äù for ourselves would all be options that we can recover from even if it were bad ones. These options may not present themselves right away. It takes time to be processed. It may come as a form of inspiration when we are in the shower or while driving. They are subtle and fleeting so it is important to catch and pin thm when they appear. The clue for identifying such thoughts is that they appear to be triggered by an external cue, not very different from Archimedes‚Äô eureka from the bath water, but they bear a shadow of our reinforced specifications.At this point we end up with a set of choices. We could make a logical decision on those options with the resources available to us. The outcomes, even when they are not ideal, can be used to learn how to make the correct choice the next time.This worked for me in situations where I felt ‚Äústuck‚Äù with no alternatives and where no amount of logical thinking or rationalization could manifest a solution. Scouring through endless online Q&A posts on what the right thing to do is bound to end up in frustration. Some guy on the internet cannot give situational advice tailored to a specific need no matter how good that generic advice might seem. Not that there is a lack of positive intent, it is just not possible to communicate internal fears and aspirations that way. There is usually more than one way to attack a problem so that no matter what choice we make, it is either the satisfactory one or something that can be learned from.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,566,369,3,0,0,0,37
"The One Thing That Is Making Many of Us Anxious, Angry, And Stressed",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/lack-of-rest-6a6c7aff95c,Edith Tollschein,654,5,909,"The last time I went on vacation was 2 months ago. I am now back to my daily routines, but I am worn out. My concentration levels are below zero. I thought the 10-days break in May would help, but I am as tired as someone who hasn‚Äôt taken time off from work for the last 2 years.This got me thinking: How do other people take a break? How do other people rest and rejuvenate?And this is what I found out:Many of us do not know how to rest ‚Äî we do not know how to switch off completely and just chill.What I called resting was spending the whole day at the beach with my laptop working on a business plan. Brainstorming about my writing niches. Surfing online. Eating all the junk and drinking whatever I felt like. No wonder I am tired.Productivity hacks are selling the idea that even during rest, we somehow have to be productive; a misunderstanding that rest is purely physical.Our tea breaks have turned into a catch-up-with-emails time.This culture of constant self-improvement is harming us. We are walking around believing we are not good enough because we‚Äôve not attained XYZ ‚Äî thanks to productivity podcasts that we listen to any time we have some spare time to rest.We are oblivious to the fact that rest requires much more than physical rest ‚Äî mental and emotional rest are equally important.Gallup‚Äôs annual Global Emotions report shows that people all over the world are more stressed than ever before.Global levels of stress, worry, sadness and pain are hitting new highs.Quotes like ‚ÄúI will sleep when I am dead‚Äù have become our daily mantra.We are constantly reminded that our bodies are weak and should be pushed. When we are tired, we take a shot of espresso or drink some red bull and continue.We even think we are lucky when our employers provide energy drinks and coffee at the office.Our bodies have become the enemy. The less we sleep the better. I mean, we get to do more work than others ‚Äî the question is ‚Äî and then what?What are we chasing? Is the money ever enough. Is a big house ever big enough? Is our health not a priority anymore?Thanks to social media ‚Äî the struggle to keep up with the Joneses has escalated, we are now striving to keep up with every new post that shows up on our timelines.Hustle culture, with tags like #bossmoves #millionairemindset #grind #hustle #gobigorgohome are all over the internet.And if you are not in the game, you are a loser.Rest ‚Äî a simple human need, is now confused with laziness.If you dare take some time off to simply do nothing; you must lack ambition. Or you are a spoilt brat. Or you are just lazy.We are constantly telling ourselves that we need to improve on XYZ. If it is not our physical appearance, then it is our career, if it is not our career then it is our relationships, and it goes on.This has led many of us to believe that we are not good enough. We have become addicted to self-improvement, forgetting that there is no end to this game.Being alive means, there will always be room for improvement in various aspects of our lives.To set ourselves free from this madness, we have to learn to rest amid life‚Äôs chaos.When it comes to our goals; why have we allowed our mental and physical health to take a back seat?We overwork ourselves at the expense of our mental and physical health to make more money, then we spend that money on meds to regain our health back. Isn‚Äôt this madness?Stress, worry, and anger have become the new norm. We have accepted that this is how life is.Happiness and peace should be our main priorities, but somehow, we have been brainwashed to believe that we should not be happy ‚Äî if we do not have the latest iPhone. If we‚Äôve not attained #bodygoals. If we have not travelled to exotic countries. If we do not wake up at 5 a.m. to do god knows what.We are applauded for working 60 hours per week; 40 hours work weeks is for losers.Studies demonstrate that the mind obliquely solves tough problems while daydreaming ‚Äî an experience many people have had while taking a shower. Epiphanies may seem to come out of nowhere, but they are often the product of unconscious mental activity during downtime.Research on naps, meditation, nature walks and the habits of exceptional artists and athletes reveals how mental breaks increase productivity, replenish attention, solidify memories and encourage creativity.Rest is as important as food. It is as important as hydration. It is as important as hard work.So, when planning your day, rest should be included in the plan.Rest requires patience, you cannot rush your resting time because you have a #sidehustle.Our problem is that we think we have to earn a rest. When our body tells us we need a break, we silence it with coffee or whatever.We are waiting for everything to be perfect before we rest.We‚Äôve been sold this lie that once we attain the modern society‚Äôs version of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù, we will feel good about ourselves.There is no way we can be happy when we are exhausted emotionally, mentally and physically.How about you just start resting because it makes you feel good?Resting to feel good is a good enough reason, and feeling good should be at the top of our goals in life!",25/07/2019,4,0,15,6,1050,700,1,0,0,8,446

Offices, a foundry (so he could control the quality of his sculptures), a large studio with north light, a temperature-controlled underground storage space for his original waxes. We had chickens whose eggs went into the egg tempera of his paints, and horses who served as models for his sculptures.We‚Äôd been married ten years when my body went broke. All my self-sustaining resources vanished.I had three children under the age of five, and I was up at 5:30 a.m., getting them ready for their day. At around 8:30, our housekeeper Angela would arrive and begin moving around the kitchen, smoothing down the energy spikes, humming at the ghosts of imbalance, ushering them out the back door and into the yard and away. Soon, Fiats rolled up the driveway, secretaries opened the offices, and the foundry workers arrived. Metal hammers on bronze competed with radio DJs and their machine gun Italian narrative.I took Luke and Jesse (then two and four) to the nursery school, and our baby Chloe would toddle around the house most of the day with me, or with Angela.At 9:30 a.m., Harry would get up. I worked with him all day, writing letters, transcribing his journals, implementing directives. Every move he made had to be recorded, sometimes videotaped, then archived. My function was also to buffer his bombastic outbursts, to smooth ruffled feathers, to spin his gaffes. I roamed the offices and the foundry, monitoring progress, checking that everyone was okay. Harry napped whenever he felt like it. I could not.The kids came home in the afternoon. If I wanted to take them somewhere fun, it was always, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt Angela do that?‚Äù I juggled time with my children and time with Harry until dinner. Once the kids were asleep, it was back to work. And as late as everyone else stayed (often way past 9 p.m.), I ached with bitterness when they went home. My second shift was just beginning.In those days (the early ‚Äô80s), it was much cheaper to make your international phone calls after 11 p.m., so Harry waited until then to do business with our contacts in the States, (in time zones that were six to nine hours earlier). He was infamous for his verbal stamina. A very brief call lasted about an hour. Most were two hours, sometimes three. My job was to be there, witness, and take notes. He didn‚Äôt want me to say anything. Sometimes I felt important. Mostly, I just felt a dogged sense of servitude.I didn‚Äôt complain. That would only trigger what could become a lengthy session of either rage or his version of psychotherapy‚Ä¶he had a way of making me feel sick and brave and interesting and greedy and selfish all at the same time. So, yeah. Not about to complain. If all went well, I was in bed by 2 a.m., but usually it was 3 a.m. And then it all began again at 5:30.After many months of this, I began showing signs of deterioration. Once, Angela found me lying on the kitchen floor. It had seemed like a lovely idea at the time. Later, someone found me wandering in my pajamas on the main road near our house, just muttering to myself. It was decided I should no longer leave the property unless someone was with me. I began feeling trapped, and tried several times unsuccessfully to sneak out.We were getting ready for bed one night, and he said to me quietly, without any problem in his voice, ‚ÄúDoes this place feel like a prison to you?‚Äù Relief spread through my whole body. A warming, an opening. He had seen into my thoughts, and now we could talk about it. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, and like lightning, his fist shot into my belly. I didn‚Äôt say any more, while he explained to me why this place was not a prison. It was a fucking castle.The next morning, I told myself, Don‚Äôt engage. Just get through the day. I got up and tended to the kids. Angela picked them up and drove them to the nursery school. I was in the kitchen making coffee, getting breakfast together, reminding myself, Just get through the day.He came downstairs. I didn‚Äôt acknowledge him, kept my mind on my immediate task. Breakfast. He was talking to me like nothing had happened. I remained mute, neutral. Finally, he said, ‚ÄúWhat crawled up your ass and died?‚Äù (Do not take the bait.) I continued with my task, willing myself to keep moving. Robotically setting the table, handling things carefully, not setting anything down with too much force, lest I trigger another event.He got in front of me then, right in my face, and said, ‚ÄúYou know what? I‚Äôm glad I did what I did last night. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have ulcers.‚Äù My eyeballs went numb. I moved away from him, calmly turned the fire off under the hissing coffee, walked toward the shelves where we stored our dishes, then took a whole stack of plates and smashed them down on the terracotta tiles.He laughed tenderly, as though encouraging a child. ‚ÄúGood! Good for you. Blow the soot out!‚ÄùRage upon rage. Now, with every flying plate I was only ‚Äî still ‚Äî doing his will.I broke everything anyway. Every cup, every dish, glass, bowl, everything. And then a delicious idea took shape: our big Thanksgiving platter sailing through the air and smashclattering through the kitchen window. We were now ankle deep in crockery, and he chuckled about how this is what I needed all along.I screamed at him incoherently and ran out of the house, tearing down the long driveway, past the offices and the foundry ‚Äî till I got to the gate, where either someone buzzes you through, or you have to turn the key in the little box to open it. Then it opened at a snail‚Äôs pace, so you knew Someone Very Important lived there. I hated that gate. Fumbling desperately with the key, I struggled with someone as they prevented my escape. By now Harry and four or five of the foundry men had caught up to me. I gave up.In silence, we made the death march back toward the house. Everyone kept a safe distance. For a moment, I felt powerful. They were scared of me.As we entered the house, out of the corner of my eye I saw the kitchen floor, covered with pieces of me, bits of white foam on the choppy waters of my dissolving sanity. I ended up with my back to the fireplace, surrounded by Harry, his secretary, his foreman, and a couple other people. Angela came in and surveyed the damage, eyes wide.Someone called a doctor.My time in the Italian sanatorium restored my health. I got plenty of sleep. I was well fed. But it took eight more years before I‚Äôd have the courage to leave my husband. This is because just as I was recovering (it took about four months), his director of sales in Wyoming moved away, and someone had to take her place. I was the only one who knew his body of work well enough to do it. I jumped at the chance. My new position gave us a good eight years on slightly more equal footing. But our dynamic was still so destructive that eventually, I had to leave.Harry has his own story, his own hells that hounded him. He suffered unspeakable trauma in World War II at the battle of Tarawa, which no doubt exacerbated whatever he went through as a very young boy at the hands of his sadistic father. And he had tenderness and wisdom and a wonderful sense of humor, none of which is featured in this story. He was a human being, after all, so all of his good qualities were in the soup with the scary ones.His accomplishments are well documented. Go to harryjacksonstudios.com or find yourself a copy of the gorgeous art book Harry Jackson, by Donald Goddard and Larry Pointer. The work is stunning. He challenged the art world in unparalleled ways. In response to being screwed repeatedly by the gallery system, he managed to create a direct relationship between himself and his collectors. No one had ever even attempted such a thing.When we fell in love, I was eighteen. He was forty-nine. After our almost twenty-year marriage ended in divorce, we were estranged for decades. His life ended in a Veteran‚Äôs hospital at the age of eighty-six having died the same way he lived ‚Äî on his own terms. He simply stopped eating.The gift he left behind was his art. But the gift he gave to me was my backbone. I found it by standing up to him. That was my karma. I‚Äôm sorry for my children‚Äôs sake that I didn‚Äôt do it sooner, but I did finally do it. I thought the measure of my love was how long I could stand in the fire that was burning my house down. But that‚Äôs not it. The measure of any love is how free you can be to flourish in another‚Äôs presence.Twenty-seven years after leaving him, I‚Äôm astounded by my blessings, not least of which is my grandson, who kicks his little leg in the air as I hold onto the other, blowing raspberries into his foot. His smile ends all further plans for the day. I‚Äôm a singer/songwriter, and have released three CDs. I married my best friend in the world, I got my MFA in Musical Theatre Writing at NYU, one of my musicals (written with Elise Forier-Edie) was published, others have been produced, I‚Äôve created close to fifty quilts, I‚Äôm a certified 500-hour yoga teacher, and I‚Äôve written the first draft of a novel.None of which would have happened if I‚Äôd burned down with the house.But getting out in time is different than getting out intact. Thank God for therapy and Refuge Recovery meetings, and the thousand points of light (the ocean, trees, music, words, friends) that have carried me forward into healing. The work of becoming whole continues till we die.If you find yourself at a breaking point, perhaps at the point of breaking things for real, I hope you‚Äôll get out sooner than I did. Believe in your better life. It really is inside you, waiting to be set free.Take a deep breath, and set it free.Tina Lear is a writer, composer/lyricist, yoga teacher, and mother of three really interesting humans.

Delivering Great Customer Service,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/delivering-great-customer-service-a53d39f738fc,Donna Cosky,38,9,2059,"It was Sunday, my day off. One of only 2 days to decompress and get all of my personal things done. The phone rang. It was an attorney from my firm calling because she couldn‚Äôt log on to our network from her home. I couldn‚Äôt see her screen to see what she was doing, so I tried the usual troubleshooting techniques to solve the problem, but they didn‚Äôt work. I couldn‚Äôt be sure if it was what she was doing or a true technical problem.I knew her well enough to know that she wasn‚Äôt a whiz with computers. Finally, she told me that when her husband got home she‚Äôd have him call me since he was more familiar with computers.A minute after we hung up, my phone rang again. It was her again. She started telling me how frustrated she was because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. I was so stunned I didn‚Äôt say anything. I realized that she didn‚Äôt know she was talking to ME. She thought she had called another attorney to complain. Finally, I asked her if she knew who she was talking to. She paused, realizing what she‚Äôd done. Then she started apologizing.After we hung up the second time, I thought about how to act at work the next day. Her office was right across from mine, so I couldn‚Äôt avoid her. It upset me that someone who I thought liked me both professionally and personally would talk about me like that.I decided that all I could do was accept her apology, tell her that I realized that she was frustrated, and that I knew these things happened. I made a mental note not to tell her anything too personal in the future. Then I let it go.I did this for several reasons. First, what else could I really do? Make a big deal of it and be uncomfortable at work every day?Second, since part of my job was technical support for our office, it was my job to help everyone with any technical problems. Therefore my coworkers were also my clients.No matter what kind of business you‚Äôre in, there is always a client/customer. Whatever you call them, making sure they‚Äôre satisfied should be one of your top priorities. This may seem obvious, but I‚Äôve been surprised by the managers I‚Äôve had who didn‚Äôt place a priority on this. Ego gets in the way of good customer service. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about‚Äù, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a jerk‚Äù, ‚Äúthey just need to do what we tell them‚Äù.The statements above may all be true, but if you want to keep your clients satisfied, they don‚Äôt matter. We all know that the customer isn‚Äôt always right, but if you do customer service well, they‚Äôll feel that their problems matter, and that makes most people happy.I‚Äôve had a variety of jobs and I‚Äôve managed to get most clients to like me, or at least to think that I did a good job. Here are a few things I‚Äôve picked up over the years.Listen To PeopleDon‚Äôt be that person who just waits for a break in the conversation so they can talk. Don‚Äôt ignore what clients are telling you because you think you already know what they need.I assume that you can‚Äôt read minds, so this is your best way to find out what you need to know to make your clients and yourself happy.One of the most important skills to have is reading people.Is the person someone who likes to chat, or are they transactional? If they‚Äôre friendly and like small talk, showing an interest in them and their life goes a long way toward getting them to like you. If they‚Äôre transactional, they may find that annoying. They want their problem solved and that‚Äôs all. Very often what kind of person they are will change depending on how much pressure they‚Äôre under.When I worked at law firms people were more often transactional. Lawyers are often trying to meet a quota for billable hours, they have to get documents in by a court deadline, or they have to respond to opposing counsel. In a service setting like when I waited tables, people can be either, but many are more social. My regular customers liked to tell me a little about themselves, the movie they just saw, where they worked, and so on.What Is Most Important To Them?A lot of companies lump all their customers together, assuming that they all have the same priorities because they want the same product. It‚Äôs okay to have a general sense of what your group of customers wants or needs, but if you can get to know them as individuals you can meet individual needs.Some of my clients had no patience for ‚Äúlengthy‚Äù troubleshooting. If you couldn‚Äôt fix a problem in 2‚Äì3 minutes, they would get irritated (or worse).If they were trying to meet a deadline, I did whatever I could to fix their problem fast, even if it wasn‚Äôt perfect. Sometimes that meant I‚Äôd print their document or make formatting changes so they could get it out the door. I‚Äôd explain that I needed to do a few more things to fix their computer and that I‚Äôd be glad to do it when they were at lunch or had left for the day.This allowed me to do my job without someone pressuring me, and they got their problem fixed without spending precious non-billable time waiting for me. Some tech people would think editing a document was ‚Äúbelow‚Äù them. I think that attitude is a mistake. If it only takes a minute of your time, why not do it to make your client happy?Figure Out If They Have Pet Peeves Or QuirksThis was one of the best things I‚Äôve ever learned to do. Every workplace has employees that are ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù. No one likes dealing with them. Since I‚Äôm a perfectionist and a people pleaser, this type of person used to scare the crap out of me. I couldn‚Äôt avoid them forever, though, so I tried to figure out why they were difficult.One partner would send us long emails telling us what his problem was in detail. He knew more about technology than the average attorney, so you couldn‚Äôt bullshit him. He told us how much he charged per hour, and that he shouldn‚Äôt be wasting his valuable time troubleshooting software. This type of behavior normally gets eye rolls in IT departments. Since we develop, install, and support software, we can get defensive when people criticize it. But that mentality didn‚Äôt help me or him.I changed my approach to him by addressing each thing he told us, because these things were obviously important to him. I told him that I knew he was busy, so I‚Äôd make it quick. I knew that he resented the firm telling him that he had to have a standard software setup on his personal laptop, so I didn‚Äôt change things on his laptop any more than I had to.Also, when the firm was voting on which office suite to buy, he wanted Word Perfect. The committee went with Microsoft Office. He didn‚Äôt like it, so he pointed out every problem he had with Microsoft products.So when we talked I‚Äôd tell him that yes, he had indeed found yet another problem with Word. I‚Äôd insinuate that it frustrated me, too. I never, ever tried to fool him by lying about the cause of his problem or anything. I knew that he knew bullshit when he heard it. After a while, he started sending his emails directly to me. Years later when I put in my two week‚Äôs notice, he called me to ask why I was leaving, and if I‚Äôd reconsider.Flatter PeopleThere are very few people who don‚Äôt like flattery. Listen to your clients & figure out what they take pride in. Find that thing and find a way to mention it. For the ‚Äútechnical gurus‚Äù who told me they knew a lot about computers, I would acknowledge their knowledge. I‚Äôd say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôre better with Windows than most, this is a bug that we just found out about and we need to get it fixed. Do you want me to give you instructions or just fix it for you?‚ÄùThis acknowledged that they knew their stuff, it gave them ‚Äúinside‚Äù information, and it gave them a choice of how to resolve their problem.Think Of How You Would Feel If You Were In Their PositionWe‚Äôve all had times when something went wrong & we‚Äôve had to ask for help. We‚Äôve also all probably dealt with rude or apathetic customer service people. How did you feel? How would you feel if you were in your customer‚Äôs place, having the knowledge that they have?Being empathic goes a long way toward having a good relationship with a client. I‚Äôve had bosses who couldn‚Äôt remember what it was like when they didn‚Äôt know a lot about a product. They gave instructions to people with the assumption that those people were on the same knowledge level as them.Whenever possible, imagine being in your client‚Äôs place. They have to deal with you. Make that as seamless and pleasant as possible.Some clients would tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a computer person‚Äù. I could tell most felt slightly embarrassed or frustrated that they couldn‚Äôt fix their problem themselves. My reply was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not your job, it‚Äôs mine. You‚Äôve got more important things to do‚Äù.Pick Your BattlesWhen I taught software classes, some people didn‚Äôt want to be there. Their company wanted them to learn more about a software package, so they paid for training and required all employees to go. I could usually tell who these students were because they didn‚Äôt look at me. They were busy playing games on their computer.In this case, THEY were my customer. They were the ones who filled out my evaluation at the end of class. I decided that if they wanted to play games, that was their choice. As long as they didn‚Äôt disrupt my class by asking questions because they hadn‚Äôt been paying attention, I left them alone. If I had continually stopped teaching to comment on their lack of attention, it would distract the rest of the class.Stand Up For Yourself When You Have ToSome people are simply rude, stupid, careless, or irritating. None of us should have to deal with abuse by customers or co-workers. The important thing is knowing what crosses the line from annoying to abusive. Some things are obvious (sexual harrassment, physical abuse, personal insults). For others it‚Äôs a matter of personality and perspective. Cover your ass if you can. Before you say something that will result in a client problem, talk to your boss or Human Resources.At one of my jobs there was a paralegal who just didn‚Äôt like me. I tried everything I could think of, but none of it made her like me.One night she got angry and told me that I didn‚Äôt know how to do my job (after four years). She went on and on with insults. It was after-hours and my boss had left for the day. I told her that I realized that she didn‚Äôt like me, and I was sorry that we were having a problem. I admitted my part in the problem and offered to do what I could to help. That was it. Someone else was in her office so I had a witness.The next day I went to my boss and told her what happened. I told her what I said. She told me that she knew this person could be difficult, and she had no problem with what I said. By being direct with my boss I‚Äôd avoided a day of worry about what might be said about me.We all get angry, hurt, and frustrated. We might be tired or having a bad day. It would be nice if all of our clients thought of these things, but they don‚Äôt.If we put the effort in to meet their needs, we‚Äôve done our part. Hopefully your boss will hear what a great experience the clients had with you, or your clients will tell other potential clients. If nothing else, you‚Äôll know that when it comes to this part of your job, you‚Äôve done your best. Your pride in a job well done should be worth the effort.",25/07/2019,5,0,0,8,1050,1575,1,0,0,2,207
Be on the Lookout for Business Email Compromise Scams,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/be-on-the-lookout-for-business-email-compromise-scams-7a7d3efef06e,Teresa Rothaar,299,4,736,"Last July, the FBI reported that global losses from business email compromise (BEC) scams, also known as email account compromise and CEO fraud, had shot past $12 billion. The year 2018 alone ended with over $1.2 billion in losses to BEC, nearly double the figure for 2017.BEC scams are alive, well, and continuously evolving. A new report by the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit of the U.S. Department of Treasury, estimates that U.S. companies are being drained of $301 million per month. The agency found that while hackers once preferred to impersonate c-level executives ‚Äî hence the nickname ‚ÄúCEO fraud‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre now posing as vendors or business associates.BEC is an equal opportunity cyber scam; companies of all sizes and in all industries can fall victim. With over half of employees admitting to not following email security policies, it‚Äôs easy to understand why hackers love them some BEC.This is not your father‚Äôs phishing schemeBEC is a form of phishing. However, unlike ‚Äútraditional‚Äù phishing emails, which consist of (usually very poorly written) form letters mass-emailed to everyone and their brother, BEC scams are highly organized and sophisticated, and emails are sent to only a few carefully selected targets in specific organizations. Before launching a scam, hackers take time to conduct cyber reconnaissance, collecting information from company websites and social media networks.The actual emails may be sent from a spoofed email address or the sender‚Äôs actual email account, the credentials having been stolen in a separate cyber attack. Rather than trying to get the target to click on a link or download a file, BEC scams try to get them to take some sort of action and warn of dire consequences should they not follow the instructions in the email. Here are some common examples.The past-due invoice scamFinCEN reports that fraudulent vendor invoices are now the most popular BEC method, accounting for 39% of attempts. The victim receives an email that appears to be from a trusted vendor or (less frequently) a high-ranking company executive containing an urgent request for a wire transfer to pay a seriously past-due invoice, a very realistic-looking forgery of which may be attached. Thinking the request is legitimate, the victim sends the wire transfer, which goes into an account controlled by the hacker.The W2/tax data scamThis is a very popular scam during tax season in the U.S. It works much like a past-due invoice scam, only instead of posing as a vendor with a past-due invoice, the hacker impersonates the company‚Äôs payroll service. Copies of all employees‚Äô tax information are needed immediately, the email says, to send out their W2 forms.The gift cards for clients scamThis is a newer type of BEC scam that is very popular around the Christmas holidays. The hacker impersonates the victim‚Äôs boss, or even that person‚Äôs boss, claiming to be in urgent need of gift cards for very important clients. The victim needs to drop what they are doing, purchase hundreds or thousands of dollars in gift cards, and email the card codes to the ‚Äúboss‚Äù ASAP.Yes, this scheme can and does work. Stu Sjouwerman, CEO & Founder of KnoweB4, recounted the tale of one unfortunate soul who drove all over town, charging $2,000 in iTunes gift cards to her personal credit card, because she thought a company executive had instructed her to do so.Real Estate ScamsAccording to the FBI, the real estate sector is being hammered by BEC, with attempts skyrocketing by 1100% in two years. In this flavor of BEC scam, a participant in a real estate transaction receives an email that appears to be from another participant, instructing them to change the type and/or location of a payment. The email may be followed up with a phone call to add legitimacy. The money ends up getting deposited in a hacker-controlled account, which is quickly drained.Preventing your company from falling victimTechnical defenses against BEC include implementing the DMARC security protocol to prevent spoofing and following email security best practices to prevent credentials theft.However, the best defenses against BEC aren‚Äôt technical. Employee cyber security awareness training is crucial, as are process fail safes and redundancy. Companies should require that employees receive verification and authorization from more than one person before sending wire transfers or sensitive information, such as employee tax data. The FBI advises participants in real estate transactions to establish secret ‚Äúcode words‚Äù to verify that each party is who they say they are.",25/07/2019,0,0,6,0,1050,559,1,0,0,8,95
Negativity is Better For You‚Ä¶Duh.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/negativity-is-better-for-you-duh-be04146d4794,Ari Meisel,4300,3,657,"Trailblazers, game-changers, paradigm-shifters, or whatever trendy descriptor of the week you want to use, are inherently high-efficiency people. The kind of people who accomplish more in a day than most accomplish in a week. These are the type of people I not only work with but who also populate my team.My business is innovation; a company where efficiency is more than our unique talent, it is what makes us all happily replaceable. We‚Äôre a team of insatiable learners and problem solvers who lean-in and learn fast so we can find the focus, flexibility, and freedom to do what we want when we want.We also don‚Äôt thrive on positive reinforcement.And hey, turns out that might not be a bad thing.I learned this lesson well at my old company, a virtual assistant platform.We did an exercise called Ritual Dissent where we broke up into groups of five. One person in each group had one minute to pitch an idea to improve the company. It was followed by two minutes of feedback from the other four people in that group. The tweaks were that the feedback could only be negative and the person giving the pitch had to wear a mask to depersonalize the feedback.At the end of the two minutes, the person with the idea rotated to the next group. Once they had pitched and refined their idea through all six groups they pitched their idea to me. The results were astounding. Thirty people were given the chance to pitch ideas after going through five iterations of only negative feedback and the results were astounding.We got eleven game-changing ideas from the team that we implemented with massive impact.Once we finished the ritual dissent exercise I decided to ‚Äúturn the camera on me.‚Äù I put on the mask and sat in front of all thirty members of the team and said ‚ÄúTake the next five minutes and only give me negative feedback, no hold barred, no consequences‚ÄùIt was really scary, and that‚Äôs what made it so impactful.The best piece of feedback I got was that I needed to spend more time teaching people instead of simply providing them with the answer.Truth.I‚Äôm still working on that, but I also have enormous faith in the people I coach and the people on my team, so when I employ ‚Äútough love‚Äù on them, the results are usually better than I could have hoped.I‚Äôm learning to teach in a different way. I‚Äôm learning that negative support and feedback can be the very best kind if used correctly.Here‚Äôs an example:Amy, our Creative Director, started with us as a self-professed ‚Äúneo-Luddite‚Äù. She could write solid copy for me but was terrified of the technology we use in our business.So I would send her tech platforms to use in her work and tell everyone else on the team, not to help her. AT ALL. Initially, this made her even more unsteady, but it worked. She dove in and mastered the subtleties of analytics and simple coding like a boss.After one such successful exercise, I finally told her, ‚ÄúAmy, people much smarter than you, created these platforms, you couldn‚Äôt break anything, I just wanted you to get in there and see what you could do; to take ownership of the discovery instead of having someone hold your hand.‚ÄùI knew she was smart, I knew she was curious and I knew she wanted to learn. I just had to establish a constrictive, somewhat negative environment for her to flourish in.If I had told her all those things before she began, she would not have had the drive to figure it out on her own.It was kind of like when the good witch tells Dorothy at the end of the Wizard of Oz, that she always had the power to get herself home, and if she had told her any earlier, she wouldn‚Äôt have believed her.Tough conversations need to happen. It‚Äôs a good thing because being uncomfortable makes us grow.",25/07/2019,0,0,5,0,1050,699,1,1,0,7,24
Spending Dollars Chasing Pennies,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/spending-dollars-chasing-pennies-c2e9228cf727,Kimberley Anglesey,3,4,770,"Keep more money in your pocket by wasting less time.A savvy small business owner recognizes the importance of pinching pennies, watching the bottom line, keeping over head costs under control. Proper money management is the foundation of success. It can easily be the difference between staying in business and joining the 30% of companies who fail in the first year.Of course, multiple things can cause a small business to fail. Sometimes it‚Äôs a poor understanding of the market. Sometimes it‚Äôs a lack of planning, or a bad location, or online competition. Even growing too quickly can be the death of a business. All of these are relevant concerns. But one issue small business owners often overlook is cost effective time management. Time is money after all. Through the years I have witnessed small business owners spend dollars chasing pennies.What do I mean by that? Allow me to illustrate with real life examples of business owners throwing away money when they became fixated on saving a buck.Once upon a time, I worked as an operations manager for a small business that sold mobile filing systems. During a slow period, cash flow was a problem, and we looked for ways to tighten the budget. My boss thought she could save money by reducing the foreman‚Äôs per diem by $10 a day. The company did system installations around the country, and crews traveled frequently. It seemed reasonable to her that saving $10 per day would add up over time, and improve the cash flow.Unfortunately, she failed to take into consideration the negative reaction of the employee. By shifting a portion of the financial burden to the foreman, the owner lost the respect of the employee. His willingness to leave his family and travel for work was a sacrifice. By lowering his per diem, he felt unappreciated. Resentment soon set in. Instead of keeping all crew members working at the proper pace, he wasn‚Äôt motivated to ensure everyone‚Äôs best performance, and jobs took longer to complete.Those extra man hours on a job cost the company far more than $10 a day. Occasionally, the crew stayed an entire day over budget, wracking up hotel expenses, wages, per diem, and taxes. Recognizing the problem, I strongly urged the owner to restore the foreman‚Äôs per diem rate. She refused. She was blindly determined to hold on to the $10. Her decision cost the company thousands of dollars in the end.At another job, I had a boss who was outraged over a fee, and refused to pay the vendor $22. He had me drive to the vendor‚Äôs office three times to resolve the matter before it was settled. My wage was more than $22 per hour, and I spend more than two hours on the issue, plus the cost of mileage. When you include payroll taxes, he paid approximately $75 to save $22.These are both examples of emotional decisions. Not sound business decisions. When running your business, you must set emotion aside, and be sure all decisions make good financial sense.There are other areas where an owner must consider time investment when establishing business practices. For example, I often teach bookkeeping to new hires with the express focus on performing tasks using the most efficient method, while still maintaining accurate books. Accounting is a meticulous activity. Reconciling bank statements is frequently a place where people will devote significant time trying to find every penny.While accuracy is important, how much time should anyone devote to achieving zero discrepancy? Remember, time is money. Finding tiny differences can be time consuming. Receipts may come in without a tip added on the cardholder copy. There may be typos in entered transactions. Even the rare bank error may happen.How do you decide between perfection in accounting, versus wasting too much time reconciling? Consider the cost of the time being spent. I have a simple rule of thumb. If the difference in the bank statement and the books is less than a dollar, do not spend a single minute looking for it. Simply enter an adjustment and move on. Allow a few minutes searching for dollars. Scale up the time spent reconciling according to the dollar amount out of balance. The same kind of evaluation should go into every decision where time is being invested.As a small business owner, you must continuously weigh costs versus benefit, whether it be wages, customer good will, maximizing buying power with vendors, or balancing your books to the penny. If you want to be in the 25% of businesses who make it past the 15 year mark, don‚Äôt be one of those owners who spends dollars chasing pennies.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,1050,700,1,0,0,0,41
Two Cheers for Joe Biden‚Äôs Healthcare Plan,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/two-cheers-for-joe-bidens-healthcare-plan-99e0375f32db,Ed Dolan,1500,6,1430,"On July 15, presidential candidate Joe Biden released a plan for reforming the health care system. The plan attempts the difficult task of guaranteeing affordable health care for all while minimizing disruption of the current system. Rather than rebuilding the U.S. health care system from the ground up, it leaves most of its major components, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and employer-sponsored insurance, in place. Despite its caution, it could, if well implemented, represent a real step forward.Details are sketchy, but here are some key elements of the plan, based on the initial outline provided by Biden‚Äôs campaign.A public optionThe centerpiece of the Biden plan is a Medicare-like public option for people seeking individual coverage on the ACA exchanges. The intention is to provide ‚Äúa more affordable option for many Americans who today find their health insurance too expensive.‚Äù It would be offered as an alternative to private insurance, which would remain available.There is a certain logic to a public-private mixed strategy. If it were done right, the public option would set up a competitive dynamic on the ACA exchanges similar to the one that now exists between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. If private networks were too narrow or if insurers were too aggressive in denying legitimate claims, consumers could turn to the public option. If the public option turned out to be too bureaucratic, if it paid such low rates that it failed to attract quality providers, or if it imposed long waiting times, people would spurn it in favor of private plans.Income-based premium subsidiesThe Biden plan would enhance premium subsidies for insurance purchased on ACA exchanges. Subsidies would be calculated on the basis of a gold plan, that is, a plan with an actuarial value of 80 percent, rather than a silver plan with an AV of 70 percent, as at present. They would be scaled so that premiums would consume no more than 8.5 percent of family income. Currently only families and individuals with incomes less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for premium subsidies; that cap would be lifted.The brief outline supplied by the Biden campaign does not address possible changes to the cost sharing reductions that are available to reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income households who purchase silver plans on the ACA exchanges. Presumably, those would continue, perhaps with enhancements.For example, consider the approach to cost sharing reductions described in a proposal called the Healthy America Program, prepared by Linda J. Blumberg, John Holahan, and Stephen Zuckerman for the Urban Institute. That program would provide cost sharing reductions sufficient to fully cover out-of-pocket costs for households at or below 100 percent of the poverty level. The out-of-pocket limit would gradually rise for higher-income families until they reached an actuarial value of 80 percent. Although the outline of the Biden plan does not specifically endorse the Healthy America Program, it does provide a link to it and clearly draws on it in many respects.Employer-sponsored health insuranceAlmost half of all Americans get their health insurance coverage through their jobs. Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI) is a unique and much-criticized feature of the U.S. health care system. Despite the fact that many people are satisfied with their coverage, ESHI is a source of ‚Äújob lock‚Äù which makes many people afraid to make a career move to a better job or start a business of their own for fear of losing insurance coverage. It is inequitable, providing far greater benefits to high-income employees than to those with lower wages or part-time jobs. And the existence of thousands of employer plans, many of them very small, contributes to excessive fragmentation of the health care system and high administrative costs.The Biden plan does not make a direct attack on ESHI. It leaves its tax deductibility (the source of much of its inequity) intact. However, it does make one important change. Currently, individual workers who turn down offers of employer-sponsored insurance and instead purchase policies on the ACA exchanges are not eligible for premium assistance or cost-sharing reductions. The Biden plan would eliminate that restriction. Individual workers who opted out of ESHI would receive the same income-based subsidies as everyone else.MedicaidThe Biden plan retains Medicaid as the primary vehicle for delivering health care to people with low incomes. The 36 states that participate in expanded Medicaid under the ACA would be allowed to continue their current programs or could instead switch coverage to the new public option, provided they continued to pay their current share of the costs. In the 14 states that have not offered expanded coverage, low-income residents would be eligible for zero-premium coverage under the new public option.The Biden plan would also introduce a limited version of automatic enrollment in the public option for low-income families who interact with public institutions in certain ways, for example, students in public schools and families receiving food stamp benefits.Cleaning up the Biden planIn many ways, the Biden plan resembles an approach to health care reform that goes under the generic name of universal catastrophic coverage (UCC). The basic idea of UCC is to provide everyone with protection from financially ruinous medical expenses while asking those who can afford it to pay a fair share of the costs of their own care through income-based premiums and out-of-pocket costs. However, because it leaves so much of the current dysfunctional system in place, the Biden plan implements the UCC concept in an incomplete and cumbersome fashion. It could benefit greatly from some cleanup and simplification.First, instead of introducing a public option that is ‚Äúlike Medicare,‚Äù the public option and traditional Medicare should be fully integrated. At the same time, traditional Medicare should be defragmented by unifying its alphabet soup of A, B, C, and D components. Eventually, people of all ages who buy into the public option should receive exactly the same coverage and benefits. Medicare Advantage in some form should also be available to people of all ages. To ease the transition, people who are already in traditional Medicare could be grandfathered into the old program if they preferred it.Second, income-based premium subsidies and cost sharing reductions should be based on a simple, income-based schedule that applies to everyone. The schedule should be set in a way that provides coverage at no cost to people below a specified low-income threshold and is capped at a specified percentage of income for everyone else. The schedule outlined in the Healthy America Program would be a good candidate for consideration.Third, Medicaid, too, should be fully integrated into the system. Despite the rhetoric about states as ‚Äúlaboratories for innovation,‚Äù the fact is the degree to which Medicaid is decentralized at present has many harmful unintended consequences. The scheme proposed by the Biden plan, which seems to reward non-expansion states with a better deal than it offers to expansion states, is clearly unworkable. It would make much more sense to offer the public option, with automatic enrollment, to the low-income populations of all states. If necessary, some kind of maintenance-of-effort payments could be devised to avoid unintended fiscal windfalls to states as their low-income populations move from Medicaid to the public option.Fourth, more proactive measures should be considered to facilitate the phaseout of employer-sponsored insurance. Allowing individual employees to opt out and still claim premium subsidies on the exchanges is only a first step. Ending the employer mandate, which requires many firms to offer health insurance, would be another. Capping or eliminating the deductibility of ESHI benefits would be still another ‚Äî and especially helpful to low-income workers and those who would prefer self-employment if affordable health insurance were available.Fifth, the Biden plan could benefit from a more complete set of tools to encourage transparency and competition in health care markets. The outline does include some measures related to pharmaceutical prices, but more could be done ‚Äî reforms of patent laws; rules for price transparency; changes to medical education; a larger role for physician assistants and nurse practitioners; lower barriers to entry for hospitals, cash-only clinics, and health sharing organizations; and expanding the scope of telemedicine are just a few of many ideas promoted by market-oriented reformers.Perhaps some of these ideas are already incorporated in a more detailed version of the Biden plan that has not yet been published. Properly cleaned up, the Biden plan could join similar proposals like the Healthy America Program and the Medicare for America plan from Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) as alternative ways of moving universal catastrophic coverage closer to practical implementation.Based on a version previously posted at NiskanenCenter.com.

Escaping Flatland: Making VR in VR,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/escaping-flatland-making-vr-in-vr-3da3da2b001a,tywen kelly,48,6,1275,"Virtual Reality (VR) experiences that are made in VR are becoming more abundant, more robust, and more popular. Yet, still, there is no easy way to talk about these experiences. I could say ‚Äúthis experience was made in a VR headset‚Äù, but that‚Äôs a mouthful. I could get fancy and call it a ‚ÄúVR-native experience‚Äù. Or perhaps even fancier, I could call it a ‚ÄúVR experience produced in situ‚Äù. None of these are ideal.I propose a new term: Ingenic. Ingenic is an adjective that describes content that is consumed in the same medium it was produced in. Ingenic is an entirely made up word inspired as a portmanteau of interior + genesis. It is meant to invoke the meaning of creation from within a medium. The way to describe a VR experience made in VR, then, would be to simply call it an ‚Äúingenic experience‚Äù.Google Tilt Brush, Oculus Medium, Unity‚Äôs Editor XR, Unreal VR Editor, and Pixvana‚Äôs Creator tools are a few examples of ingenic tools today. They allow you to create 3D paintings, sculptures, games, and interactive videos without ever having to take off the headset. A creator uses their entire body to gesture the virtual creation into existence.Ingenic tools rise above desktop tools in their intuitiveness. One of the top comments from users of Pixvana‚Äôs ingenic editor is how easy and natural it feels to pick up the controllers and start placing graphics and hyperports in space. To be fair, right now the interfaces in ingenic VR tools are heavily text based. This is a remnant of flatland design (webpages, books) where text still reigns supreme. But the trajectory of ingenic interface design will lean less on text and more on gesture, voice, and context-aware volumetric objects, which would provide an even more intuitive creation process.There are many benefits to ingenic creation. For one, a piece of ingenic content is less likely to have mistakes that break the viewer‚Äôs immersion in the medium. A great example of this is viewing 360 video in a VR headset. Leveling the horizon is very important to creating a sense of immersion. In VR people are very sensitive to even a half-degree pitch in the ground. If our eyes tell us one thing and our inner ear says another, then all of a sudden we are nauseous. It‚Äôs easy to spot an off-kilter horizon in the ingenic environment and much more difficult to spot it in the exgenic environment. It‚Äôs only when we‚Äôre in the headset do we feel the off angle horizon and is our suspension of disbelief cut.I mentioned exgenic just now. It means exactly what is sounds like. Exgenic describes content that is consumed in a different medium from which it was produced in. When you create VR outside of VR then you are operating at a dimensional deficit. You have to translate two-dimensional gestures on the mouse and keyboard into three-dimensional object displayed on a two-dimensional screen. It‚Äôs a mess. This dimensional deficit is a necessary effect of exgenic creation. During the import/export of content across media boundaries, this dimensional deficit can cause some information to be lost in translation. (Plus the dimensional deficit manifests itself in bodily fatigue: Repetitive Strain Injury and Carpal tunnel are not uncommon among 3D modelers using 2D interfaces.)When we consume an exgenic piece of content we sometimes become aware of the fact that it is is exgenic. There is a gap between what the content apparently intended to say, and how I am experiencing it right now. For instance, when you watch 360 video in-headset that causes such bodily discomfort that you know, in the back of your mind, that there was no way the creator of this video even previewed the video in VR before delivering it ‚Äî that is the gap I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs the subtle chasm between expectation and realization. This exgenic gap appears when we perceive stitch lines, left/right eye vertical misalignment in stereoscopic video, or misprojected 2D graphics. Something just feels off and it takes us out.More common is the experience of watching a widescreen film on an airplane in-flight entertainment monitor. Because the airline‚Äôs personal TV monitors have a narrowed aspect ratio, to play a widescreen 70mm film they have to crop a quarter of the frame off the left and right side of the film. The intent of the 70mm film was to be projected on the big silver screen. Not confined to the trenches of in-flight entertainment. This disjuncture can be felt intensely in wide landscape shots which intend to awe the audience, but on an airplane screen the emotional impact falls flat. (Imagine watching Baraka on the plane! It‚Äôs not the same. Not even specific edits for airplanes can completely circumnavigate this.) To prepare the viewer for this shortcoming airplane movies have a watermarked confession, ‚ÄúThis film has been modified from its original version. It has formatted to fit your screen.‚ÄùThe perception of this re-format is what I call an exgenic gap. It‚Äôs the errant neutrino thrown out in a game of telephone between mediums: when Video whispers into VR‚Äôs ear, words are misspoken, misheard, mistranslated. The exgenic gap is the misalignment between a piece of content‚Äôs apparent intention and how it actually plays out in a medium.An exgenic gap is akin to the Uncanny Valley, in that we aren‚Äôt conscious of it once we‚Äôve surpassed the threshold. When people say they don‚Äôt like CGI, what they are really saying is that they don‚Äôt like bad CGI. Similarly, when we experience ingenic content the medium recedes to the background of our perception. VR is good, but there was a lot of poorly executed exgenic VR experiences that have poisoned the well. This can mean seeing VR in a low fidelity, early prototype headset, could dissuade the person from trying VR again.Poor exgenic design means disregarding how people may actually experience the video at the end of the day. Call the exgenic gap the Norman Door of cross-medium design.99% of content today is exgenic. Most media today spans multiple mediums. Entertainment companies today spread their stories across movies, books, toys, and theme parks. Fans of these stories write fan-fiction novels, film YouTube analysis, or dress up in cosplay. Coming from both the individual and corporate end of the spectrum everyone is remixing content across mediums. There is certainly a lot of beauty in intentional exgenic creation ‚Äî some artists use the glitchy flows of data across mediums to say something about world, or to just make a over-processed dank meme. In this tween age of remix it is important to do exgenic design right while ingenic design is still budding.During the shift from toward spatial media (AR, VR, MR) there is going to be a tendency to either reinvent the wheel or entirely disregard previous learnings of flatland information visualization. I think the best way to think about this is to imagine spatial media as another organism added to an ecology of existing organisms. Here each organism represents a medium. As Marshall McLuhan noted, mediums never truly die off, they become the content of the challenger medium. In the landscape of mediums, flatland creatures have become the prey, and the spatial tools have become the predators. Both prey and predator must coexist and coevolved, adapt to one another, knowing full well the power has irreversibly shifted toward spatial media.Nothing will ever be purely ingenic. Nonetheless, the idea of ingenic stands in as an important compass for design. It represents an ideal framework to produce and consume content intentionally, thoughtfully, and intuitively. Eventually it will be a compliment to comment on an exgenic piece and say it feels ingenic.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,7,875,558,4,0,0,6,64
Running a Remote Work Stand-up ‚Äî Rule #2: Upgrade YTB to DCI,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/running-a-remote-work-stand-up-rule-2-upgrade-ytb-to-dci-e45787669c15,James Koran,31,5,1016,"In the first post in this series, I talk about how remote team stand-ups are fundamentally different than their face-to-face equivalents. I follow these five rules to help me run a great remote stand-up for my team:Today‚Äôs post is about Rule #2: Forget ‚ÄúYesterday, Today, Blockers‚Äù and embrace ‚ÄúDecisions, Choices, Impediments.‚ÄùMany face-to-face stand-ups follow a simple script to ensure that everyone on the team shares their status quickly and efficiently by answering three questions:This structure makes a ton of sense for these physical meetings because the primary goal is a shared understanding of ‚ÄúWHAT‚Äù everyone is working on. I‚Äôve proposed an alternative structure for remote meetings that help uncover the ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù and ‚ÄúSO WHAT‚Äù baked into everyone‚Äôs workload. They are the three questions I‚Äôd recommend for a daily remote stand-up:What critical DECISIONS did I make yesterday?I believe best practice for a remote-team is to leverage a shared tool for tracking work accomplished, and work-in-progress. Regardless of the specific tool (you could be using Trello, Jira, or Evernote) everyone on the team should have constant visibility into what you‚Äôre getting done on a daily basis. Recapping this verbally for the team, ‚ÄúYesterday, I wrote the first draft of the new article on Financial Advisors,‚Äù adds little or no new information.Instead, give folks insight into the most important decisions you made with an eye towards how it might impact everyone else on the team. Think something like ‚ÄúI wrapped up my draft of that article on Financial Advisors. I decided to use a house of cards metaphor in my concluding paragraph so Sally might want to start looking for A-spot imagery to match. It‚Äôs also twice as long as we agreed and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs get editorial involved early.‚ÄùWithout this additional information both the art team and the editorial team might not realize that they‚Äôve got additional work until it‚Äôs too late. The larger or more complex the team the more important this context sharing is critical.When you‚Äôve got knowledge workers on a remote team calling special attention to critical decisions highlights the need for collaboration earlier and leads to better outcomes.What CHOICES are ahead of me today?Again, since everyone should already know what you‚Äôre working on today you‚Äôre looking to share more information than just WHAT. Help your team understand the toughest decisions you‚Äôll have to make in your work for the day so that they can better support you. Instead of ‚ÄúToday, I‚Äôm designing the user log-in page‚Äù share something like ‚ÄúToday, I‚Äôm designing the user log-in page. I need to determine if two-factor authentication makes sense, and create a reusable design pattern for text input fields.‚ÄùIf your team-mates are actually listening (this is the point of these meetings right?) then they can immediately provide context or helping information to save you time and energy. John from development might share ‚ÄúTwo-factor authentication is going to break our engineering budget, so unless you believe it‚Äôs a hard requirement then let‚Äôs leave it till phase 2.‚Äù Sally another designer could share ‚ÄúWe just designed a killer log-in page on my other project and it‚Äôs already ADA compliant! Send me a note on slack and I‚Äôll send you the design files. Maybe it saves you some time.‚ÄùDo I have any IMPEDIMENTS?Your team‚Äôs ability to provide immediate feedback or supporting information helps ensure that your solo-working time is as efficient as possible. Your uncertainty about two-factor authentication is completely missing from a simple update like ‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm designing log-in‚Äù but sharing that you‚Äôre making a critical decision provides your team-mates visibility needed to do their jobs better. Focus on upcoming choices, not upcoming actions.If you‚Äôve been in these types of meetings for a while you‚Äôd be shocked how often you hear each person‚Äôs update finish with ‚Äúno blockers.‚Äù I believe that ‚Äúblocked or not‚Äù is way too binary of a question, and doesn‚Äôt help a leader identify ways to make their team most effective. I believe that we‚Äôre all pretty good about sharing when we‚Äôre 100% blocked on a particular task, but we don‚Äôt do a great job calling out when we‚Äôre being less than effective because of inter-team dependencies.I ask teams to share anything that‚Äôs causing them to be less than optimally effective. A developer working on a data ingest function might claim they have ‚Äúno blockers‚Äù but a closer investigation might reveal that they still don‚Äôt have access to the data services they ingesting data from. Instead of no-blockers I‚Äôd rather they share ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on data ingest, and I still don‚Äôt have access to the data service we‚Äôre pulling from. I can keep moving forward against the sample data but if there‚Äôs any difference between that and the live data I‚Äôll have some re-work.‚ÄùThis additional context allows managers to ask follow-up questions to understand the impact of the slow-down and prioritize getting it resolved. I can decide to make a call to get this developer the access he needs, I can ask about maybe switching to a different task with fewer unknowns, or I can decide to accept the risk for the time being. The important thing here is that the team works together to remain not only ‚Äúunblocked‚Äù but also as efficient as possible throughout the duration of the work.As an added bonus, no one enjoys being less productive or efficient than they otherwise could be. Keeping your team moving quickly is a great boost to morale and job satisfaction.In summary, I believe that the old-standby of Yesterday, Today, Blockers should evolve to Decisions, Choices, Impediments for any remote project. This structure adds more fidelity to the information shared daily and empowers your team to collaboratively solve problems before they become a crisis. Use your precious live collaboration time to get everyone on the same page!Check back here soon to learn about my 3rd Rule: Call Multiple Plays.Scatterbrain is a boutique consultancy helping companies unlock the full potential of remote teams.

Exaggerated Health Claims Prompt FDA to Hold First Hearing on CBD,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/exaggerated-health-claims-prompt-fda-to-hold-first-hearing-on-cbd-c49a0207ebe8,Darshan,12,3,622,"Recently, the FDA held a highly anticipated hearing on the regulations surrounding CBD products such as capsules and oils. The hearing was well attended by companies and individuals with invested interest in pushing their agenda forward, including individuals talking about the potential suicidal effects of cannabis, entrepreneurs looking for answers regarding the safety of CBD in products such as cosmetics, and lawyers suggesting potential regulatory frameworks to help guide CBD‚Äôs entrance into the market. Because the current regulations surrounding CBD products are so discordant and ill-defined, the current moment remains a fertile time for companies and individuals to gain a foothold in influencing the regulatory laws of CBD.The most recent FDA hearing on the regulatory guidelines of CBD was provoked by findings suggesting the potential toxicity of CBD products. In an effort to address these health concerns, the FDA held a hearing to gather more data on CBD including its safety, marketing and regulatory issues. During the hearing, they asked speakers to submit well-documented clinical studies to back their claims-focusing more on obtaining data than opinions. The FDA‚Äôs decision to hold a hearing on CBD was a step forward on the path to clarifying what types of regulations companies and individuals might come to expect moving forward.One of the primary areas of confusion surrounding the regulation of cannabis comes from the fact that cannabis is primarily comprised of two basic substances, CBD and THC, which are separately regulated in very different ways. For instance, THC, unlike CBD, is heavily regulated by the DEA and is not acceptable at the federal level, whereas CBD enjoys a less heavy-handed regulation and can be considered federally legal depending on its presence of THC and proposed use. The myriad of laws surrounding these two cannabis substances makes the proper, legal promotion of CBD a difficult undertaking for companies which run the risk of inappropriately marketing their products. If a company or individual is found to be violating this complicated network of federal laws, for example, in the case of inappropriate promotions, they face serious consequences including major fines and criminal punishment. It is crucial for companies to therefore carefully consider how they market their cannabis products to ensure that they remain within FDA-approved boundaries, especially considering how quickly the regulations are changing in the cannabis industry.Although cannabis has become legalized in many different states both for medical and recreational use, companies and individuals still run the risk of incurring fines or penalties when it comes to the actual use of the product itself. For instance, many medical shops contain recreational cannabis products that are marketed by using medical claims, which is a dangerous move for companies to make because it means that they may end up violating federal and state laws and regulations. Many states also require that medical cannabis be marketed according to federal laws relating to the promotion, manufacturing, or sale of such products. This jumble of federal and state laws surrounding the promotion of cannabis products has made it exceptionally difficult for companies to successfully navigate the regulatory space and ensure that they do not face penalties or fines.It remains a difficult task for companies selling cannabis products, including CBD, to remain compliant with state and federal laws and regulations because of the FDA‚Äôs lack of overall clarity. As a consequence of the discordant laws governing the marketing and sale of cannabis products, many companies and individuals are already facing harsh punishments including numerous fines and jail time. This means that companies in the cannabis industry must remain very well-informed on the constantly shifting regulatory framework surrounding the sale of cannabis-derived products-particularly now that the FDA is taking steps toward clarifying its stance on these drugs.Originally published at https://www.darshankulkarni.com on July 25, 2019.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,3,1050,656,1,0,0,3,39
Look at the World Through Someone Else‚Äôs Eyes,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/look-at-the-world-through-someone-elses-eyes-fd1fdd6a4468,Michael Thompson,131,3,457,"And the world will be a better place.Look at the world through someone else‚Äôs eyes and the world will be a better place.I heard this saying many years ago and I recently heard it again.This saying has helped guide me through life; more so in my older age than when I was younger. I was raised in a Christian, military family and taught to do unto others as I would have them do unto me. My life has always been about helping others when I able and trying my hardest to make people laugh. This is because I‚Äôm just naturally goofy and making others laugh helps me to cope with my own depression.As a young man, I would help others without giving it a second thought. If I saw an elderly person trying to unload a shopping cart full of heavy stuff into their car, I would walk over and offer to help. Or maybe a short person was trying to reach something on a top shelf, I would grab it for them and tell them to have a nice day while walking away. However, I never really thought about what that action meant to the other person. I just knew I did something nice for someone else. No big deal, right?However, as a 44-year-old man, I have learned to think a little deeper about my actions. I wonder if other people do the same thing. Do people really mean it when they say, ‚ÄúHave a nice day?‚Äù Or has it become such a common thing to say that it carries no personal weight with it?Look at the world through someone else‚Äôs eyes and the world will be a better place.How many of us as a customer ask the clerk or waitress how their day is going first before they ask us? I try to see things through their eyes when I interact with them. That‚Äôs why I try to say hi first. I ask them how their day is going, and I do so with a smile. This is mainly for one reason. I might be the only person they have a positive interaction with during that entire day. If they have depression as I do, sometimes it only takes one nice conversation to bring them out of their fog.I hope that my interactions with people might be able to keep someone from hurting themselves. Maybe it will put them in a good mood. Maybe it will make them smile. Hopefully, they will pass that experience on and help someone else out as well.Look at the world through someone else‚Äôs eyes and the world will be a better place. I like to think that by following this axiom, I can also become a better person myself.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,1050,695,2,0,0,2,19

You sell your skills to huge corporations with big budgets.And I will say that if you‚Äôre really good at what you do, you could not only be a skilled individual but also a famous individual. These are the one-percenters of the online world and they‚Äôre rolling in the money because they can leverage multiple streams of income.So what‚Äôs the fastest path to success?The Two Top Fields You Need to Be In to Make Money OnlineThe first field you need to be in if you want to make money is marketing. I don‚Äôt need to tell you why marketing is always in high demand.Now when I say marketing I don‚Äôt necessarily mean that you have to hold the job title of ‚ÄòMarketer‚Äô. You may be in the marketing business already.It‚Äôs an extremely broad field and a lot of different professionals are involved in it.For example, if you specialize in creating graphics for businesses you‚Äôre in the marketing business. If like me, you write web content for businesses, you‚Äôre also in the marketing business.Whether directly or indirectly, being in the marketing business is where the money is. Most businesses are spending the majority of their budgets on staying visible to their target audience.So when you provide a web development service, SEO content, or graphic design you‚Äôre indirectly helping businesses with their marketing. Like it or not, you‚Äôre in the marketing business.The second big field you might want to consider getting into is education. The Internet has shown us one thing if nothing else: education doesn‚Äôt have to be formal.When you read an article on this site and you‚Äôre getting value from it, you‚Äôre getting an education.Each time you read a guide, you‚Äôre educating yourself.Education is another field that is always going to be relevant. Everyone wants to learn and wants to get better. There are thousands of educational niches you can tap into. You don‚Äôt need to be standing in a classroom.Online courses are a huge business because there‚Äôs always going to be a strong demand for them.I‚Äôve chosen these two fields because, from where I stand, they‚Äôre not as difficult to get into as say the entertainment business. They also have a permanent demand that‚Äôs not going anywhere as technology improves and trends change.Getting into the Marketing BusinessCrossing the threshold into marketing isn‚Äôt difficult. You just need a skill that businesses want so they can bring in more customers and improve the way they deal with customers.That might be improving their web content because you‚Äôre a writer. Maybe you want to improve the banner on their homepage? Or perhaps you‚Äôre designing Facebook ads?You may even be someone who can rebuild and revamp their whole website through a new theme and a new layout.All these things are valuable to businesses from a marketing standpoint.Here are my top tips for getting into this field:¬∑ Be a master, not a jack of all trades. Specialize and become known for something.¬∑ Expect it to take time. You need experience and you need projects you can point to when you reach out for work.¬∑ Build your own platform. You must brand yourself and the service you‚Äôre offering so people come to you with work.Of course, there are a million more things I can write about it. There have been thousands of books written on it, but these are the general principles you need to understand as you get started.Getting into the Education BusinessOnline education has a lot of competition. It‚Äôs about the way you brand yourself. People aren‚Äôt pulled in by the knowledge you‚Äôre offering but the person who‚Äôs offering it.Why should someone trust you as an expert?You need to brand yourself as an exceptional authority in whatever you‚Äôre teaching. Part of that is results but part of that is also how long you‚Äôve been in the business.I feel pretty confident that I could teach people how to work online. I‚Äôve done it and I‚Äôve been here almost ten years now. I‚Äôm also pretty confident that I could teach people about travelling the world because I‚Äôve done it for close to five years without stopping. I‚Äôve made it work, so I have results.If you don‚Äôt have results and you haven‚Äôt been doing it for a reasonable length of time, don‚Äôt bother. That‚Äôs instantly going to turn people off.But if you do have both of those things you need to start upping your personal brand.There are a bunch of ways in which you can do this. You can offer a free podcast, publish free, valuable content, and invest a lot of time in your social media feeds.It‚Äôs all about getting your name out there because the teacher is more important than the knowledge, when it comes to encouraging people to learn with you.For example, if I wanted to learn about SEO I would look at a teacher like Neil Patel. I don‚Äôt know anything specific about what he might teach in his courses, but I know that Neil is one of the most prominent names in all of SEO.If someone random said, ‚ÄúI will teach you how to be number one on Google.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt pay any attention because I don‚Äôt know who this guy is.If it‚Äôs free I might take a look, but I‚Äôm not going to give him any money for it. How do I know he‚Äôs successful and isn‚Äôt just some con artist?You Always Start an Online Business with a Clean SlateFor experts who have transitioned into the online workplace for the first time, it comes as a surprise.If they‚Äôre not famous and they‚Äôre starting from nothing, they need to leave their egos at the door. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre an animator who worked at Disney for 10 years if nobody knows your name.Anyone can write that they have ten years of experience anywhere. I could write that now and nobody would know the difference.The average small business isn‚Äôt going to call up Disney to confirm anything. It‚Äôs well-known that most businesses don‚Äôt call up previous employers. They have better things to do.So you have to start with a clean slate. You need to get back to that ‚Äòintern mindset‚Äô because nobody‚Äôs going to throw decent money at you unless you can prove your experience.This is another reason why I joined this platform. Nearly all of my work is ghostwritten, so I actually have little to no personal branding despite being active in writing circles for close to ten years.Who‚Äôs going to believe I wrote this or that? My name isn‚Äôt on it and, for all they know, I could be lying. Plus, it‚Äôs too much effort for them to reach out and ask. It could take them days or weeks to get a response.Instead, they can just choose the guy who has lots of content with his name on it.My point is that to build an online business of any kind and win clients you need name value. You need to be able to show off your best work under your name.Unless you can prove it beyond doubt, nobody cares about what you have claimed to have done.Be in this for the Long HaulI say this every time I talk about starting a business online. You could have worked for IBM for 20 years and you‚Äôre still not going to create a great business overnight.It took me at least a year before I was pulling in a comfortable amount.If you‚Äôre not in this for the long haul, you need to go out and get a job as a salaried employee because, otherwise, you‚Äôre just going to get frustrated.What‚Äôs your best piece of advice for being successful in online business?",25/07/2019,0,0,6,1,1050,630,3,0,0,6,227
"Autonomy by land, air & sea",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/autonomy-by-land-air-sea-8fe2a6e4eb5a,Barry Goldsmith,5,10,2488,"The popular narrative around mobility seems to center almost exclusively around autonomous vehicles , which is neither fair nor accurate considering some of the many strides taken in autonomy across the mobility spectrum. In this post I‚Äôll take a look at the future of mobility across land, air, and sea.The most-discussed topic in mobility is the race to develop an autonomous vehicle (i.e., self-driving cars). Billions of dollars have been invested in self-driving technologies by established automakers (GM, Ford, Volkswagen, Mercedes, etc.), technology startups (Argo AI, Waymo, Cruise, drive.ai, Aptiv, Zoox, etc.), and even ride-sharing companies (Uber and Lyft)‚Äî just recently Volkswagen announced a $2.6bn investment in Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle startup also backed by Ford ($1bn investment just 2 years ago). Perhaps surprising given the enormous amount invested in this technology is that we remain several years away from achieving ‚Äúfull‚Äù autonomy ‚Äî the more optimistic reports believe the first true self-driving cars will be available in the early 2020s, despite the lofty goals previously promoted by some firms). As of this writing, Level 2 autonomous features are available in consumer vehicles today while localized Level 3 and Level 4 tests are being conducted across the globe. For those unfamiliar with the stage terminology for autonomous vehicles:Level 1: driver assistance (under some specific conditions, the car controls either the speed or the steering but not both at the same time)Level 2: partial automation (in certain circumstances, the car can steer, accelerate, and brake)Level 3: conditional automation (in ‚Äúperfect‚Äù conditions, the car can monitor the environment and manage driving, although driver intervention will still be required for any ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù circumstances)Level 4: high automation (in select conditions, the car can operate without any human input or intervention)Level 5: full automationMore than just the convenience and safety aspects of removing human input from the driving experience, self-driving cars are expected to change the DNA of the auto industry as we know it and 4 different verticals will arise from the ashes:Mobility-on-Demand: robotaxis operating in urban and suburban environmentsTraditional Ownership: current ownership model but with self-driving vehiclesAutonomous Vehicle Subscription: driverless cars offered via subscription serviceMobility-on-Demand / Autonomous Vehicle Subscription Integrated Network: combination of robotaxis and vehicle subscriptions to create a fully integrated solutionLet‚Äôs lay out the roadmap for these 4 verticals:2019+: The first vertical expected to begin commercialization will likely be robotaxis, or fleets of driverless vehicles operating under traditional ride-sharing business models within a localized area. Many players are racing to be first to market with their own robotaxi fleet, including the traditional ride-sharing players like Uber and Lyft as well as Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Ford, and Aptiv. Critical to this vertical will be the network effect gained by the first player able to introduce a scalable, safe, reliable, convenient, and low-cost fleet.2020 ‚Äî 2021+: Level 4 autonomy features will be rolled out for sale in consumer cars. Full highway autonomy is likely to be the first major release due to the lower complexity of highway driving when compared to suburban or even urban centers, but frankly this phase of roll-out is far less exciting without any network effect or any dramatic change to the current status quo for car ownership.2023+: Now we get to the good stuff ‚Äî an entirely new model of car ownership. In 2019, instant vehicle access with no disruptions necessitates a 1-car-per-owner ownership model; but with the Level 4 automation, that same access can be achieved in harmony with shared mobility. What does that mean in plain English? A subscription service model for shared Level 4 autonomous vehicles. A very common misconception is that Level 5 automation is a pre-requisite for self-driving cars to be offered for sale; in fact, there are several Level 4 use cases that could make ownership attractive (imagine: late at night, few cars on the road ‚Äîgood conditions for Level 4 functionality). A subscription model would reduce cost to allow for faster and greater adoption, which in turn would allow for more efficient route-mapping, taking us to‚Ä¶2030+: As we come closer and closer to Level 5 automation, the split between the robotaxi and the subscription ownership models will blur to create something similar to a fully-integrated network in which autonomous vehicle owners are able to rent their cars to ridesharing services, allowing those services to adopt more asset-light business models as well as access for those not fortunate enough to own their own autonomous vehicles.Cars are not the only form of ground transportation being disrupted by self-driving technology ‚Äî autonomous trucks are coming and present a true shift in the deeply woven fabric of the trucking industry. A quick look at the deeply traditional trucking industry reveals the extend of such a threat. Estimates show the industry is already suffering from a driver shortage (currently 63,000 and rising to 174,000 by 2026), and drivers are on average 7 years older than the typical American worker. To put it simply, younger generations are choosing other careers over the demanding trucking lifestyle. Already some companies have made fully autonomous deliveries with rigs on medium- and heavy-duty trucks costing anywhere from $30,000 ‚Äî $100,000 (mainly using lidar technology). Like cars, however, full autonomy remains a long way off.The roadmap for autonomous trucks is likely 4 parts:2019+: Drivers are required in each truck but use ‚Äúplatooning‚Äù ‚Äî a technique to wirelessly connect a convoy of trucks to a lead truck to allow for heightened safety and fuel efficiencies ‚Äî on the highways (think of this as Level 3 automation).2022+: On interstate highways, truck platoons will feature a driver in the lead truck with all other unmanned trucks following close behind. Upon leaving the highways, however, drivers will be required in each truck.2025+: True Level 4 automation is rolled out, with unmanned trucks operating across the interstate system and other specified areas via platoons and under specific conditions (weather, visibility, infrastructure requirements, etc.). Again, however, drivers are required to meet trucks at interstate exits to drive the final leg to the ultimate destination.2027+: Level 5 automation allows unmanned trucks to complete the entire trip from origin to destination, including local roads.The full impact of autonomous trucks extends far beyond the simple cost efficiencies (fuel, labor, etc.) achieved ‚Äî throughout logistics the effects will be felt. Railroad operators take note: autonomous trucks present a challenge to your business if you‚Äôre unable to compete with the reduced costs of trucking. There is, however, an opportunity for rail carriers to integrate with autonomous trucks to make up for their fixed footprints by extending into short-distance transportation (known as ‚Äúdrayage‚Äù within the industry). Warehouses, distribution and fulfillment centers will need to invest in infrastructure changes to keep up with autonomous trucks as picking and shipping become possible around the clock (rather than just being limited to during the day) and as inventory turns more quickly. Additionally, warehouses will likely need to be outfitted with truck entrances compatible with these autonomous trucks, with some warehouses potentially even being relocated to more remote areas. Ports will require similar changes, especially as they relate to ensuring smooth trucking traffic flows.Just as the future of ground transportation will be shaped by autonomous technologies, so too shall the fate of our skies. Autonomous drones are not a new concept; in fact, the technology is nearly ready to be rolled out in scale. In June Amazon unveiled Prime Air for package delivery, powered by self-driving fleets of drones ‚Äî these are not the drones first developed for the military, but new lightweight drones designed specifically for short mileage autonomous travel. With e-commerce delivery drones have only begun to scratch the surface of their commercial potential: Goldman Sachs estimates that TAM for drones in Construction, Agriculture, and Insurance Claims to be $11.1bn, $5.9bn, and $1.4bn respectively ‚Äî not to mention other use cases including offshore oil & gas refining, emergency services, real estate, utilities, etc. With autonomous drone technology nearing the endzone, the largest remaining hurdle is the lack of rules and systems to govern its use. While both NASA and the FAA are leading efforts to develop airspace management systems, regulatory uncertainty continues to delay the safety, efficiency, and cost benefits that commercial autonomous drone technologies would likely bring.The future of autonomy in our skies, however, lies beyond mere drones ‚Äî autonomy for small (and later large) aircraft will have a profound impact on society as we rethink our traditional modes of transportation. Autonomous aviation is the next generation of transportation system; whether it be skipping traffic in crowded urban and suburban environments or long-distance travel, autonomous aviation will greatly enhance human mobility. Xwing is just one startup building autonomy technology for existing and future aircraft and it divides autonomy into 3 pillars: sense, reason, and control. The first pillar (sense) involves the integration of sensor technologies to allow the aircraft to perceive its surroundings to detect hazards and determine the vehicle‚Äôs position. Sense is the building block on which the second pillar (reason) is built ‚Äî autonomous flight management systems allow the aircraft to translate information perceived into action. Integrated with air traffic control, these flight management systems will allow for seamless navigation of airspace as well as continuous monitoring of system health to ensure safety. With each of the first two pillars in place, the third pillar (control) can be achieved. Autopilot and fly-by-wire systems consisting of flight control computers, redundant actuators, and digital input mechanisms allow fully-autonomous aircraft to not only execute all manner of flight maneuvers but also respond to system failures, thus closing the loop with the flight management system.Innovation in small aircraft has been slow owed to low sales volumes compared to cars as well as constraints to piloting such a vehicle (namely skill and cost). The potential for such technology, however, is vast. From emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (aka eVTOL) aircraft technologies to Jetsons-esque flying taxis, autonomous aircraft will signal a paradigm shift in how we navigate our world. This technology is not far off from making dreams of flying cars a reality: just this year a team of German researchers developed a system that can land a plane without a plane and, perhaps more interestingly, without relying on any ground systems. In the short term such a technology could result in tremendous safety enhancements for commercial travel, but in the longer term the use of visible-light and infrared cameras to guide the plane to the ground signals a major step forward in realizing the second and third pillars of reason and control.While this technology remains experimental, the largest players in aviation (Boeing and Airbus) remain optimistic that autonomous aircraft are the way forward. Boeing‚Äôs autonomous unit Aurora Flight Sciences completed its first test of its electric autonomous passenger vehicle in January as the aircraft took off vertically, hovered above ground for several seconds, and then landed safely. These significant steps forward point towards a not-so-distant future in which flying taxis and even a network of flying taxis are the norm ‚Äî Uber Elevate plans to start test flights by 2020 in Dallas, LA, and Melbourne and Karem Aircraft (one of several Uber eVTOL partners) just completed its $25mm Series A.Equally transformational to the innovations occurring on land and in the sky are the possibilities for autonomy in our oceans. More than 90% of global commerce occurs across our 5 oceans covering more than 140mm sq. miles, only 5% of which has been explored. Unmanned vessels could present enormous opportunity to both government and industry alike to better navigate our waterways.The potential in autonomous vessels lies in three frontiers: capability, safety, and efficiency. From a very fundamental perspective, because machines feel none of pain, hunger, fear, exhaustion, etc. they are sometimes capable of completing missions more effectively than humans. The world‚Äôs 5 oceans pose threats to mission completion ranging from diverse and extreme weather conditions to other environmental hazards to adverse man-made forces (e.g., IEDs). Simply put, autonomous vessels operating in such environments would mean lesser human involvement and thus increased safety.Further benefits are noticeable in the dollar and environmental savings made possible by unmanned vessels. Leidos has written extensively about how current hull shapes are designed for crew comfort rather than for true fuel efficiency and has gone so far as to develop blueprints for a smaller, more agile, more aerodynamic ship capable of operating with fewer (if any) crew and on less fuel. These ships feature a trimaran design and Leidos claims they should be capable of traveling for up to 3 months with minimal human intervention thanks to many of the autonomous technologies discussed above. The company claims the use of an ‚Äúopen systems architecture‚Äù approach creates a design more adaptable and affordable and easier to operate.From a military perspective, the impact of such unmanned vessels is tremendous. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance is one of the military‚Äôs most important, most dangerous, and most expensive missions owed to the environments in which these ships operate. Autonomous vessels towing sensors behind them to detect surface and sub-surface objects (lawn-mowing-esque) could greatly alleviate the burden placed on manned vessels.The cost efficiencies achieved through the use of autonomous ships could be staggering from a commercial perspective. The International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation estimates the cost of a single voyage by a large container ship to be $17.5mm. Autonomous vessels can be designed without many of the comforts required for a crew from sleeping quarters to dining facilities even to plumbing. These lighter vessels would save cost on not just fuel but also crew salaries, food, supplies, and insurance. The cost savings are likely even greater considering these unmanned vessels will be designed for cargo rather than crew. Furthermore, in tandem with predictive and planned maintenance technologies, autonomous vessel capabilities could dramatically reduce operating costs. Imagine the impact to our ports and shipping infrastructures when replacing today‚Äôs ships with more predictable, more manageable, less costly autonomous vessels.Beyond military and commercial use cases, autonomous vehicles are capable of amazing environmental and humanitarian achievements. Autonomous technology has been used by RanMarine Technology to create ‚ÄúWaste Sharks‚Äù ‚Äî autonomous robots collecting garbage as they traverse ocean waters. Autonomous systems are being developed to conduct medical evacuations, deliver critical resources, provide more consistent communications capabilities, and make other extractions that could result in real human life savings.Mobility companies are beginning to recognize the potential of autonomy in our water systems. Toyota AI Ventures recently participated in Sea Machines Robotics‚Äô 10mm Series A. Sea Machines is working on systems to fully automate smaller vessels as well as combine autonomous technology with human actors on larger cargo ships, and there are sure to be more startups with similar missions.Clearly, the future of autonomous technologies is not relegated just to land vehicles as largely seems to be the popular narrative. Opportunities exist across land, air, and sea for companies taking advantage of these paradigm-shifting technologies as well as for investors who see the potential disruption inherent in these businesses.",25/07/2019,0,0,22,0,,,0,0,0,2,20
We All Wobble,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/we-all-wobble-7ee78c8df474,Carrie Jones,464,5,944,"Interesting people and interesting stories don‚Äôt happen without a little worry and some pain. It‚Äôs about living through emotion, through the tear-soaked nights where you‚Äôre sweating over your existence. It‚Äôs about fear of being alone, or unloved, or unliked ‚Äî and risking it anyways, just embracing who you are and your lack of chill and going after your passion.Writing and living are about joy and they are about pain. And the most interesting people are the explorers.This is something I try to remind myself when I‚Äôm freaking out inside. I remind myself to face my fears, to be an explorer, to not run away from the interesting.But I know that the secret to writing good stories is understanding yourself, and your relationship to other people. It‚Äôs about living despite fear and trying to understand people and their own inner worlds, the ones that suck them dry and make them proud, the things that make them sweat instead of sleeping, their dreams, the broken dreams and the ones that they still might fulfill.The other week, I went into a bar in Portland, Maine. It was this dive-bar type place where you could get two beers for $7, which in Portland is super cheap because normally one beer costs about $700 ‚Ä¶ or something.But that‚Äôs not the point of the story.When I went into the bar, I sort of wanted to turn around and leave.True admission time: I‚Äôm not a bar person. Even in college, I only went to a bar twice. Both times were disasters. One involved me hitting on a narc officer, which was the first and only time I‚Äôve ever hit on someone. THAT IS HOW BADLY IT WENT! The other bar visit involved me hiding under a table for‚Ä¶ Well, for a really long time.Secret: It is pretty beer-floor sticky and old gum disgusting under bar tables.So, me wanting to leave a bar is not a new thing. But this Portland bar? This was the bar of short stories in the New Yorker, Hemingway, and Raymond Carver. There were no hipsters. The place had a pool table, scarred from fights and bad hits. The only other decoration was a giant mirrored Miller Lite sign on the wall. It had a really skinny, old man bartending who wobbled a bit while he poured and repositioned his man parts with his hand before he put a straw in the owner‚Äôs glass.When I came in, three guys at the far end of the bar were talking to each other about women and um ‚Ä¶ making babies .‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm not sure how to phrase that delicately. But it wasn‚Äôt about delicately making babies; that‚Äôs for sure.They stopped talking when I came into sight because I am not full of testosterone. Anyways, it was a weird scene. But at the end of my one beer, the bartender was talking and offered a piece of his recent history.On the back of his head was a huge scar, just congealed and thick and rough looking.‚ÄúI fell down Tuesday. I was getting a smoke and I stepped off the curb and wham! Stepped wrong. I had some booze in me, too, but my legs aren‚Äôt so good anymore and I wobble,‚Äù he said.He showed me his scar.‚ÄúIt bled all over the place. My daughter‚Äôs studying to be a lawyer and she‚Äôs so mad at me because I wouldn‚Äôt go to the hospital. The EMT guys when they came? They were like, ‚ÄòYou have to stop smoking so we can work on you,‚Äô and I was like pointing at the blood pouring down my face and I was, ‚ÄòHey, man, I went through a lot to get this cigarette lit. Can I have two drags?‚Äô And they said that I could.‚ÄùHe smiled. He shrugged. He pointed at the massive scar on the back of his head again and laughed at himself.Here‚Äôs a guy who listens to other people‚Äôs stories all day, stuck in the stifling, hot building, prowling behind a bar as the Portland tourists pretty much snub their noses, peeking in and gasping, heading for trendier places. Portland was just named best restaurant city in the U.S. by Bon Appetit or some magazine like that. There are a lot of trendier places.But he told me his story that day. He told me about his medic son. His daughter. The way he can‚Äôt stand so well anymore. The way that sometimes he just longs to step outside the bar and have a cigarette so sometimes he does.‚ÄúBut I wobble,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWe all wobble,‚Äù I offered and he looked at me. He really looked for a second, and then another.‚ÄúYou get it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou get it.‚ÄùI can only hope.There is this beautiful weirdness that happens when you step out of your comfort zone in life and in writing. There is nothing cooler than the delightful quirky connections that happen when you actually talk to people about themselves, the bartenders, the house cleaners, the guy who hoses out a restaurant‚Äôs grease pit, the woman who grooms dogs, the lady at the campground with what seems like eighteen kids and a breast cancer plate on her truck. There is this great connection that happens in the noise and clutter of life when we just take a second to listen.And that‚Äôs what I want when I write and when I live: I want to listen.I‚Äôm over here on the internet and so is more of my writing and my books and podcast, Dogs are Smarter Than People. I‚Äôm also a writing coach.And every day, my animals and I wobble a bit and share inspiring bits on Twitter.Originally published at http://barharborstory.com on July 25, 2019.",25/07/2019,2,0,2,6,1050,1166,3,1,0,5,239
How Your Brain on Joyfulness Unlocks Your Full Potential.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-your-brain-on-joyfulness-unlocks-your-full-potential-f59d33cbfbd2,Michael Burkhardt,749,4,574,"Just work hard and put in more hours, struggle long enough, then you‚Äôll achieve your goals.You made it!You finally got your promotion, your internship, your good grade.Now, it is time to be happy! Or maybe not?This is the old formula and it has been applied many times with many lives spent this way. Luckily humankind is becoming more conscious about health, the value of time, and overall well-being.The new formula is to focus on positive feelings and emotions such as happiness and joyfulness right from the beginning of working towards a goal or vision.But isn‚Äôt happiness and joyfulness the same?No, there are substantial differences.Happiness is external and comes from things that we achieve such as goals, things that we buy, and activities that we do. Happiness can be intense but is short-lived.Joyfulness starts from within. It is extracted when we are living in the moment, experiencing life fuller, being grateful for the little things, nurturing self-realization. Joyfulness is more sustainable.Now in order to achieve a positive brain, the focus should lie on maintaining joyfulness with some sprinkles of happiness.Shawn Achor, author of The Happiness Advantage and TedX Speaker (20 Mio views), says that even the top 10% of the happiest individuals in a company are not necessarily happy all the time.However, they follow something called rational optimism where you start with a realistic assessment of the present while being optimistic about finding a solution. Living in this present state is the start for everyone to be more joyful.If you follow this approach you significantly outperform a brain that is negative, neutral, or stressed in terms of ‚Äúintelligence, energy, how long you can work on a project, how many possibilities you see, how many connections you have, your health, etc .‚ÄùFor example, doctors perform their diagnoses 50% faster with three times more intellectual flexibility when their brain is positive. In addition, intelligence tests taken with a positive state outperform tests taken with a negative brain.Now you might ask, how can I develop a joyful and happy brain?Luckily there are many habits for a more positive brain.Start your day with gratitudeI start every day with a gratitude meditation and write down three things I am grateful for. Then I open the door, suck in the fresh air, look up the sky, and say thanks for a new day full of life, opportunities, and joyful moments. If you look closely, daily things such as the sky, breathing, or a tree are magical by itself.Embark on a path of Self-RealizationNothing is more powerful than realizing who you are and living your life without social conditioning and the opinions of other people. You will know your strengths, weaknesses, and potentials. Your mind is working for you instead of against you now.Exercise dailyExercise stimulates endorphins and clears your head. It can give you some short-term happiness and long-term benefits through a healthy body. Important is that you do not need to go to the gym all the time. Instead, take the stairs, do a sprint to work. Practice yoga in your breaks. Just be active throughout the day, not only in the gym!Read uplifting contentFrom one of the best books I read, stems the following quote,If you are concerned about the world, the first thing you need to do is to transform yourself into a joyful being ‚Äî Sadhguru, taken from the Bestseller Inner Engineering.Find your joyfulness hackMine is a 15 min gratitude meditation and a 10 min HIIT training.",25/07/2019,1,0,14,0,898,888,5,0,0,11,105
What‚Äôs the Truth on What to Eat?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/whats-the-truth-on-what-to-eat-85e16d8d37d6,Janis Cox,2900,5,730,"When I married my hubby, 48 years ago, I didn‚Äôt know anything about cooking. Nothing. Nada.Therefore on Sundays, we went home to Mama for some good cooking.I learned some easy meals ‚Äî a lot with hamburger and even ‚Äúhamburger helper‚Äù (YUCK). I cooked chicken-a-la-king one time with a tin of chicken, not looking at the label which read ‚Äújellied chicken‚Äù. When hubby went to take a bite, the bite continued and continued as it was all stuck together. He bravely worked his way through my attempt and I learned not to use ‚Äújellied chicken‚Äù again.Everything was going well, except when I went to try to put on the icing, the top part of the cake slid to one side. When I presented the cake to hubby, it was like the leaning tower of Pisa.I guess I picked up recipes from my mother and learned a few quick meals which I even use today. One is salmon patties, using an egg, oatmeal, cooked onion and garlic spice. We make into patties and fry in the frying pan. Top with chili sauce.Hamburger (now we use organic) with lots of veggies cooked in a frying pan, then add diced tomatoes. I still love this one.Then there was pizza and Kraft dinner with hot dogs. Neither of which we eat now.When we bought a barbecue, then I only needed to make the vegetables for an easy meal. We used canned vegetables in the early days, then frozen. I am not sure when I finally switched to fresh (although frozen is also very fresh and I use frozen often).Over the years I became more skilful. We ate more fresh fruits and vegetables. We changed to frozen or fresh over canned. We read more. We experimented.We found out that all the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù didn‚Äôt really help our health. Here are a few things that hurt my health.www.medicalnewstoday.comAs a salesman, my husband had many nights out with suppliers and customers. Dining out with good food and desserts and drinking alcohol led to a large weight gain over the years. A very large weight gain. And no matter how he tried to lose weight after retiring, nothing worked. He tried exercise too.After watching FedUp the movie,fedupmovie.commy husband finally said,‚ÄúA calorie is not a calorie. It‚Äôs how the body uses it that makes the difference.‚ÄùWe started to search for how we could help him lose the weight he had been trying to lose all those years and still make food interesting and enjoyable.We found that if we stopped all sugars, reduced packaged goods to a minimum, stayed away from most grains ‚Äî then he could lose. Finally, success. Now we eat as naturally as possible. We look for organic meats and eat lots of vegetables and fruits.He actually not only lost the weight but has kept off over 40 pounds in the past 4 years. He feels younger and has more energy.We found the Paleo diet (vegetables and meats) worked well. Then we tried Keto (allows cheese but takes away high glycemic fruits). Right now it‚Äôs a blend of the two. We mix in a few non-paleo/keto items as well. And we don‚Äôt worry as much when we go out or travel. Basically, we stick to heavy on vegetables. Lots of spices.We found out that fats were not the problem but sugar was. We use olive oil, coconut oil and avocado oil. We eat all types of nuts. We use butter.We eat a variety of these ‚Äî fresh and frozen, everything from all greens, to onions, garlic, squash, cauliflower, celery, carrots, cucumbers, peppers, eggplant, brussel sprouts, parsnips, tomatoes, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, beans, beets, zucchini, and asparagus. We sometimes eat sweet potatoes but never white potatoes (and yes I see white potatoes in the photo).We stay low on the high sugar fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes and oranges. But we eat lots of berries, cantaloupe, avocado, and watermelon.We don‚Äôt eat many grains ‚Äî but occasionally have stoneground oats, rice, and quinoa.Fish ‚Äî all typesChicken TurkeyNuts and seedsEggsLean red meats (beef and pork)Hard cheeses ‚Äî parmesan and other specialitiesNo fruit juicesLots of water (I like with lemon)Coffee TeaHerbal TeasAn occasional glass of wine, or beer (hubby)We both have low blood pressure, good cholesterol, and no problems in our health.How do you eat?

The Balm of Camp,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-balm-of-camp-9aece5b1d978,Bryn McCoy,113,6,1261,"At any given time, at least a hundred notifications line up in my digital queue, promising me a better life beyond the click.

And you don‚Äôt have to listen.‚Äù Being a product designer myself, I skeptically skim through the noise. But more often than I‚Äôd expect, I find myself meandering right into these mousetraps. Then I really surprise myself when I buy. Though I didn‚Äôt see it coming, I‚Äôll bet there‚Äôs a maker on the other end of that message that knew. She knew about the product and every part of its brand experience, then figured out exactly how to nudge people like me straight into action. Sadly I‚Äôm not as unique as I think I am; I‚Äôm just a compilation of the archetypes, the recurring themes in our cultural mythology that designers, writers and many makers know well.Some makers tell stories, some design cars, others fashion clothes. Some of us are designing interfaces to make the machines greet us more gracefully. All of us watch closely to observe how our craftsmanship might elevate our people‚Äôs experience. As humans, some of our defining traits stem from the masterful making of things then sending them off into society by way of storytelling. What do these products and stories do for us, beyond their surface utility? A lot actually. These products and experiences are tools that transport us to our future selves. Cultural products speak to our aspirational tendencies. Deep down, they promise success and happiness, even heroic adventures.My work as a product designer focuses on creativity and its impact on community. I‚Äôm particularly intrigued with products that tap into a cultural story and get carried forward through commerce and media. The ones we hear about have successfully woven a rich fabric of meaningful connections to achieve maximum impact. How does it all come together? And why do we care?Being quite new compared to other creative disciplines, digital design realized its objective power right away‚Äìlots of info, processed very quickly can cover a lot of ground. More recently, we digital product designers have begun to grasp the superpower of emotional connection through the more subjective inner worlds of our consumers. Though qualitative research to understand why people do what they do is a mainstay in successful product design teams, we‚Äôre still often missing a link to identify our consumers‚Äô latent needs and the underlying motives that make them meaningful. More mature design practices know all about this. Looking to fashion and theater, they‚Äôve opened my eyes to another universe of deeply moving cultural communication. Through their stories and products, they‚Äôve long been leveraging these connections to make things that matter. They are modern day mythologists.We got a glimpse of such mythology in action when the Metropolitan Museum of Art launched its latest curated fashion collection the first Monday in May‚ÄìCamp: Notes on Fashion. The Met Gala set forth a look, as championed for the rest of us by the stars who‚Äôve joined the Camp in full regalia. They move in fits and starts along a red carpet, and we see through media‚Äôs lens how themes take shape from the visions of design masters and the beautiful people who embody their message.Whether or not we‚Äôve intentionally adopted style as a tool in our own social presence, we‚Äôre all impacted by the judgment that comes with what we wear. Cindy Sherman, an artist well known for using dress-up to transform herself into characters‚Äìthe women of vintage Hollywood, aging socialites, circus performers, pin-ups and milkmaids‚Äìplays with concepts both campy and creepy to explore society‚Äôs assumptions. We see these tropes and immediately connect with their intriguing resonance. Though Sherman is often the subject of images, she edits out those that capture her essence, opting instead for the look that represents the iconic idea she‚Äôs going for‚Äìonly the symbol is worth sharing. In her recent feature in The Gentlewoman she remarked, ‚ÄúAnd the one thing I‚Äôve always known is that the camera lies.‚ÄùThe Met‚Äôs Costume Institute Curator Andrew Bolton also knows there‚Äôs more than meets the eye. He themed this year‚Äôs event in response to Susan Sontag‚Äôs 1964 essay ‚ÄúNotes on ‚ÄòCamp‚Äô.‚ÄùAmong my favorites of Sontag‚Äôs 58 notes is this one:#10. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. It‚Äôs not a lamp, but a ‚Äúlamp‚Äù; not a woman, but a ‚Äúwoman.‚Äù To perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role. It is the farthest extension, in sensibility, of the metaphor of life as theater.Sontag‚Äôs sentiments on Camp make this year‚Äôs theme particularly compelling for those of us with a love-hate relationship with fashion. She explained, ‚ÄúI am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it.‚ÄùOur relationships with products are similarly complex. From fashion and beauty to our phones and smart homes, these things mean more than function and form. Most of our things have a job to do. There are additionally many nuances in how and why they do what they do. While some keep it basic and utilitarian, others imbue the job with luxurious experience. Our interactions with these things also impact many levels of how and why we do what we do. When we get deep, we realize that our relationships with things contribute to our identity altogether. I learned this from a market research report when working on software for the Moto Z phone. Consumers felt that their phone was an extension of themselves. Digging deeper into this phenomenon, I found Russel Belk‚Äôs research exploring collections, possessions, and the extended self,‚ÄúFrom the small boy to the connoisseur, the joy of standing before one‚Äôs accumulated pile and being able to say ‚Äòthis belongs to me‚Äô is the culmination of that feeling that begins with ownership of the first item‚Ä¶ they become us.‚ÄùStyle is having a cultural moment that‚Äôs become very much about an experience beyond the simple presence of a look. We can get creative with our sense of self and mindfully map where we fall into the social order. The style industry banks on this. We gather what we need to create a presence, hone our stories in social experiments amped up by our digital reach, then watch where they trend. Most of us can‚Äôt stop watching the rising stars in our circles‚Äìthe hood favorites, pros on their rocket ride, the pop culture ascent. Why? Since the Greek Gods, our icons inspire us to connect through stories that resonate with our deepest desires.Those desires are our beacons, they guide us to the life we most want to live. Mythology and literature professor Joseph Campbell famously taught us about this ideal path into our human experience. He wrote, ‚ÄúIf you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living.‚Äù That‚Äôs the magic of mythology, that these beautifully crafted stories, characters and artifacts we can‚Äôt stop thinking about, they are the media that move us along our path. As such, our most iconic brands, media mavens and all the things we buy from them just keep showing up, pointing us in the direction of our wildest dreams.The Costume Institute‚Äôs spring 2019 exhibition CAMP: Notes on Fashion examines how irony, humor and exaggeration are expressed in fashion, at The Met Fifth Avenue May 9 ‚Äî Sept 8.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,1,800,600,1,0,0,0,17
Is The Fourth Industrial Revolution Killing Your Career?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-killing-your-career-ae9301139586,Crystal Jepsen üçï,281,5,713,"I think we can all agree that our world is changing rapidly with the technological advances we have experiences in the last ten years. Technology is changing the landscape of the labor market and is leaving many workers stuck in jobs they are overqualified for. It‚Äôs a struggle to even get these jobs because of negative employer perceptions and high rates of competition amongst applicants. The lucky people who score a position can find themselves stuck there, unable to find a way back into the career they trained for. The demand for your industry could be changing amidst the digital changes of the Industrial Revolution we currently find ourselves in, don‚Äôt let it leave you behind.Employers worry you will become bored with the work, worry you‚Äôll want to climb the ranks too fast, worry you will want a huge salary or worry you‚Äôre too old to adjust to a new job. I get it, I really do. But even educated workers fall on hard times and need a job like everyone else, they have to put food on the table for their littles too. The amount of overqualified workers is increasing around the world, so perceptions need to change to give everyone an equal chance at finding work. The higher rate of people receiving college educations and the increase in immigration rates account for the high rates of overqualified workers in Canada.‚ÄúIf you think it‚Äôs expensive to hire a professional, wait until you hire an amateur.‚Äù ‚Äî Red AdairIn 2014 Canada had one of the highest overqualified rates in the world, sitting at 27%. The U.S. has a rate of 20% of workers being overqualified for their roles. That‚Äôs roughly one-fifth of workers being overqualified for their current work roles in Canada. A significant amount of these overqualified workers are Canadian immigrants who struggle to find a job that matches their skills and education, many feel Canadian employers hold less regard for education and training obtained outside of Canada. An ill-conceived perception that‚Äôs hurting their chances of finding the work they are trained for. Also and illegal bias.I believe there is one more important reason the number of overqualified workers is increasing ‚Äî the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution. We are currently in the sweep of an industrial revolution that will herald our complete absorption with technology. It‚Äôs referred to as Cyber-Physical Systems.‚ÄúThis revolution will see emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.‚Äù ‚Äî Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic ForumThe beginning of all the industrial revolutions have shaken labor markets and left behind workers who failed to keep up with the changes. Some jobs will die out as they are no longer needed and new jobs will emerge to replace them. Massive changes to the agricultural industry happened during our first revolution around 1765 when mechanization altered the way we grow and harvest our food. Before this revolution, half of Canadians worked in agriculture, today only two percent work in the industry.‚ÄúWhenever a groundbreaking technology arrives, a predictable pattern follows. The technology disrupts existing industries, leading to job losses.‚Äù -Stephen S. Poloz ‚Äî GovernorI‚Äôm willing to bet a lot of overqualified workers stuck in jobs far below their skill level are trained for positions that are decreasing in demand. When the number of open positions in your field goes down, the competition to get that job increases. After struggling for a while to find a job you‚Äôre trained for and failing, it makes sense that you would start applying for lower-level jobs. There is a crazy amount of competition for entry-level positions in Canada, look at how many applicants applied to this General Clerk position at Save-On-Foods.Perception bias in employers isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and neither is the industrial revolution. It‚Äôs vital for you to address employer bias before it hurts your chances of getting the job. It‚Äôs just as important for you to learn about careers that are increasing in demand. Perhaps you will only be stuck in a ‚Äúboring‚Äù job temporarily while the ebb and flow of your industry changes, but you could be wasting your time trying to get hired for a job that is dying.Be Proactive.",25/07/2019,0,0,14,2,1050,559,3,1,0,10,5
Keystone Cops: the U.S. Oughtta Level Up Priorities in China Trade Dispute,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/keystone-cops-the-united-states-oughtta-level-up-its-priorities-in-its-trade-dispute-with-china-36b5ae17b0cb,RogerKay,675,5,981,"The international situation remains touchy in the tech industry. U.S. policy with respect to China is lurching all over the place. Unintended consequences are rife. We risk hurting ourselves more than the other guy.The Trump administration‚Äôs application of the blunt instrument of tariffs may damage its intended targets, but it will also disrupt U.S. firms. When it comes to the tech industry, the United States and China are more intertwined than any other two nations on earth. Almost all supply chains involve shipment back and forth between them.The disruption goes both ways, as U.S. firms trying to sell in China are thwarted while Chinese companies attempting to invest in the United States are disqualified. And each story of product lines and services has its own particular twists and turns, but nearly all of them are diminished commercially by political chaos and uncertainty.It is against this background that the race to the next generation of wireless service ‚Äî 5G ‚Äî is playing out. A year ago, Huawei was just another competitor in the wireless equipment market. Yes, it‚Äôs true, the company already had somewhat of a reputation in the industry for playing fast and loose with intellectual property, but it also had an interest in protecting intellectual property rights, since it was steadily building a formidable portfolio of technology patents of its own. All the players ‚Äî American, Chinese, European, and other technology enterprises around the world ‚Äî had agreed to a standard set during meetings of the worldwide standards body 3GPP ‚Äî rivals Qualcomm and Huawei included.But what a difference a year makes. In the United States, a belief has solidified that China‚Äôs potential dominance in 5G is an existential threat. And Huawei is viewed as nothing less than an extension of the Chinese government, bent on stealing U.S. trade secrets and spying on Americans. If one is willing to don a set of glasses that filters out the more paranoid elements of this competitive view, there is still a lot to look at. While Huawei and Qualcomm are matched competitors in some ways, the playing field is deeply tilted in the Chinese company‚Äôs favor in others.A key difference: Qualcomm must thrive in a fully competitive market, whereas the Chinese government has Huawei‚Äôs back. Essentially, Huawei is subsidized by Chinese industrial policy tools and lucrative contracts. Whether or not the Chinese government is using Huawei as a front for spying activity, it certainly has an interest in seeing Huawei be successful. Perhaps the U.S. government should pay more attention to ensuring the prosperity of Qualcomm, its best hope for maintaining leadership in wireless communications.Qualcomm is essentially the R&D arm of the telecommunications industry, a goose that lays thousands of golden eggs. At the moment, Qualcomm also leads in cellular semiconductor devices.Huawei‚Äôs ambition is to rule a vertically integrated cellular ecosystem. It already leads in infrastructure and is pushing to be number one in handsets. At the same time, it has invested in ‚Äî and is increasingly using ‚Äî its own semiconductors.In a scenario where Qualcomm is hampered or even crippled by U.S. government constraints or interference, Huawei will be able to fill the vacuum, eventually dominating the entire industry. To have a foreign company, particularly a Chinese one, become the well to which everyone in the cellular business must trek for their essential technology would lead to a poor national outcome for the United States.In the recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. Qualcomm decision by Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California, the judge imposed draconian penalties against Qualcomm, which, if carried out, could destroy the company‚Äôs licensing business model, particularly its ability to finance R&D for the whole U.S. cellular industry. This decision is such a travesty that a dissenting FTC commissioner felt it necessary to publish an editorial in the Wall Street Journal at the end of May decrying it.The federal government came to Qualcomm‚Äôs rescue once before, when a foreign company (Broadcom) tried to buy it. In the FTC case, Koh‚Äôs judicial activism flies in the face of the stated positions of the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Justice (DoJ), and the Department of Energy (DoE), all of which understand that this is not just a one-off thing.These other agencies are asking, what are you thinking, FTC?The winner of the race to 5G will dominate the industry for at least the next decade, as the technology evolves and new 5G releases come out every 18 months to two years. Thus, an isolated FTC finds itself in a rare dispute with departments in the executive branch that it normally works with quite closely. The DoJ, typically the go-to U.S. government authority on antitrust, disagrees fundamentally with the FTC‚Äôs willingness to use antitrust rules to find liability in this case.When the FTC first brought its case, the agency was joined at the hip to Apple, which, in order to drive a beneficial settlement with Qualcomm, abetted the case and others like it throughout the world. But when Apple settled its lawsuit with Qualcomm in March this year, the FTC‚Äôs case continued to roll on under its own momentum. The commission itself is divided on the subject, with two commissioners each on either side of the partisan line and the new chair having recused himself. This state of affairs doesn‚Äôt allow the FTC to call off its own dogs.For now, the case is out of Koh‚Äôs hands and in those of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The DoJ, DoD, DoE and several other parties recently filed statements of interest (like friend-of-the-court briefs but without the requirement of court approval) with this court.We can only hope that the appeals court does its job, which should be to grant a stay and then reverse the absurd stance of the Northern District. Otherwise, the next decade of innovation in telecommunications could end up under the yoke of Chinese hegemony.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,1018,570,1,0,0,10,41
The Secret to Powerful Slides,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-secret-to-powerful-slides-971b64284572,Russell Rowe,279,4,814,"When it comes to preparing a presentation, creating good slides seems to be what people struggle with the most. The majority of people who regularly deliver presentations aren‚Äôt trained designers so they don‚Äôt think like designers.A good instructional designer understands all the components of a presentation and knows the purpose of slides. They understand when slides should be considered in the preparation process. To create a successful presentation you need to think like a designer.The problem is, many people think the slides are the presentation and that‚Äôs where they start. You‚Äôve been there. You‚Äôre asked to deliver a presentation and you begin the creation process by opening PowerPoint or Keynote and building a deck, forcing your message into the slides.Starting with the slides can alter your message and distract from what the audience really needs to hear. Your slides sole purpose are to add visual support to your presentation.Your presentation should stand on its own and slides are just a great way to enhance the overall experience. Too often, slide decks are more like presentation notes the speaker reads to the audience than a tool to support the message.One indicator of a great slide deck is when someone asks you to send them your deck and you can respond with confidence, ‚ÄúSure, but it won‚Äôt do you any good without me!‚ÄùYou‚Äôre Batman, your slides are Robin!Yes, slides are intriguing. Heck, they can be downright cool with some of the new enhancements to tools like Keynote and PowerPoint. The thing is, slides are not your presentation and without you, they can‚Äôt create an emotional connection and move your audience.In fact, really awesome and compelling slides can distract your audience from your message if you‚Äôre not careful. Don‚Äôt hide behind your slides and expect them to tell your story for you.It‚Äôs far more effective to use slides to enhance your narrative by creating a better visual experience for the listeners than to try and let them tell the whole story. I‚Äôve never seen a slide deck that could compel anyone to take action, that‚Äôs your job.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, slides are an important component of your presentation. Just remember there‚Äôs a lot of work that should go into your presentation before you jump into slide creation mode.Building your slides should be the last thing you think about when developing your presentation. You first have to know your audience, gain a strong understanding of your message, and structure it in a compelling way.Creating your presentation is like constructing a building. Although you may have a style and theme in mind, you need a blueprint, a solid foundation, and a strong structure in place before you can decorate.Your presentation blueprint is your mind map of what you know your audience needs to hear based on your expertise of the subject. This is crucial to building a strong presentation, and being the expert and knowing your audience are your first priorities.From the blueprint, you can build a solid foundation. The foundation of your presentation is your message. Gaining a good understanding of your message and what you want your audience to remember is the most important component of the presentation and vital to a successful outcome.Once you understand your message, you need to structure it in a way that creates an engaging story. How you position your message will be the difference between whether your audience is compelled to take action or not.Now you can decorate!Your slides are the decorations. Developing the foundation and structure from a clear blueprint first will give you the inspiration you need to create slides that support and enhance your message. That‚Äôs the secret to powerful slides; getting the order right!You need to think differently to build meaningful slides that support your presentation. You need to think like a designer. Build your message and structure from a solid blueprint first, and then you can decide what slides you need to support that. Your slides are not the presentation, they‚Äôre only necessary to support the message you want your audience to remember.Don‚Äôt let the slides steal the show. Their purpose is to complete the visual experience for your audience and should be considered only after you‚Äôve carefully developed your message.Of course, you‚Äôll want your slides to be impactful. There are many tips to help make your individual slides compelling and beautiful and that‚Äôs what the follow-up to this article (6 Tips for Mastering Your Slides) is all about. For now, just remember the secret is getting things in the right order and if you do that, you‚Äôll be on your way to great results from your presentations.

Wide or Exclusive: How should you publish your books?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/wide-or-exclusive-how-should-you-publish-your-books-d043528e3e16,TJ Herbranson,569,5,530,"The wide or exclusive debate is raging. Independently published authors across the community are taking sides on an issue that affects the bottom line and the principle of being an ‚Äúindie.‚ÄùAn ‚Äúindie‚Äù author is one who publishes independently of the traditional industry and outside those constructs. Some call this self-publishing, but that definition is also up to debate. Suffice it to say, indie writers are ones who control the entire process of selling their books, whether they hire out parts of it or do it all themselves.Within this community, some indies publish exclusively on Amazon because the Big ‚ÄòZon holds the monopoly on the ebook industry right now. (But the Justice Department just launched an antitrust review, so stay tuned.) Some indies publish wide because they don‚Äôt want to be beholden to one book-selling avenue.The big question is should you or shouldn‚Äôt you? Let‚Äôs start with what the heck we‚Äôre talking about.When we discuss wide or exclusive, publishing wide means you put your books up for sale on a variety of different outlets: Kobo, iBooks, Barnes & Noble, Amazon and anywhere else that sells books. The easiest way to do this is through an aggregator like Smashwords or Draft2Digital. Independent authors like Joanna Penn publish wide and in this podcast, she admits that Amazon represents only 11% of her book income stream. She does this because she wants to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù of the constraints to one vehicle.(Take back your writing time with this free marketing toolkit)It means you are publishing exclusively on Amazon through Kindle Direct Publish (KDP) and taking advantage of the benefits of being an Amazon Select author. Some of those benefits include Kindle Unlimited, where authors are paid for number of pages read by readers in the program, and additional promotions like Kindle Countdown. Authors who are rapid releasing and in genres like Romance, Mystery/Thriller and Fantasy/Sci Fi are benefiting quite nicely from being exclusive on Amazon.(Take back your writing time with this free marketing toolkit)According to the Wall Street Journal, Amazon ‚Äúowns the system.‚Äù This translates into about 83% of the U.S. book market. I‚Äôm not a fan of betting it all on one but for now, at least, Amazon is the place to be if you want to at least try to make any money as an indie author.That being said, you can still make money on Amazon without KDP Select and publish in other markets. The lack of inherent promotional opportunities will hinder you but that can be made up for if you have a concerted, focused marketing strategy.You can stick it to the man and go wide, which would require a ton more marketing work but might be better in the long run. Or you could bow at the feet of the ‚ÄòZon and establish your career now, learning only one ads platform and choose to go wide later.For more on this, check out the Alliance of Independent Author‚Äôs take here.* * *If you want to take back your writing time, stick around.

Willpower Is Gold. Don‚Äôt Waste It.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/willpower-is-gold-dont-waste-it-f6df46dada1f,Aaron Blum,86,6,1299,"How much willpower do you have right now, at this moment?If you are like me, you probably don‚Äôt know how to answer this question. We do not often think about willpower as something to be measured. It is not often we reflect on the supply of resolve that we have available.I‚Äôm here to tell you, this is something you need to be thinking about.Willpower is a precious resource. If we are not aware of how much we have or how we are using it, it will be gobbled up by the whims and fancies of others or the constant pressures of life.I used to think that willpower could be summoned at my beck and call. I had an optimism about the supply of my resolve. I thought I could do anything I put my mind to. When tackling a difficult task, I would grunt under my breath, ‚Äúwhere there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way‚Äù or the pastor‚Äôs kid version, ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚ÄùThis kind of optimistic thinking works great on day 1 of a new diet. But by day 8, when my spoon started scraping the bottom of the ice cream tub, it was a reminder of my weakness. Thinking that I could summon willpower whenever I needed it only lead to shame and guilt. There have been so many points in my life where I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThis shouldn‚Äôt be so difficult. What‚Äôs wrong with me? Am I some kind of loser?‚Äù My feelings of shame would only further deplete my willpower causing even the simplest of habits to become an incredible feat, like climbing up a mountain. Building habits like waking up early to meditate or eating a healthy breakfast became a slog as I regularly depleted my stores of willpower with shame and negative self-talk.I was freed from this shame cycle when I came to this realization:Willpower is limited.Like the battery on our phones, it drains constantly and there is only so much available in a given day. Whenever we have to make decisions, whenever we try to solve a problem, whenever we process our thoughts or emotions, whenever we have to choose long-term gain over short-term pleasure, our willpower is getting used up.The issue is not a lack of willpower. The issue is the ability to properly allocate the limited willpower we have for maximum impact.Running out of willpower doesn‚Äôt make us weak. It makes us human. No one has an unlimited store of resolve just waiting to be put into action.Success happens when we treat our willpower like gold and use it sparingly towards accomplishing our purpose ‚Äî the one thing that matters most.If you are like me, you may be thinking, ‚ÄúHow do I improve my ability to allocate willpower?‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm glad you asked‚Ä¶Decide everyday what are the things you want to direct your willpower towards and what the things are that you do not want to direct your willpower towards. Make a list of the areas you want to invest your willpower (like building strong habits) and a list of the things that are a black hole for willpower (like trying to always have zero unread emails in your inbox). Personally, I make the decision daily to direct my willpower towards building a writing habit. If you do not decide where you put your willpower, other people will do it for you. Don‚Äôt be a victim to the demands of others and the pull of circumstances. Take control. Decide.I recently read a book called ‚ÄúThe One Thing‚Äù by Gary Keller and it has helped me tremendously get focused and allocate my willpower effectively. I use the focus question to recenter me on what is most important.‚ÄúWhat is the one thing I can do such by doing it everything else becomes easier or unnecessary?‚ÄùThis question gets my brain spinning on the one activity that has the most leverage. The one domino that if I can just push over with a little willpower, it starts a chain reaction.You have heard it a million times in a million ways ‚Äî ‚Äúsuccessful people have good habits‚Äù. It‚Äôs so freaking true. But successful people also know how important it is to build one habit at a time. Building a habit takes up a huge amount of willpower. When we build habits, we are writing a new script for what normal looks like. While we are writing this script, it takes enormous effort to live out the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, while the ‚Äúold normal‚Äù has a tantrum like a toddler in timeout. If we try to build more than one habit at once, our resolve gas-tank will deplete quickly until we are running on fumes. Whatever habit is harder to do, will be the first one to be dropped.But building one habit a time creates a snowball effect. For instance, over the past year I have built a habit of running 4 times a week after work. When I first started building this habit, it was rough. I would get home from work and lay down on the couch while I stared at my running shoes by the door for 15‚Äì20 minutes. My mind would race through every excuse imaginable, but the most common one was the weather (it always seems to be raining in Seattle). Now that I have built the habit, I don‚Äôt think about it. I get home, lace-up, put a leash on the dog, and GO. Rain or shine, it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. Strong habits eat excuses for breakfast. Now that I have built this habit, it has positively influenced every aspect of my life. I have more energy, I crave better nutrition, I sleep better, I am more joyful, and I am more present. I can now use my willpower on building the next habit ‚Äî writing 500 words every day (and this one is requiring even more willpower than running).The best way to suck up all your willpower and get nothing done is to have a completely open schedule and have no plan for how you spend your time. Just like we have to decide where our willpower goes, we also have to decide where our time goes. If there is no plan for our time, we have to make decisions minute by minute. This constant decision making drains our willpower so by the time the afternoon comes around, all we can do is scroll through our slack messages and answer meaningless emails and we miss out on doing deep work. When we time block, we allocate every minute of our day towards the things that matter. When we make all the hard decisions up-front of where we will spend our time, it frees us up the rest of the day to be productive.Although willpower is a limited resource, it‚Äôs also a renewable resource. Once we are aware of our supply of willpower and know how to allocate it, we can then focus on activities that renew our willpower. I renew my willpower by getting out in nature, playing board games, spending quality time with my partner, and eating really good food. What is the one thing you can do that would renew your willpower the most? Now, make time for it.Do you feel ashamed about a lack of willpower?Find freedom in this ‚Äî your willpower is limited.There is a freedom in this truth but there is also responsibility. You can choose to use it on the things that really matter, or you can let life decide for you.Your willpower is gold, don‚Äôt waste it. Allocate it like it is the most precious thing you possess. Decide where you put it, get focused, build one habit at a time, time block and renew your supply.And live the life of purpose that you were created for.",25/07/2019,0,0,6,2,1050,1575,1,0,0,2,19

I am simply collecting ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù resume boosters like seashells at this point. Recently, I have decided to enter the gig economy as a creative. Each day I feel more fulfilled than the last. However, I don‚Äôt get the luxury of a concrete answer to the dreaded question: ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù. It‚Äôs fine because I choose this for myself, right?Wrong. I‚Äôm an empath. People‚Äôs immediate worries intertwine with my own before I can even begin to explain how I spend my days. This instantly sparks a wave of self-doubt as I string together sentences that loosely defends my decisions. This inevitably provokes the second dreaded question: ‚ÄúBut how do you make money?‚Äù.‚ÄúHell if I know.‚Äù I reply, summarizing that I‚Äôm new to this, that I‚Äôm learning and lastly that I‚Äôm scared and insecure in my ability to do so.

But as of recent, it has been trying for my mental health. My hope is to spark curiosity and promise for a new age of quality conversations. So, instead of defaulting to ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù, consider getting to know someone with the following:‚ÄúHow are you?‚ÄùSimple and genuine.

So when I was invited to attend his Seminal master class, I ponied up a huge amount of money to attend. I was the only participant who wasn‚Äôt doing this to be successful in a business ‚Äî I did it because I want to help people lead happier, more meaningful lives, and this seminar would help me reach a lot more people.‚ÄúWhy I stopped writing‚Äù reason #1: I stopped writing because I needed to learn the new skills I would need to be more successful. For example, I know that the article‚Äôs title, subtitle, picture, and first sentence make a huge difference ‚Äî so I spent extra time on all of them for these articles. I also used techniques to keep you reading more. (If you‚Äôve read this far, then we‚Äôve both won!)The class made me feel deeply anxious all the time.Why would I sign up for something that made me dread each new day?From my training and my own self-examination, I know that I have learned how to change and what it feels like, and how failure is invaluable feedback that makes success possible. Most important, I know that perseverance is necessary to reach any worthwhile goal. And when in the future I wonder whether I should try to do something really hard, I can tell myself, ‚ÄúI got through that master class, so I can do this too.‚Äù‚ÄúWhy‚Äù reason #2: I stopped writing because I know that pushing myself beyond what I‚Äôm comfortable with is the only way I can learn to do great things.I could have taken a dozen classes that would make me more successful in several parts of my life, all for the same amount of money.Why did I take this class instead of the others?Getting through this master class was grueling, but it was also exhilarating. It reminds me of my four years of graduate school in counseling psychology. Each course I took gave me new words for thinking about things, new ways to consider how a client‚Äôs past might be influencing their behavior today.And the same was true with this class. I now know about titles and ‚Äúpulling‚Äù the reader forward and so much more. I have new words that help with writing but also in other areas. I can ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the ‚Äòtitle‚Äô of my life?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow can I ‚Äòpull‚Äô my wife into a more emotionally satisfying marriage?‚Äù‚ÄúWhy‚Äù reason #3: I stopped writing because I knew the this class would lead me further down my journey of self-improvement, something that has for decades made me happier and more satisfied with my life.When the class ended in mid-May, I was exhausted. And this wasn‚Äôt an ending to anything ‚Äî it was the beginning of writing better. Now I have to start working in an entirely new way, one that will at first make me feel stupid and clumsy and slow. But I know that with practice, ‚ÄúThis feels impossible‚Äù leads to ‚ÄúThis feels doable‚Äù, and from there to ‚ÄúThis feels natural‚Äù.Life is exciting and challenging again. I know that all the articles I‚Äôm about to write ‚Äî for the rest of my life ‚Äî will be much better than everything I‚Äôve written in my entire life.So, I‚Äôm writing again.I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next.",25/07/2019,0,0,3,13,1050,700,1,0,0,7,59

Your imaginary boundaries are holding back your team.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/your-imaginary-boundaries-are-holding-back-your-team-727e80040982,Rancho Encino,176,4,716,"In my corporate career, I liked to think of my team as a family. It was my job to make sure the team thrived and moved in a positive direction. As the leader, I made decisions for them that I felt would move us forward.As I think back, was I really listening to my team or was I dictating what I thought was best? Was I placing boundaries on them that didn‚Äôt exist?my program, Lead2life, clients lead a horse through obstacles in order to achieve an objective. There are many times that my clients are given rules to follow, but just as many where there are none. It is in those times where there are no rules, that most of my clients create their own imaginary boundaries.medium.comDuring the session, I will say, ‚ÄúThe only boundary you have is you can‚Äôt go over the pole including your horse‚Äù. The clients will all assume that what that means is they can‚Äôt go inside the box. What I said was, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go over the pole‚Äù. The client places a boundary on themselves that doesn‚Äôt exist.There are clear ways to go inside the box without going over the poles, but the client has to be thinking about creative solutions. They can‚Äôt hold themselves back with rules that aren‚Äôt there.This exercise is done early in our sessions. It‚Äôs interesting to note that as my clients progress through the program, they learn to think outside the box and their creativity is amazing; however, in the beginning, they always hold themselves back with boundaries and rules that they themselves create.In this exercise, there is a team of three, the two clients leading the horse and the horse. The objective is communication but it also involves teamwork.I had one client group that illustrated how the leader can completely stifle creative thinking by not listening and not including everyone in the team. This group created barriers that didn‚Äôt exist and completely ignored the horse when he was speaking through his body language. This failure in communication with everyone in the team is the difference between reaching their goals and completely missing the mark.The team of three was working through the obstacle. The clients are baffled about how to get the horse to turn around. They are talking amongst themselves about possible solutions and completely ignore the horse. The horse gets bored and starts to walk out of the boundaries showing them a solution. The team stops the horse and continues talking.As the facilitator, I step in and ask the team what they think the horse is saying to them and are they listening to everyone in the team?Now the team focuses on what the horse is saying and the consequences of not including everyone in the team when coming up with solutions. They realize their horse, an important member of their team, was showing them a solution. They had stopped the horse from showing them and completely ignored him.In the debrief, they talked about how they should have trusted their third team member and listened when he offered a solution. They also realized they were the leaders and they were holding back the team with rules that were not there and should have been coming up with more creative solutions.medium.comReal-life application:Each year the VP of Human Resources hires talented young executives who are recent college graduates.

How Winning the Lottery Would Ruin My Life,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-winning-the-lottery-would-ruin-my-life-66f4df9bce70,"Sarah Dergins, LCSW",23,5,1022,"Everyone‚Äôs wired a little bit different. I, like my father, am wired a bit on the neurotic side (sorry Dad, but a tiger can‚Äôt change its stripes). My dad retired several years ago and has held more jobs in retirement than some people do in a lifetime. He likes working, he likes making a difference, he likes waking up with a sense of purpose.My husband is a man who knows how to relax. I envy him, in a way. When he is sick, he will stay on the couch, have junk food, and watch movies until he feels better.When I am sick, or in the recent case of severely spraining my ankle, I will spend the next day putting weight on it and painting our fence because in my mind, painting is a stationary activity, and if I have to be stationary, at least I can be productive. Two weeks post-sprain and the ankle is still inflated. I reckon‚Äô my method of ‚Äúrest‚Äù is not the most effective.I come from a family of farmers and scholars. The two don‚Äôt seem like they go hand-in hand, but they have more in common then you‚Äôd think. Hard work is a way of life. Hard work was ingrained from my father‚Äôs side of the family, who were immigrants who had to excel in education in order to get hired anywhere. Hard work was ingrained in my mother‚Äôs family through generations of farmers where work meant the difference between eating and not. These lessons passed down the ladder, so I get it honestly.Rest is a difficult thing for me to do. It‚Äôs always been tough. Sure, hard work is something I‚Äôve seen modeled through my parents, grandparents, and relatives, but on a deeper level my constant drive towards productivity is a direct reflection of issues around my own self-worth. On a gut level I have this sense that if I push harder, work harder, create more, or do more, I would feel like I‚Äôm worth something.Over the weekend, I was talking to my brother about the concept of ‚Äúself-worth‚Äù. Puzzled, he cocked his head to the side and said, ‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶I never thought about my worth. Thinking if I have value or not has literally never crossed my mind.‚Äù‚ÄúOh to be a man,‚Äù I thought.Men aren‚Äôt immune to issues around self-worth, but through socialization it seems issues around worth have been pounded into women.I‚Äôm not alone in this thought process. And years later, as a therapist and a person who has spent years doing my own work on issues around self-worth, I know intellectually, that I am worth a whole lot. On days when I‚Äôm sick, or injured, or fuzzy-brained, I find it hard to remember. I know most of the CBT, mindfulness, and thought challenging tricks in the book, and yet there are still days where my productivity feels like it is the measuring stick for my personal value. I know it‚Äôs a false ruler, but my brain tends to default there none the less.My recent injury, or perhaps my initial response of intolerance towards it coupled with four days off for a holiday, got me thinking about what it would be like to win the lottery. I‚Äôve played the lottery (probably more than I‚Äôd like to admit), but for the first time I thought, ‚ÄúWould I actually even want to win?‚ÄùSure it‚Äôd be great to ensure my family is provided for, travel, set up a foundation, etc. but if I‚Äôm being honest, I know that winning the lottery would not fulfill my deepest sense of purpose for being on this Earth. There are ways to do immeasurable good with money, and that‚Äôs what I would hope to do, but when I‚Äôm operating from a wise place (few and far between), I know money would not bring the fulfillment I desire.Yet neither would work, in its entirety. I‚Äôve lived many years in waiting for accolades and accomplishment to finally fill my soul with worth. I‚Äôve given and given in an effort to feel better about myself, and while I am grateful for those times of service I realize that no amount of giving, doing, creating, or producing will fill up that jar with coins of self-worth.My recent injury has led me to explore satisfaction and meaning. I have often measured a good day by the number of miles I biked or ran, the amount of paragraphs I wrote, and the care of my lawn. Yet over the past 2 weeks of being unable to ‚Äúget things done‚Äù in the physical sense, I‚Äôve found a new kind of freedom. I realize the tether that productivity has had (and still fights for) on my life.The moment I heard the pops in my ankle, I looked up to the sky. It started to rain and I had about a mile and a half to hobble before I reached my car. So I cried, not from pain, but from the frustration of knowing I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to be in the woods or run for a while. I immediately looked up, shaking my head and said, ‚ÄúI know why this is happening, I know it‚Äôs time for growth, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I like it.‚Äù I cried at the frustration of my own resistance and rigidity.And now I sit, leg propped up in a coffee shop, typing away and thinking even now of productivity, of ‚Äútaking advantage‚Äù of sitting. But for today, I think I‚Äôm going to ease into the day, take in the warmth of the sun, the coolness of an icepack on the old ankle, and the creaminess of my coffee. I‚Äôm going to look at the toddlers below me playing Connect Four and reflect on the time spent with my nephews last weekend as we giggled and attempted to play the same game.At the end of the day, we could produce the great American Novel, discover the cure to various diseases, or sit as a prisoner in a cell for the rest of our lives. Neither the laureate, the lottery winner, nor the inmate are worth any different in the end, and neither are we.",25/07/2019,0,0,1,1,851,762,3,0,0,0,11
Are You Too Scared to Start Investing?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-too-scared-to-start-investing-1801cb663735,Joseph Brown,1400,11,2311,"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt earn your way to freedom.‚Äù (Tony Robbins)If you want to have huge wealth and become financially free (as in not having to work at all) you need to start investing.What follows are the lessons I‚Äôve learned about how to overcome my fear of investing, from Tony Robbin‚Äôs book Unshakeable. All thanks to Tony and I recommend you all go out and get a copy.I‚Äôm studying this because investing is part of my plan for success. I‚Äôm sharing it to help those who were like me; people who dream of achieving great success but are too scared to risk seeking the financial rewards of investing.My goal is to become unshakeable and to achieve the level of confidence that will allow me to be master of my financial life.Unshakeable means having the power to stay in control when you are faced with fear and doubt.(To learn more about the concept of unshakeable in investing and life read Part 1 here.)To put it in the same metaphorical terms that Tony does, it is to know that winter is coming, there will be bad times, but after winter comes spring. It‚Äôs to know that the market is cyclical and that what goes up will come down, but it will go back up again.So if you put your money into good, safe investments, then there‚Äôs no need to panic. In the long run the trend has always been up. Humans aren‚Äôt going out of business anytime soon. So the winning strategy is to buy good, play long, and avoid the fear that gets others to throw away their money.But fear is one hell of a beast. We as humans are biologically programmed to fear. This fear is what has kept us alive for hundreds of very dangerous years. However, this programming has us seeing danger everywhere. The slightest risk and our defenses are up. The problem is, if you know how to overcome that fear, learn how to manage risk, and make smart investments, then you can become the master of your destiny.Fear is the major pitfall that stops and hinders investors. We need to be aware of it and we need to actively work to overcome it.Fear is what drives amateur investors to stop before they even start and beginner investors to throw away all the advantages when they get scared and run away.Overcome the fear by following these principles to becoming an unshakeable investor.In order to overcome fear, you need to have a system. You need to have a set of guiding principles that you trust. So even when the sky is falling, you know that you‚Äôve done the right thing and you can have faith that in the long run you will come out on top.This is how the great investors do it. They know there will come a time when their resolve is tested. They may not know what the market is doing or they may have a loss of confidence. Perhaps they are not sure about conflicting information. In these cases, they rely on the lessons they have learned. From their lessons and experiences they develop principles that guide them. Principles they can trust will guide them safely through the unknowns of the market.From his study of the greats, Tony offers four key principles to help guide our investments.To guide investment decisions you need to know the principles.This relates to all areas of life. In business and personal life, if you understand the principles and you stick to a smart game plan, then you can achieve success at anything.As Tony states: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the most successful people in any field aren‚Äôt just lucky. They have a different set of beliefs. They have a different strategy.‚Äù (Robbins P. 95)So here are the core principles to follow in investing:This sounds pretty straight forward. Investing is about making money. No one is actively trying to lose money. However, what happens is that many investors go into the market looking to make big returns fast. They are eager to win big, so they are more likely to take on big risk.Also, beginner investors are more likely to follow trends. They will chop and change their investments. Often, they may take a small loss to sell so they can get into a more attractive investment. Meanwhile, accepting the fees and charges that go with a high buy/sell count on their investment account.Furthermore, fearful beginning investors are also very susceptible to the fear of a correction and will cut and run when things turn bad. This is a bad loss, when many times they should hold on and wait for the rebound.What experienced investors know is that risk means potential loss. And the best investors hate to lose money. For every loss you make, it becomes harder to get back. For example, a 50% loss is a big hit. But in order to get that back, you don‚Äôt need a 50% gain, you need a 100% gain to win it back.So the first principle is, always guard against risk.According to Ray Dalio, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ we should never forget: we have to design an asset allocation that ensures we‚Äôll ‚Äústill be ok,‚Äù even when we‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù (Robbins p.98)To achieve this asset allocation is the key. This simply means having the right mix of different asset types to reduce your risks and maximize rewards. (Robbins p.99)It means playing the long game and setting up an investment portfolio that will work for you even when everything is going wrong. A mix of investments that combine both slow and steady and the potential for quick gain. A combination of assets that move in different directions, so when one is down, another is up.We will cover asset allocation at a later date. But the overall lesson is that professional investors aren‚Äôt looking for one off big wins. They are looking to build a money making machine that will minimize risk and maximize rewards.My wife and I have learned these lessons and we are starting to put together our own portfolio with a varied asset allocation.It‚Äôs not fast and at times it is frustrating. But we know if we want the big long term rewards, we need to start small and start with safe. We can build on that to get to more returns when we have a solid foundation.The second principle shows us that the rewards must outweigh the risk. Your asset allocation must be balanced, so that your winning investments easily make up for any losing investments.We know that we can‚Äôt win all the time. However, we also know we can‚Äôt lose all the time.So when we do take on risk, that risk needs to be balanced against our other investments.Also, the risk needs to be worth it. If you risk one dollar to make 10c, a 10% return, you‚Äôre risking it all for a low return. If you have five investments of one dollar, all looking to make 10c, then your potential return is 50c.However, if one of your investments loses, then you only get 40c. Also, you lose the dollar you put down. So that leaves you with $4.40, less than the original $5.This is a very simple explanation, and obviously misses much of the complexity of the market. The point is, if you are going to take on risk it needs to be worth it and it needs to be balanced against all the rest.Here, Tony quotes Paul Tudor Jones to illustrate his strategy of a five-to-one rule. He argues that he doesn‚Äôt risk a dollar unless the reward is potentially five dollars:‚ÄúI‚Äôm risking one dollar in the expectation that I‚Äôll make five ‚Ä¶ What five-to-one does is allow you to have a hit ratio of 20%. I can actually be a compete imbecile. I can be wrong 80% of the time, and I‚Äôm still not going to lose.‚Äù (Robbins P. 101)I feel this is a little beyond me at the moment.We‚Äôve just started to invest our money and we‚Äôre still taking it very safe and building slow, safe stocks and looking to diversify this year into land.However, I see the strategy going forward. As we have established our safe portfolio we will look to improve our returns by taking on some more risky investments. And this does make sense as a good strategy.Don‚Äôt risk it unless the reward is worth it. If you are going to risk it, balance that risk against other options so even if you‚Äôre wrong, the one time you‚Äôre right will make up for it.As investors, we need to acknowledge that taxes are an expense. They can take away a sizeable chunk of our earnings. Especially if you‚Äôre a high earner, that chunk can be rather sizeable.Investors know: ‚ÄúThey know that it‚Äôs not what they earn that counts. It‚Äôs what they keep.‚Äù (Robbins p.105)So, for every investment, we as investors need to ask, what is the tax expense?Now, I‚Äôm not an expert on tax. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve studied or even really given a lot of thought too, beyond complaining about it and hoping my tax return is good.At the moment, tax isn‚Äôt a big problem for our small portfolio. However, having learnt our lessons, we are aware of the fees and taxes we pay and it‚Äôs a question we ask before we make any changes.Going forward, it‚Äôs an area we need to put time into, or we need to be prepared to hire an expert.However, for some the idea of dealing with the paperwork and taxes is yet another reason why they don‚Äôt get into investing. For these people they don‚Äôt understand the system and the idea that agents are going to take commissions and the tax man is going to come calling is another fear that stops them from getting started.I understand this fear as I used to think the same way.But now, thanks in large part to my wife, I‚Äôm learning that all that fear is in my head. It‚Äôs never as big and ominous as we make it out to be in our minds. We got started, we got some advice and then we started trading. After a few weeks we started to learn the costs of doing business and we made it part of our decision making process. And going forward we‚Äôll learn more.Either way, it‚Äôs something to aware of and to take into account, but to let the fear of taxes and charges stop you from learning the method by which you can free your life seems pretty silly to me now.Diversification is how you reduce risk. We all know that every investment has risk. That‚Äôs why you get a reward. You get a cash reward because you are risking your money in the public, sometimes dangerous, open market. By spreading your money around to different investments, you reduce the risk that you could lose it all by having it all in the one place.1) Diversify across classes ‚Äî for example buying not just stocks, but buying stocks, bonds, futures, currencies, gold etc.2) Diversify within classes ‚Äî don‚Äôt just buy one stock or type of stock. You need a variety of stocks.3) Diversify across markets, countries and currencies around the world. Don‚Äôt invest all your money in one market and one country. By sharing it among different markets and countries, you reduce your risk. If one country is effected by a tragic occurrence, you are not so badly at risk as you have an allocation of assets in another unaffected area.4) Diversify across time ‚Äî You are never going to get the timing perfect, but over months and years across different classes you average out the risk/reward. This is called dollar-cost averaging, which basically means, sometimes you get it right and some times you get it wrong, but it all averages out over time. And as the overall trend is generally up, you‚Äôll usually end up going in the right direction.Diversification is your insurance policy. One day you may face a big loss. By having diversity in your investments, it allows you to react as assets respond differently to market actions.‚ÄúRay [Dalio] emphasizes that, by owning 15 uncorrelated investments, you can reduce your overall risk ‚Äúby about 80%,‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll increase the return-to-risk ratio by a factor of five. So, your return is five times greater by reducing risk.‚Äù‚Äù (Robbins P.112)To be unshakeable in what is essentially a risky market, you need to have tried and true principles to guide your actions.If you follow the proper guiding principles, you can be confident that no single big hit will sink your financial goals.You will be prepared for the dangers and you won‚Äôt react emotionally to what are actually logical and financial problems. You will be able to react with intelligence and save yourself from the pitfalls of investing.Beyond that, if you follow the principle of good investing, you set up a money machine that has the strength and flexibility to respond to negative situations and to keep making you a return.By creating your asset allocation portfolio, you have the power to make strategic decisions at times of worry. For example, shares drop and you worry your value is falling. But if you have assets over different classes, this worry becomes a simple calculation.My shares are down, that means they‚Äôre cheap. Conversely, my negatively correlated assets, say bonds are likely to be up. So, by readjusting, I sell my high priced bonds and buy more cheap priced stocks and thus win in the conversion. It‚Äôs basic buy low, sell high.Follow these principles and start building your cash machine today.It‚Äôs your ticket to financial freedom, to living life on your terms and to being unshakeable.Thanks for allowing me to share and remember to never stop striving to achieve your image of success.Stay tuned next week for my last lessons from Tony‚Äôs Unshakeable.If you liked these basic ideas on investing, please read more at How to Achieve Financial Freedom through Investing.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,6,1050,891,5,1,0,12,25

I thought it was because I was always available, played well with the kids, and cleaned up the messes. Now, I think it was also because I was the bargain of the century. At a dollar an hour, I was a steal! Granted, this was the early 80s, and none of my friends were making more than two ‚Äî three dollars an hour to sit, but I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to charge that!You could argue that the people who hired me could have done the right thing and offered to pay me more, but really, the responsibility was mine. And I think a lot of artists will relate to my reasons for not wanting to raise my rate.1) I was afraid I‚Äôd lose those jobs. 2) I worried if I asked for more, they‚Äôd see me as greedy or I‚Äôd cause them distress. 3) I thought I was doing them a kindness; that by keeping my rates low, I was enabling them to get out and enjoy themselves. 4) I felt like I was just a kid and probably didn‚Äôt deserve more money anyway.Are you still writing articles for no pay thinking you ‚Äúneed‚Äù the byline?

How to Improve Your Work Ethic and Feel Fulfilled in Your Career,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-improve-your-work-ethic-and-feel-fulfilled-in-your-career-18d074ad436a,Alisa Wilson,60,7,1497,"Tom Cruise and Don Johnson wanted a picture with me. They each motioned for me to step forward, and butterflies battered the inside of my stomach. Earlier in the evening, I assumed that the crowd around them would not disperse before the night‚Äôs end, barring my chance for a photo. That was okay ‚Äî I felt content to watch the spectacle of their presence from a distance. The convention offered many other fun distractions, and besides, a picture with celebrities was something other people were brave enough to go after, not me.‚ÄúCan my daughter get a picture?‚Äù My dad flashed a winning smile at the stars‚Äô photographer. The photographer grinned and said sure, though it was late and the trio were on their way from the convention hall.‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Tom Cruise smiled at me from behind his aviator sunglasses and put his arm around my shoulder. Don Johnson was too cool to say anything to me, in his trademark tank top and blazer with the rolled-up sleeves (just like he wore in Miami Vice), and guided me between them with an arm around my waist. I checked my dress and my hair ‚Äî everything appeared to be in place.The San Diego bay, twinkling in the heat of a summer night, faded into the background as I stepped between the two Hollywood icons. The convention‚Äôs crowd had thinned, and we ‚Äî my mom, dad, brother, and I ‚Äî were among the last to leave. No surprise there. My parents, ‚Äúa striking couple,‚Äù always arrived home late from my dad‚Äôs business functions. They usually didn‚Äôt bring my brother and I along, but this time they said that we wouldn‚Äôt want to miss it.The photographer counted down and took our picture. I was impressed by how much these two ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù resembled their true-life counterparts, though more so from afar than up close. My dad joked with them as the photographer pulled the picture from the polaroid camera and handed it to me. I stared at its developing image and smiled as it came into focus. I could definitely fool my friends. I went from feeling embarrassed by my dad for asking for the picture to grateful that he‚Äôd pushed me to step forward.Merriam Webster defines work ethic as ‚Äúa belief in work as a moral good. A set of values centered on the importance of doing work and reflected especially in a desire or determination to work hard.‚Äù Though my dad described his work ethic in simple terms (‚ÄúI just tried to work a little harder than the next guy‚Äù), I knew ‚Äòthe next guy‚Äô included everyone else ‚Äî which meant long hours at the office and frequent travel. My dad‚Äôs high-stress job in sales had many compensatory benefits, however, like the convention in San Diego and a business summit in Hawaii that included each salespersons‚Äô immediate family. Most significantly, my mom could choose to be a stay-at-home mom. Today, as a single parent, I have a special appreciation for the stability and abundance I enjoyed in my adolescence, thanks to my dad‚Äôs strong work ethic.When I first started out in my career, I defined my work ethic goals by my dad‚Äôs example ‚Äî diligence, integrity, committing to your employer‚Äôs goals, arriving early, staying late, and going for the promotion. My dad said he hired people that were smarter than him, with the intent to learn from them. He supported his employees‚Äô educational goals, and then promoted them. In short, my dad embodied the principle that hard work carried its own virtue and worthiness of reward, but also that work-related stress and anxiety went hand-in-hand with success.Yet, despite what I admired about my dad‚Äôs work ethic, I never wanted to emulate my dad‚Äôs approach to his career. Instead, I imagined that I would be naturally good at my ideal profession, whatever it was. I would utilize my originality and creativity, and rarely encounter work-related stress. Like-minded people would gravitate to me, and I would easily earn the admiration of my peers. Until then, if I struggled too much in a job, it would mean that I wasn‚Äôt right for what I was doing, and that I should move on. A boring, restrictive, and demanding office job like my dad‚Äôs, despite the apparent financial and other benefits, was not for me. But I felt conflicted ‚Äî if I didn‚Äôt adopt my dad‚Äôs work ethic, then would I be as successful? Did my daydreams about my ideal job reflect a poor work ethic? Was there a middle-ground mindset?Carol Dweck, accomplished Stanford psychologist and author of Mindset, would identify my first thoughts about work ethic as the product of a fixed mindset. In many ways, a fixed mindset explains my quirky career path and, until recently, my overall dissatisfaction with my career. According to Dweck, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their personal qualities ‚Äî intelligence, morality, and talents ‚Äî are fixed, unchangeable, and unlikely to improve. This rang true for my past self ‚Äî I believed that I had certain aptitudes that I could strengthen, but never replace with others. I believed I must find a job that was a perfect fit for me. This led to repeated feelings of inadequacy, and a drive to prove myself, over and over‚Ä¶ which led to decreasing resilience, and burnout.Someone with a growth mindset, per Dweck, believes that the genes they‚Äôre dealt at birth (or any plateaus they encounter during their career) are only the starting point. Once I looked at my work ethic through the lens of a growth mindset, I realized that by choice and determination, I could cultivate diligence and resilience and hone my intelligence and aptitudes. A struggle with a task did not indicate my inability, but an area full of growth potential. In a growth mindset, failure is nothing more than the first step toward self-improvement.I now look back at my career and see that life has been trying to teach me, one struggle at a time, precisely what I needed to learn. What I love most about Mindset is the idea that a fixed mindset is not fixed. We can switch paths and choose the way of a growth-mindset master. The first step is to use this new growth mindset to redefine your own work ethic.Now that I know about the two mindsets, I find myself consciously switching to a growth mindset several times a day. For example, when confronted with a last-minute catering and planning request for a company get-together, my usual reaction would be: I can‚Äôt plan a good event in this short a timeframe! This is going to be a disaster! I don‚Äôt even like to attend these things! Now, I let those thoughts drift away, and then I think, okay, this could be fun, and a great chance to network and connect with my co-workers. I‚Äôm going to plan this as well as I can, and then let the unexpected happen, and learn from it.I realize now that my primary work ethic illusion was that my work ought to be perfect. I also mistakenly believed that what I didn‚Äôt accomplish at work defined me, and that, in order to nurture a strong work ethic, I must spend a lot of time away from home. Finally, in rethinking the idea of a universal and ideal work ethic, I sought some advice. Carmen Duncan, gifted career coach and head of Mission Accomplished Transition Services, set me straight.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have different work ethics, depending on the job,‚Äù Carmen told me. ‚ÄúYour approach is going to differ whether you work for Google, or a museum. You want to be reliable, but even the expectation of showing up is going to differ from one industry to another. I wouldn‚Äôt want to generalize it. I‚Äôm passionate about having industry-specific conversations.‚Äù Once Carmen said this, I thought, of course, your work ethic is as individual as you are.Therefore, with Carmen‚Äôs advice and a growth-mindset in mind, to find and improve your own personalized work ethic, and reach for a higher level of fulfillment at work, ask yourself these questions:A final note ‚Äî even as I redefine and personalize my work ethic, I will continue to employ two significant strategies from my dad‚Äôs work ethic playbook: determination, and a willingness to strive. My dad, though an introvert like me, was not a wallflower. Whenever he saw an opportunity to shine, he took it, and pushed me to do the same, encouraging me to reach for the stars ‚Äî even if they were really just a pair of look-alikes.This article is one in a series on lessons I learned during my quirky career path. Topics include job-interview blunders, how easy it is to get fired, and a better mindset for mistakes, to name a few.Feeling overwhelmed or unfulfilled at work?

Living the holiday life,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/living-the-holiday-life-b21fb32551e2,Sharon Flitman,35,4,777,"The average Australian worker gets 4 weeks of holiday a year.Just 4 weeks. That means vacationing constitutes only 7.6 percent of our working lives.As if the numbers weren‚Äôt already unbalanced enough, it feels as though the 48 working weeks dribble by at the pace of an arthritic sloth, while the heavenly holiday weeks disappear faster than the chocolate biscuits from my kitchen pantry.Clearly we can‚Äôt rely upon this limited allocation of freedom for enduring happiness.But lately I‚Äôve been thinking. What is it that‚Äôs so great about holidays anyway? And more importantly, is it possible to experience the joys of a vacation without physically vacating a job / life / country?Personally, I reckon it‚Äôs within the realm of possibility. Because like most things in life, I don‚Äôt believe we humans love holidays because of their intrinsic value.No ‚Äî I think we love them because of how they make us think, feel and act.NoveltyThe link between novelty and dopamine release has been well established.When we go, see, or do something new, our brains tend to flood with a wave of dopamine, which lights up the reward centres and makes us feel gooooood. And like anything that makes us feel gooooood, we tend to like novelty rather a lot.Holidays are pretty much the ultimate novelty experiences. When we jet set off to somewhere we‚Äôve never been, we see things we‚Äôve never seen, do things we‚Äôve never done, meet people we‚Äôve never met, and sample flavours we‚Äôve never encountered.Holiday are basically a non-stop dopamine ejaculating, novelty-induced, neurological pleasure feeding frenzy.But an exotic trip away is not the only way to attain the dopaminergic gratification our brains so greedily crave. We don‚Äôt need to fly to far flung corners of the globe in order to see, do, meet and eat new things.Something as simple as a bike ride through a previously uncharted home town suburb can spark a dopamine spike. A spontaneous trip to an unfamiliar part of the local countryside can do the same. As can a night out at a new restaurant. A life drawing class. Salsa dancing lessons.Heck, I once just drove a different way to work and was rewarded with a surprise boulevard of spectacular autumnal trees.The potential for novelty in everyday life is endless. We just need to remember to seek it out.Holiday eyesHave you ever noticed how on holidays everything becomes instantly fascinating? We ‚Äúoooh‚Äù over beautiful architecture, and ‚Äúahh‚Äù over cute marketplace trinkets.Somehow, we rarely give such features in our home towns a second glance, let alone marvel in awe as we wander the streets. Yet hundreds of thousands of people flock to our cities specifically to ogle our beautiful architecture and marketplace trinkets.There must be something we‚Äôre just not seeing.As a relatively new photography enthusiast, I recently learned the joy of viewing the local landscape as through the eyes of a tourist.With camera in hand, I wandered the streets of my suburb, seeking wonder and beauty to capture for posterity. And I was astounded by the wonders that lay waiting to be discovered.RelaxationMost of us return from holidays feeling serene and re-energised. But relaxation is not just a by-product of reclining on a beach.We feel relaxed on holidays because we allow ourselves to relax. Sipping a tropical refreshment overlooking a pristine seascape, we convince our busy brain to just shut the hell up for 5 minutes; to cease ruminating over unfinished chores, work deadlines, and general life logistics.For this reason alone, the stress melts away with the ice in the pina colada.The best part of all is that our brains are with us 52 weeks a year, allowing us to recreate holiday-brain level relaxation at all times‚Ä¶ with the right tools.Sure, ‚Äòreal life‚Äô stressors are often higher than those we‚Äôre faced with while blissfully sprawled on a sandy beach. But if we really examine it, few ‚Äòreal life‚Äô stresses are stimulated by real or immediate threats.Rather, our minds have a tendency to stew over bad things that happened in the past, or things that might go wrong in the future.Imagine if every day we adopted a holiday mindset instead.Traffic jams would become opportunities to belt out a favourite song along with the radio.Memories of past awkwardness would fade into blissful oblivion, allowing us to enjoy current social exchanges.And life ‚Äî in all of its crazy ups and downs ‚Äî would probably just sort itself out (as it so often has a tendency to do).So yes ‚Äî holidays are a great trigger for ‚Äòbe-in-the-moment‚Äô ness. But they‚Äôre not the only way. And if we can find a way to generalise the holiday mindset into the everyday‚Ä¶Well, we may not even need those 4 weeks off.",25/07/2019,0,0,6,0,789,468,2,0,0,0,19
End Writing Procrastination Now,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/end-writing-procrastination-now-c853804c0e1e,Leann Zotis,884,5,1106,"Procrastination is the writer‚Äôs most ardent and aggressive nemesis (Even worse than writer‚Äôs block)Writer‚Äôs see it all the time. We know the subject. We have a great idea. We may even hold strong to the hope that this latest article/novel/script will finally be the one to send our career skyrocketing to the moon! And we will create that masterpiece, just as soon as:The list potentially goes on and on. Procrastination is the sum total of absolutely ANYTHING and EVERYTHING we can conjure up to fill in the spaces between where we are now and that point where we confront the demons that haunt our writing.  It‚Äôs easy to put off until tomorrow that which we want to avoid doing today. After all, we can easily deceive ourselves into thinking our minds will be free and clear of distractions when/if we can set aside all of those small, nagging side issues.  Everyone has a mental agenda. Sometimes that agenda makes its way to a physical To-Do list; others times it remains festering in the brain. All too often many of the writing goals on that agenda end up dying a slow, dismal death as time and other obligations take priority. Some people are organized and determined to succeed. Others are equally determined but lack the organizational skills necessary to reach their goals in a timely fashion. This is often manifested as procrastination for writers, since any excuse to avoid actual writing will do. Procrastination is little more than a self-imposed list of roadblocks. Often, we put a lot of justification behind these excuses in an effort to ease our guilt. Procrastination is destructive for everyone but it can be particularly detrimental to a writer. What a writer ultimately creates doesn‚Äôt even exist until the words make their way from the writer‚Äôs brain onto the page or screen.  Many writers procrastinate because they feel overwhelmed by the tasks at hand.  Five hundred words! 5,000 words! A completed article! Ten pages! Two chapters! A full novel!Who wouldn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by the constant demand to produce? Where does it end? For a writer, there is no end. As long as the brain continues to function, there will always be more words to generate. Unless, of course, you can manage to fill your hours and days with just about every conceivable activity on the planet.  Every conceivable activity ‚Äî Yeah, that‚Äôs ProcrastinationKNOWING THE ENEMY IS HALF THE BATTLESo, now that we‚Äôve named the enemy for what it is, what can we do about it? It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äújust roll up your sleeves and do it.‚Äù It‚Äôs easy, that is, until you remember you need to go grocery shopping, pick up your friend at the airport or make up that Zumba class you skipped last week. (Notice how many of the activities you use to procrastinate and avoid writing are pretty insignificant in the overall scheme of things?) Writing must be a priority if there is ever to be any hope of longevity and success.  Once you can convince yourself that writing truly is a priority in your life, you will be better able to push aside some of mindless time wasters that plague your productivity. Still, you might be saying right about now ‚Äî ‚ÄúI need to eat‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave my friend stranded‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äúexercise is important to my overall well-being.‚Äù ‚ÄúI must do those things.‚Äù Yes, those things must get done. But not necessarily by you.  STOP SHOULDERING THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLDWhile writing itself is largely a solitary journey, there are ways to delegate some of the grunt work in the rest of your life. Don‚Äôt expect to be both the general and the private in your own personal army. Many grocery stores now offer delivery services. With a few clicks on the app, you can enjoy a pantry full of healthy, satisfying foods in a fraction of the time it would take for you to shop yourself. The relatively small cost for this service is a small price to pay to reclaim hours of productive time. Enlist the help of friends or family to make that airport pick-up. You‚Äôll owe them, but that‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs what friends and family do for each other. The Zumba class? Okay, I‚Äôll give you that one. Exercise is a great stress reliever and can be helpful in freeing your mind from excess clutter. BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT AGENDA?Of course, you still have an agenda that includes both writing activities and procrastination activities. Not every item on that agenda is of equal importance. Learn to tell the difference. Some items have no intrinsic value whatsoever. Learn to identify and eliminate those items. You can only spread yourself so thin. Proper discernment of your goals is key to ending procrastination. Make sure the activities relating to your writing goals occupy at least three of the top five slots on your list of things you must do. Really, let‚Äôs try a little tough love here, you either want it or you don‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt have forever to get those brilliant thoughts of yours into print. Simplify your environment. Distractions make it easy to lose focus. If you need a quiet place to accomplish your goals, turn off background music, shut off your phone and close the door to the outside world. Focus your brain to deal with the task at hand. Break every task down into the smallest, most manageable chunks possible. Five small goals can seem less intimidating than the one larger goal that encompasses all the parts. (One page instead of one chapter ‚Äî 500 words instead of 5,000 ‚Äî one pitch to a website you want to guest post on instead of 10 pitches to every website you can find in a sweeping search) Let others know of your intended goals, (and their role in helping you achieve them). Being accountable to the expectations of others can be a great motivator. Establish a reasonable block of time to devote solely to one specific part of your writing project. Once you begin, stick with your project until you‚Äôre done. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to be interrupted by anything short of a true emergency. TWO FINAL, VITALLY IMPORTANT, POINTSEnvision yourself at the completion of the task. If you can taste the thrill of victory before it‚Äôs an actual reality you will be more motivated to get started and avoid distraction. Finally, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. Everyone has too much to do and too little time. Nearly everyone feels the same level of stress as you do when faced with the monumental list of tasks to accomplish. You‚Äôre in good company.",25/07/2019,0,0,4,5,1050,1183,2,1,0,4,22

I‚Äôm currently ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äôd out‚Äù after watching videos from different writers and copywriters. From the eyes to the cerebral cortex to the fingers to the page.To you.These tips will be courtesy of professional copywriter Laura Belgray, who is the Owner of the copywriting business Talking Shrimp.She is also the co-creator of a writing course called Copy Cure, with entrepreneur Marie Forleo. Some of her writing credits include Bravo, Disney and HBO.Her writing style, I‚Äôd describe as witty and irreverent. Her email newsletters drop the F-Bomb every now and again with a humorous take on the world.For another example of her writing style, her website tagline is ‚ÄúCopywriting. Jumbo Style.‚Äù (A riff off of her business name Talking Shrimp.)These four tips stem from some of the YouTube videos I watched, two specifically: ‚ÄúHow to write a site that sells and compels‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Importance of Good Copywriting.‚ÄùLet‚Äôs get started now. Thanks.As told by Laura Belgray, paraphrased by me.Why? Because a person can relate a little more easily to language that mimics another person speaking to them, rather than a business ‚Äútalking‚Äù formally.And businesses, even if they are for-profit entities, are still made up of ‚Äî yes, you guessed it ‚Äî people.In the words of Belgray:‚ÄúSome people confuse professional with formal. Grammar doesn‚Äôt have to be formal for you to project a professional image.‚ÄùOne thing to note is that this tip will be relative to a type of business. Some industries are more formal than others, so might require another approach to blending the professional with the personable.Yet striking this balance is where the sweet spot lies for readability, according to Belgray.For example, thanks to the prevalence of ideas like the Law of Attraction, spirituality, abundance, and transformation are popular ideas of late. There‚Äôs lots in the ether about ‚Äúabundance,‚Äù Belgray notes.So let‚Äôs take a look at an example. Read on.First, let‚Äôs create a phrase more or less of the current zeitgeist: ‚ÄúStep into your greatness.‚ÄùNow, let‚Äôs decipher it.We get the general meaning , yes? But on a specific level, what does ‚Äústepping into one‚Äôs greatness‚Äù look like? Can we show rather than tell by creating a word picture? Yes, I think we can.How about this?‚ÄúYou did the research on Realsalaries.com. Listed your strengths, benchmarks and money-making achievements. With proof to guide you, today‚Äôs the day you look your boss in the eyes and ask him/her for a raise. Step into your greatness.‚ÄùOf course, this might need to be edited and shortened, but the sentences show rather than tell what ‚Äústepping into your greatness‚Äù looks like. Perhaps the words would be fitting for the site of a business coach.Belgray says that specificity makes for more powerful copywriting because then a person can envision themselves through your copy, and align themselves with you in the process.In the video ‚ÄúHow to write a site that sells and compels,‚Äù Belgray provides an example of a parenting website that claimed to ‚Äútransform timeouts.‚ÄùWhat exactly is transforming timeouts? She explains that this phrase doesn‚Äôt really get to the problem a parent would have, which is wanting their children to behave like other well-behaved kids, so they don‚Äôt have to, (gulp), raise their voice.So why not really address this issue directly?Belgray suggests the phrase:‚ÄúGet your kids to behave like an angel without yelling like an ogre.‚ÄùBelgray‚Äôs suggestion addresses a parent‚Äôs pain point directly of wanting a well-behaved child. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs what I need. How can I ‚Äúget‚Äù this?‚Äù is the next thought the parent of restless Renee might think.The imagery is also powerful because we can see in our minds an image of a parent raising their voice at their child to, sadly, get them to behave. And that there is a pending solution to this problem.The simile of angels to children and ogres to parents also takes this idea a step further to cement the image into our minds. ‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt be an ogre. Not a troll. Yes, let‚Äôs get them to be saintly and ethereal beings ‚Äî my child(ren).‚ÄùAlliteration aside, Belgray suggests bringing authenticity to copy that we write for ourselves, like on a website, for example. We might be witty or clever, but we don‚Äôt have to bring these qualities to the message at all times.Instead, we should focus on the end goal of communicating our message clearly, while weaving in personality in the process.An example of ‚Äúclarity over cleverness‚Äù would be to use simple titles for website headings such as About, Services, Resources, Contact, et al.The titles don‚Äôt have to be clever to draw someone in. Headings should communicate what a page is about clearly so a reader can navigate through your site quickly.If anything, a clever title like ‚ÄúThe Long and Winding Road‚Äù for an About Page can distract from the message, Belgray says.In closing, these tips are simple, but very important. I will be using them as I update my website. Will you? A quick recap:There are other things worth noting as well, such as SEO, a new topic for me. But for now, this is a start, noteworthy information from a respected writing professional. For the cost of five minutes of your time.I hope it was worth it ‚Äî thanks for reading.",25/07/2019,2,0,4,7,691,446,4,1,0,7,85
When the Title of My Book is Hiding,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/when-the-title-of-my-book-is-hiding-ea2b7347fa26,Madeline Dyer,948,4,945,"I have recently started writing a new manuscript, and at the moment, it is untitled.And I hate this.Really hate it.Seeing my Word document labeled as ‚ÄúUntitled Manuscript‚Äù makes me feel bad. It makes me feel wrong.Titles are important. Just as my characters have to have their own proper names right from the word go ‚Äî I can‚Äôt write well with placeholder names because I‚Äôm continually distracted by my knowledge that they aren‚Äôt the true names‚Äî I need to find a suitable title for a manuscript before I get far into it.I mean, if I haven‚Äôt got a suitable title, I can‚Äôt get far into it. It‚Äôs strange how my brain works, but I need a manuscript to have its own title, its own identity, for me to really feel connected.I need that connection.For me, a title makes a manuscript feel real. It‚Äôs not just me thinking to myself that I‚Äôll write a new story, but it signals that I‚Äôm actually doing it.A title makes me feel productive.But the right title makes me feel invincible in my writing.At the moment, I haven‚Äôt got a title.I am staring at the Word document. I‚Äôve got just under 5,000 words and I need to know the title now. I have to. My characters are begging me to, because they want to feel real, and I need them to real, and the title of their story will reveal a lot.A title sets the scene, the mood, the atmosphere. It invokes feelings and thoughts. It tells the reader something straight away.I need a title.But the right words just won‚Äôt come, and this is frustrating. It‚Äôs making me feel off. It‚Äôs a psychological stumbling block, because the more I think about how this manuscript has no title yet, the more I think that I can‚Äôt possibly write it well.Choosing a placeholder title seems like a good idea, until I realize that I‚Äôm only choosing it because I need to call it something, and that whatever I do call it isn‚Äôt going to be the real title.If I give a manuscript a placeholder name, it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not taking the story seriously. Like I‚Äôm not investing enough of my time and effort into it.A title is something that, for me, needs to grow organically from the manuscript.A title cannot be forced. It has to fit the story. Oftentimes, my title is a particular phrase or a couple of words I pull directly from the text I‚Äôve written that I just absolutely fall in love with.Sometimes, a title give a book a new meaning.Or a title has a double-meaning, and it‚Äôs not until you read the book‚Äôs end that you find the true meaning.But the title is nearly always one of the first things that a reader will see.A title is something that can draw a reader in or tell them to stay away.Readers judge titles, whether they mean to or not. I know I‚Äôve done it. I‚Äôve put books down in shops because I either don‚Äôt understand a title or it seems too ‚Äòboring‚Äô or unimaginative.From a writer‚Äôs point of view, this puts a lot of pressure on finding the right title, and I think this is why I feel so pressured to find the right title for my project as I‚Äôm writing it.Yet it‚Äôs strange just how caught up I get on finding the ‚Äúright‚Äù title as I write a manuscript, given that by the time my books are published, the title has nearly always changed. This isn‚Äôt unusual ‚Äî a lot of publishers request titles changes.So I don‚Äôt know why I get so latched onto the concept of finding the perfect title for a manuscript as I write it or why I feel I can‚Äôt write it well‚Äî or at all ‚Äî if I haven‚Äôt got the ‚Äúright‚Äù title.It doesn‚Äôt make sense. But, then again, when do our thoughts and feelings ever make sense?For me, finding the ‚Äúright‚Äù title is part of my writing process. It cannot be rushed, however much I want to do this, because it‚Äôs a way in which I connect on a deeper level with my characters, and I know that this process works for me.But it‚Äôs frustrating when I‚Äôm writing and I can‚Äôt find that perfect (or perfect-at-the-time) title as soon as I want to. It makes me think that whatever I‚Äôm writing won‚Äôt be that good, just because it‚Äôs untitled.But this is a lie ‚Äî titles, as you‚Äôre writing a book, aren‚Äôt that important. I mean, the fact publishers frequently change titles is proof of this. Yet, I can‚Äôt seem to listen to myself on this point, because my belief that I need to know the title (or at least the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô title for now) overrules this. It just does. I can‚Äôt help it.The thing is, I need to trust myself.Never once have I published a book and still been unsure of its title.I know that I will find a title I‚Äôm happy with, a title that fits, a title that works, and it cannot be rushed. Titling my draft is part of my writing process, and it needs to be done with care and not just for the sake of titling it.Madeline Dyer is a young adult novelist.

How To Be A Good Writer: Be Passionate And Feel Free,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/your-writing-should-be-flawed-cc117f8b2e88,Kyros Vogiatzoglou,795,4,868,"‚ÄúTo play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable!‚Äù‚Äï Ludwig van BeethovenHave you been trying to write the perfect Medium story or blog post?I suggest you stop trying. I did it for some time myself, and it made the whole writing process terribly long and complicated. I was trying to make every sentence perfect the first time round, spending an enormous amount of time fiddling with the details.I did it with music, too. In the beginning I thought I had to play every piece on the piano perfectly, every single time.But it doesn‚Äôt work that way at all. Either with music or writing.I recently wrote this story about starting my first fantasy novel. It was a spontaneous expression of my feelings one morning, when I woke up at 6 a.m. to write. I didn‚Äôt plan it very thoroughly and I didn‚Äôt think about its structure very much. I just quickly penned down my thoughts in a sincere and rather naive way.I say naive because sometimes, when I write drafts, I tend to think in terms of what I ‚Äúshould‚Äù write so people eventually get something out of a particular story.This time I did it in a totally different way. I opened up and wrote what I felt. One might think that‚Äôs dangerous in a way, because you put your defenses down and let people peek inside your head.But that‚Äôs what makes a story resonate with people at the end of the day.The story about my first novel was received quite well. It was actually as popular as other stories, which took me days to plan and research thoroughly.Being Greek, I‚Äôm lucky to be able to speak a very interesting and beautiful language.The Greek word œâœÅŒ±ŒØŒø (/…î.Ààr…õ.…î/), which translates as nice or beautiful, originates from the concept of serendipity, as it originally meant ‚Äútimely‚Äù. It comes from the word œéœÅŒ± ( /Ààora/), which means time.Something is beautiful when it happens in its proper time, like blooming plants or ripe fruit. Writing is beautiful if it happens the moment you‚Äôre inspired, when you feel like writing. We tell beautiful stories when we think less and feel more.That‚Äôs what Effie, my girlfriend at the time, said to me, a couple of days after I had a bicycle accident. We were in the car, and she asked me what‚Äôs the biggest lesson I think I learned from the accident. I love having these conversations with her, so I took my time to guess. I couldn‚Äôt.Her answer woke me up, though.Flashback two years earlier, when I started learning to play the piano. It‚Äôs my third or fourth lesson, and I‚Äôm sitting at my teacher‚Äôs piano, trying to get a tune to sound perfect. It drove her mad. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop every couple of notes and correct yourself, that‚Äôs not music‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúKeep playing, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you get a note wrong. Even the greatest composers make mistakes in live performances, but they keep playing anyway.‚ÄùExcuse me?At the time that comment didn‚Äôt make any sense whatsoever. You don‚Äôt have to get it perfect every time? How does that even work?But it does. Philip Glass is one of the greatest composers alive, and in this extraordinary performance of ‚ÄúMad Rush‚Äù he plays the wrong note. It‚Äôs just a slip of the finger, but you can hear it clearly at 7:07 if you listen.Being prepared to be flawed is part of who we are. My spontaneous story was received well, because it reflected my thoughts and feelings. People connected with it and accepted its imperfections. That story was me.Philip Glass makes mistakes and he‚Äôs undoubtedly a great composer and pianist. We love his music, because it‚Äôs a result of the composer expressing himself. We don‚Äôt mind the odd slip of the finger every now and then, because it‚Äôs irrelevant in the context of the performance. It doesn‚Äôt affect how we perceive his work.So, where does that leave you or me?You can‚Äôt control everything and you shouldn‚Äôt try to.It‚Äôs no use spending too long polishing your stories. Focusing too much on the details takes your attention away from the big picture, and you end up thinking out of context. You lose your unique perspective, which is what the rest of us are looking for in your stories.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you do need to review and edit a piece of writing and get the details right. But writing with your heart should be your priority. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to make it more relatable for your audience, and not the boring things, like your skills, your knowledge, or excessive, meticulous attention to detail.Before you write your next piece, take a moment to think.Why do you do what you do? Whatever that might be ‚Äî writing, painting, singing, anything.How do you express yourself through it?How does it make you feel?And then you may start writing, and tell people the things you need to tell them.Not for them. For yourself.I totally agree with our friend, Ludwig. Do what you do with passion, because not doing so is inexcusable.Let me introduce myself.My name is Kyros and my goal is to publish the fantasy novel I‚Äôm writing.Let‚Äôs connect and inspire each other to achieve our goals.",25/07/2019,3,0,1,10,1050,656,1,0,0,5,106
"If You Write for the Wrong Reasons, Is It Still OK?",The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/if-you-write-for-the-wrong-reasons-is-it-still-ok-baa15fc7b9e1,Caren Lissner,1300,7,1480,"There are many reasons that people write ‚Äî usually a mix of the unselfish and selfish. Considering writing is a fairly healthy activity (therapeutic with no side effects or aftertaste), there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. But why do I often question my own motivations for writing? And what should you do if you do the same?There‚Äôs a spectrum of reasons to write ‚Äî from the purely self-indulgent to the altruistic. Writing can simply be cathartic for the author, but it can also expose a problem in society that needs fixing. Sometimes, it does both.But is it okay if it doesn‚Äôt?Here‚Äôs a list of reasons people write:>To work out a problem or brainstorm ‚Äî usually via journal.>To preserve something beautiful, interesting, or unique.>To share something beautiful, interesting, or unique with others who‚Äôd otherwise never get a chance to experience it. This also helps the writer preserve the memory as well, at least in someone else‚Äôs mind.>To follow a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù to its logical conclusion, either for entertainment purposes or as a thought experiment.>To make others aware of a problem to solve.>To let others know they‚Äôre not alone.>To give others hope.>For wish fulfillment.The last reason is probably the worst reason to write, but it can still morph into an entertaining story.I‚Äôve always considered myself lucky to write and reach readers, and to occasionally be paid for it. When I scrawl in my journal, it‚Äôs often for therapy and brainstorming, or sometimes because I want to preserve memories and not lose them. These are selfish reasons, and as a result, I‚Äôd never want to anyone to read my poorly-written entries (I‚Äôm amazed that authors like Sylvia Plath have such well-written journals, because even when I start a new one trying to write well, it devolves into whining). I‚Äôve given myself a pass on making my journals readable, because it‚Äôs not going to happen. If anyone ever reads them looking for enlightenment, it‚Äôll be long after I‚Äôve shuffled off this mortal coil, and luckily I won‚Äôt be reachable for complaints.But how do I know if my writing is useful to readers, and that I‚Äôm not just doing it for my own health?How do I know if my writing is useful to readers?When I started writing, it was largely because I loved telling stories. I still wanted to interest others, take their mind off their problems, maybe explore some universal themes. Sometimes I want to connect with those who enjoy the same sort of stories I do.If I write purely for wish-fulfillment, it often doesn‚Äôt work. For years, I tried to write a teen novel about an innocent kid heading to travel camp. I rewrote it more than a dozen times. The problem was, as much as it was a fun premise, I was relying too much on my own experiences, reliving the halcyon days when I had a whole summer ahead and fantasized that anything could happen. Perhaps I was writing it more for wish-fulfillment than to understand the character. I never quite got the voice right. Someday I may be able to ‚Äúkill my darlings,‚Äù strip the story down to what it needs, then go from there. But I‚Äôm still glad I wrote it and learned from it.When I wrote other fiction, like my first published novel, it helped me explore issues I was facing in my late twenties. I had lived a relatively sheltered life in the suburbs before graduating from college. Heading into my twenties, I still held some black-and-white moral views and was starting to learn that they didn‚Äôt always apply to real life. I explored those themes in the novel through the eyes of a bright teenager who wasn‚Äôt socially aware. The themes of absolute truth and moral relativism were fun to look at, but the book served another purpose: I heard from other awkward types that it made them feel less alone. I enjoy finding a character or book I can relate to, and I‚Äôm glad if I‚Äôve helped others do that, even if a few.For the new novel I‚Äôm finishing up, I‚Äôm writing it because it‚Äôs the kind of book I want to read ‚Äî and can‚Äôt seem to find. It‚Äôs a book with many threads, a book I hope readers will want to spend a winter‚Äôs day with. We‚Äôll see if I succeed.Most writing, it seems, benefits both the author and the reader ‚Äî just in different ways. Even when it‚Äôs only written to entertain, it takes someone‚Äôs mind off their problems for a moment. Or allows them to see that someone else faced the same problems and survived.Most creative writing, then, is likely somewhere in the middle of the selfish/unselfish spectrum. On one end, you have the cathartic chickenscratch in our journals. But what‚Äôs at the other end?Service journalism would probably reside at that pole. When I was in journalism full-time (starting in the 1990s as a newspaper reporter at $17,000 per year), my colleagues and I often explored dismal topics that still had to be conveyed to readers in the most digestible form possible. These often weren‚Äôt ‚Äúsexy‚Äù stories and didn‚Äôt earn praise or awards. Even our more visible investigative pieces took a lot of gruntwork, but they helped a few people, or animals. My colleagues and I found out that the local animal shelter was violating its own rules by adopting out dogs without the proper paperwork. (We actually sent a reporter in to inquire about adopting two pit bulls, and the agency was all too eager to thrust them into his arms.) We wrote about councilpeople voting for raises for themselves at late-night meetings. We wrote about how to apply for health insurance and new government programs. If we hadn‚Äôt written these types of stories, no one would have known. We got hung up on, yelled at, chewed out, and forced to wait weeks for documents that should have been public. But people do benefit from service and investigative journalism, and I wouldn‚Äôt have felt satisfied if I let an important story bounce around in my head without it coming out.Luckily, all of my writing practice over the years, even the aforementioned chickenscratch in my journals, helped me learn how to write more economically, and thus helped me package stories about less exciting topics so that even readers with the shortest attention spans might get news they needed. (It helped me learn to write snappy headlines, too.) I sometimes wrote six stories a week at the newspaper, and while not all of them were essential, I know they helped.Even the chickenscratch in my journal helped me eventually write news that readers needed.I guess my point is that most writing lies somewhere on the selfish/unselfish spectrum, but a writer shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty for where it falls. Sometimes it educates and informs, and sometimes it just makes someone laugh. Sometimes it‚Äôs actually the fiction that informs and the nonfiction that inspires a smile.I wouldn‚Äôt say all types of writing are equally hard, though. Recently, the New Yorker published an essay, ‚ÄúWhy Does Writing Suck?‚Äù I cringed at that one. You‚Äôll see writers complaining on the internet a lot ‚Äî it‚Äôs not because they have a worse job than anyone; it‚Äôs because, well, writers are on the internet a lot, writing. Sometimes I find writerly complaints a bit too self-indulgent. I make jokes on Twitter about hating revisions, but I‚Äôd much rather write than do window-washing, construction, or phlebotomy. I‚Äôd rather write than go back to my $4.25-an-hour job in fast food, or the summer data entry slot where I punched numbers into a computer all day, or the job I had where I had to change my boss‚Äôs maxi pad (a story for another day, but it just made me grateful that I didn‚Äôt need someone else to do that for me).Sometimes I find writers‚Äô complaints a bit too self-indulgent.I suppose every job has its selfish and unselfish aspects ‚Äî and the hardest jobs hopefully at least pay well to make up for the grind.Maybe I need to get over the guilt that I‚Äôm finally in a place to make bit of money off my writing, and just be thankful that I sometimes get to do what I love. And keep trying to find ways to make it as useful to others as I can.You may have noticed that out of all my posts in this ongoing series ‚Äî Out of the Reject Pile ‚Äî this is the most journal-like, the most rambling. The others are more practical, about getting published and rejection. Should I have included this one in the series, or kept it to myself? I‚Äôm not sure. Perhaps it will give insight to people who feel a bit guilty about their writing too. If that‚Äôs you, share your feelings below. And meanwhile I‚Äôll be back next week with something more fun ‚Äî or maybe a little selfish and a little therapeutic.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,2,640,480,1,0,0,7,183
Seven Falsehoods the Republican Party Has Been Spreading for Decades,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/seven-falsehoods-the-republican-party-has-been-spreading-for-decades-ddf563f215c9,John Coble,280,15,3242,"These Republican lies predate Donald Trump. These lies laid the foundation for ‚ÄòTrump-ism.‚ÄôDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the author, and do not necessarily reflect the position of DDI. We advise you to conduct your own independent research through multiple sourcesIf this story were about lies Trump tells, it would be several times the length of the Mueller Report and no one would have time to read it. This story is about the mythology the Republicans have created surrounding themselves and the Democrats. The Republicans have been building this mythology for decades now. These myths are the essence of the Republican brand. The problem is, this image propagated by the Republican Party is not in alignment with reality. A mixture of a little common sense and a little data will prove the falseness of these Republican assertions.www.datadriveninvestor.comThe truth is that nine of the eleven recessions since 1947 began under Republican administrations. See the chart below:The gray areas on the graph are the recessions. The first Democratic recession was under President Truman in 1949 and the last was under President Carter in 1980. President Carter‚Äôs recession was the shortest of all the recessions since 1947.In 1960, President Kennedy brought us out of a Republican recession after his first quarter in office. In 2009, President Obama needed two quarters to lift our nation out of the Great Recession that started during the administration of President George W. Bush.In 1953, President Eisenhower took us into a recession within two quarters of taking office. In 1981, President Reagan took us into recession after two quarters in office. In 2001, George W. Bush took us into recession after one quarter in office.I do not approve of either party‚Äôs handling of criminal justice or the prison system. I am very confident that a comprehensive policy to fight crime would fare much better than the ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô legislation used by both parties over the past several decades. That being said, the graph below makes it clear that the Democrats have been much more successful in fighting crime than the Republicans.The data for the above graphic can be found at this link from the FBI for the years 1968 through 2014, at this link for the year 2015, at this link for the year 2016, and at this link for the year 2017. The data for the population for the years 2015‚Äì2017 is available at the Census Bureau at this link. These statistics are the total violent crimes divided by the nation‚Äôs population for particular years..This graph is colored blue during periods of Democratic administrations and red during periods of Republican administrations. Clearly, there is a correlation between violent crime rising under Republican administrations and falling under Democratic administrations. The data does not support the conclusion that the Democrats are ‚Äòsoft on crime.‚Äô If anything, the data would most likely indicate that the Republicans are soft on crime.Today‚Äôs Republican Party is in no way the Party of Lincoln. Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States. The current President is the 45th President of the United States. By analogy to families, there are 29 generations between Lincoln and the present day. As would be expected from the dilution of a family over 29 generations, there is no resemblance between today‚Äôs Republican Party and Lincoln‚Äôs Republican Party. Lincoln‚Äôs Party went to war to protect the rights of the most vulnerable among us in the 1860s; the African-American slave. Today‚Äôs Republican Party puts foreigners seeking refuge into cages. Today‚Äôs Republican Party is the exact opposite of the Party of Lincoln.In the early 1960s, the Democratic Party became the Party of Lincoln when it pushed for civil rights and voting rights for all. The Democratic Party didn‚Äôt have to work for the rights of minorities. The Democrats had been the dominant party for decades at that time. The Democratic Party lost many supporters in the South when it pushed for voting rights and civil rights. The Republicans were happy to pick up these new members.I first heard this falsehood in the mid-2000s on a morning radio show. It was not a political show. It was a couple of guys who reveled in being Southern rednecks and billed themselves as the sexiest fat men alive. The show was supposed to be a comedy, but over time, it gradually became more political in nature. Like most white Southerners, the radio hosts had an extreme right-wing ideology. When I first heard this, I thought to myself that this follows something I had long ago noticed about people. The first one to accuse someone else of a misdeed is usually the one who committed the misdeed in the first place. I didn‚Äôt know the term at the time, but we now know this strategy as deflecting and projecting.This Republican talking point is an obvious case of the Republicans projecting themselves on to the Democrats. The creators of these talking points know this, but they hope that because they said it first, it will stick in the minds of their uninformed voters.Mitt Romney was caught making a similar argument in a private meeting during the 2012 Presidential campaign. Romney said that the Democrats were giving gifts to 47% of the voters. See this video from YouTube. Romney‚Äôs statements are not grounded in reality, but does that really matter anymore? I think this makes it clear which party wants just 51% of the vote.In 1976, Jude Wanniski wrote an article titled ‚ÄòTaxes and the Two-Santa Theory.‚Äô Wanniski proposed that Republicans counter the Democrat‚Äôs entitlement programs with their own ‚Äògive-away‚Äô program. The Republican ‚Äògive-away‚Äô would be tax cuts. These tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans. These tax cuts have led to the greatest redistribution of wealth in American history. This redistribution transferred wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthiest Americans. In order to remain in power, these tax cuts had to benefit just enough of the voters to hold a majority. See the graphic below for how well this ‚ÄòTwo-Santa‚Äô strategy has worked for the average American worker since the late 1970s:The above graph is from the article, Top 1.0 Reaches Highest Wages Ever ‚Äî Up 157 Percent Since 1979 from the Economic Policy Institute‚Äôs Working Economics Blog at this link.The Democrat‚Äôs entitlement programs benefit all Americans, i.e., Medicare and Social Security. The Republican‚Äôs tax cuts need to benefit 51% in order to keep the Republicans in office. Hence, it is the Republicans who only want to get 51% of the vote. If the Republicans get 55% of the vote, that means they reached too far into the middle class with their tax cut Santa Claus 4% more than necessary. Therefore, the Republicans would see this as over-paying for their victory.The myth that Democrats are only trying to get 51% of the vote is an example of the Republicans falsely projecting their own scheme on to the Democrats.The graph below seems to say it all; the Republican Party is the big-spending party and the Democrats are the budget-conscious party.The data for the graphic above was taken from FRED at this link.The red part of the line is the periods when Republicans hold the Presidency. The blue part of the line is the periods when Democrats hold the Presidency. Clearly, the period of the greatest deficits are those times when a Republican is President. The single exception to this general rule is President Obama‚Äôs first term. The excessive Obama deficits were the result of the Obama administration having to pay the bills run up by the George W. Bush administration. President Bush decided that it made perfect sense to have two tax cuts and fight two wars simultaneously. This financial irresponsibility on the part of the Republicans set the conditions for the Great Recession. Right out of the gate, President Obama had to pay for a $700 billion bank bailout, bailout of the auto industry, and use another $800 billion to stimulate the economy.The Trump administration inherited a thriving economy. So how does the Trump administration justify its need to run trillion-dollar deficits? The answer involves the evolution that the ‚ÄòTwo Santa Claus Theory‚Äô has taken over the years. See this article from Salon.com. It perfectly explains the modern ‚ÄòTwo Santa Theory‚Äô:First, when Republicans control the federal government, and particularly the White House, spend money like a drunken sailor and run up the US debt as far and as fast as possible. This produces three results ‚Äî it stimulates the economy thus making people think that the GOP can produce a good economy, it raises the debt dramatically, and it makes people think that Republicans are the ‚Äútax-cut Santa Claus.‚ÄùSecond, when a Democrat is in the White House, scream about the national debt as loudly and frantically as possible, freaking out about how ‚Äúour children will have to pay for it!‚Äù and ‚Äúwe have to cut spending to solve the crisis!‚Äù This will force the Democrats in power to cut their own social safety net programs, thus shooting their welfare-of-the-American-people Santa Claus.Any casual observer of the evening news would know that this quote about the ‚ÄòTwo Santa Theory‚Äô is the exact strategy the Republicans have been using for the past few decades.Of course, this is not true. The few Democrats that use the word ‚Äòsocialism‚Äô use the term in the context of ‚Äòsocial democracy.‚Äô There is a huge difference. Socialism is defined by Merriam-Webster as1: any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods2a: a system of society or group living in which there is no private propertyb: a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state3: a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work doneThis definition of Socialism applies to only a few countries in the world today. North Korea is the only example I can think of. The openly Communist countries such as China have a degree of capitalism, e.g., Alibaba.com.Some democrats advocate for Social Democracy. Merriam-Webster defines Social Democracy as follows:1: a political movement advocating a gradual and peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism by democratic means2: a democratic welfare state that incorporates both capitalist and socialist practicesThe Democrats that call themselves ‚ÄòSocial Democrats‚Äô fall within the definition of item 2 above. The United States has been a ‚ÄòSocial Democracy‚Äô for centuries now. Our government has always owned some businesses that compete against private businesses, i.e., public education versus private education. Those who call themselves Social Democrats are primarily advocating for socialized medicine and reduced higher education costs. America already has socialized medicine through the VA, Obamacare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These dangerous ‚ÄòSocialists‚Äô just want to expand our socialized health systems so that we have universal coverage. All of the other democratic advanced economies have universal healthcare coverage.Another example of these dangerous ‚ÄòSocialist‚Äô is the Tennessee Republicans that have provided free tuition community college since 2014. See this article from Politico for more on the Tennessee free community college tuition plan.My favorite example of the Republican hypocrisy regarding socialism is a dangerous ‚ÄòSocialist‚Äô known as Mo Brooks. Mo Brooks is a little known Congressman from Huntsville, AL. This is the same ‚ÄòMo Brooks‚Äô that voted against the renewal of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund renewal. See this article from ‚ÄòHomeland Security Today‚Äô for the list of Congressmen who voted against the funding of the ‚Äò9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.‚Äô When our so-called ‚ÄòSocialist President Obama‚Äô wanted to sell the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government-owned power company, Mo Brooks objected. See this article from AL.com for more on Mo Brooks defense of TVA. Doesn‚Äôt this make Mo Brooks the Socialist and President Obama the Capitalist?Republicans want to brand the Democrats as evil Soviet-style Socialists/Communists in attempt to portray the Democrats as being ‚Äòagainst the American way.‚Äô Yet, as seen in item 5 above, the Republicans are more than happy to spend money on tax cuts that redistribute money to the wealthiest Americans. Is it the ‚ÄòAmerican way‚Äô to take from the poor and give to the rich?Socialism has just become a word that Republicans use to try to demonize the Democrats. The Democrats need to call out these Republican socialist ventures. The Democrats need to force the Republicans to explain themselves when they call Democrats ‚ÄòSocialists.‚Äô Many of the voters will probably decide that ‚ÄòSocialism‚Äô doesn‚Äôt sound so bad.The greatest enemy of the Republican Party is not the Democratic Party. The greatest enemy of the Republican Party is socialized medicine. The Republicans will stop at nothing to spread the falsehood that ‚Äògovernment healthcare‚Äô will turn our healthcare system into a horrible mess. The truth is, our healthcare system is a horrible mess. The table below compares our healthcare system to the other group of seven (G7) countries. The G7 countries are the seven nations that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes as the largest advanced economies in the world. The table below shows that Americans pay significantly more for significantly less healthcare. We Americans also pay for our healthcare system with approximately two fewer years of life expectancy than the other G7 countries.The data for columns 1‚Äì3 in the table above can be found at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) database at this link. The OECD is an organization of 36 member countries, including the United States. Choose ‚Äòsocial protection‚Äô on the left side for the queries to find the information in the table above. Column 4 is from the World Health Organization (WHO) at this link. Column 5 is from the OECD and can be found at this link. The column 6 data is from the WHO and can be found at this link.This is the simplest accurate table that I could create. Different countries have very different healthcare systems. Primarily, the systems can be grouped into Universal Healthcare by Mandate, Universal Healthcare by a Single-Payer System, Universal Healthcare by a Two-Tiered System, as well as ‚Äúother.‚Äù These numbers are from 2016. At that time, America had Universal Healthcare by Mandate; that is not the case today. In 2013, the year before Obamacare came into effect, the USA had total health insurance coverage of 85.5% of the population. By 2016, that coverage had risen to 91.2% of the population. The latest data show that American coverage has dropped to 90.6% of the population. This may sound like a small drop, but in a nation of approximately 330,000,000, this comes to approximately 2,000,000 people. It is worth noting that the Republican Party has been attacking the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) over the past two years. See this story from NPR regarding these attacks. The government provided healthcare in America is in the form of the VA (Veterans Administration), Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare subsidies.The table above shows that many countries that you may have thought were single-payer countries are actually two-tier countries, e.g. Canada. In a two-tier system, a person can buy private insurance that is either supplementary or complementary to government coverage. This is why a country can have 100% government coverage and 67% private coverage. Some of the countries above provide government insurance only when the individual has no other insurance.Currently, the primary argument the Republican Party has made against socialized medicine is that patients in countries with socialized medicine have to endure long wait-times for their healthcare. See this article on the Republican propaganda campaign regarding excessive wait times for healthcare in countries with socialized medicine. As with any good lie, there is some truth involved here. However, I have recently been researching the issue of wait-times in other countries and within different parts of our own country. The issue of wait-times is beyond the scope of this story but will be a primary topic in my next story. Wait-times vary greatly among different countries. America is not necessarily the best country in the world when it comes to wait-times.When all of the data is considered, it is clear that our peers within the G7 are doing a much better job of providing healthcare for their citizens than America.The Republican Party spreads a great deal of false information. The Democratic Party is not a perfect example of honesty, but in comparison to the Republican Party, the Democratic Party looks like Honest Abe Lincoln as idealized by history. The false information spread by the Republican Party is necessary since their policies are designed to primarily benefit the top 15‚Äì20% of the population. The Republican Party must confuse a large portion of the population into voting against their own interest.In recent years, the bulk of the Republican Party has moved toward a coalition of the xenophobic, racists, protectionists, uneducated (see this article on the website for the Thought Company), a religious cult (see my story at this link), and the small percentage that actually benefit from Republican policies. In order to maintain this coalition, the Republicans must misinform the majority of their voters. The Republicans use ‚Äòsound-bites‚Äô like ‚Äòthe Democrats are Socialists‚Äô (see this video on YouTube), the Democrats are ‚Äòsoft on crime‚Äô (see this video on YouTube), the Democrats are the ‚Äòparty of big spenders‚Äô, and the Democrats will crash the economy if they win elections (See this video on YouTube). These are just a few of the lies told by the Republican Party in an effort to sow sufficient fear and confusion for just enough people to vote against their interests by voting for Republicans.This story disproves all of these sound-bites. In the interests of keeping the story as short as possible, I did not address all examples of Republican mythology.www.cbsnews.comLast Sunday, July 21, 2019, Liz Cheney appeared on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄòFace the Nation.‚Äô See the video above. Ms. Cheney was the face of the Republican propaganda machine on that day. She repeatedly demanded ‚Äòto look at the substance of the issues.‚Äô This is another example of deflection and projection. Ms. Cheney wanted to convince those within the Republican voting coalition that those voters are the ones that are ‚Äòthinking‚Äô and the Democrats are the ones reacting to ‚Äòsound-bites‚Äô or ‚Äòdog-whistles.‚Äô In reality, Ms. Cheney was projecting what she was doing and what her voters were believing on to the Democrats. Ms. Cheney‚Äôs statements held no substance. Ms. Cheney deflected from a question on racism and projected ‚Äòsocialism,‚Äô etc on to the Democrats. She had no intention of giving substantive answers to the questions asked.This story provides substance in the form of real data. The Republican Party is unable to rebut the data presented in this story. Hopefully, the Republican voters will stop succumbing to the same old lies and give deep consideration to the issues. If this miracle of ‚Äòcritical reasoning‚Äô occurs, the 2020 elections will go very well for the Democrats.Only a huge political defeat will cause the Republican Party to change its ways. A responsible and honest Republican Party would and give the American voter a legitimate alternative to the Democratic Party. There is a place for conservatism within our two-party system. Currently, the Republican Party does not represent conservatism but instead represents right-wing extremism. The Republican Party needs to refresh itself with new leadership. The Republican Party needs to adopt more moderate positions. If the Republican Party would make these changes, then an independent such as myself could once again consider voting for a Republican.",25/07/2019,6,0,6,1,820,553,7,0,0,37,339
//ERROR// I‚Äôm the Ma1n cHaRaCt3R,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/error-im-the-ma1n-charact3r-b6694a3c5c31,J. L. Lambert II,37,6,979,"There are four rules when writing you Character into your story that you should understand. There are also certain moments when you pick up a hammer and start demolishing the rules like a beast from the video game RAMPAGE.Now before we dive into the rules, let me just tell you that everything written here is based on The Coffee Break Screenwriter: Break the Rules by Pilar Alessandra. I recommend reading that for more information.Let‚Äôs get into it.This rule has been broken many times throughout the years. A good example would be A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess and tv shows such as It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia.Having a likable Main Character (MC) can really get people on board but can be worn out pretty quickly.This rule exists to let the audience experience the story in the eyes of the MC. It also makes us feel like there will be a redemption arc somewhere down the line.Personally, I think flawed and unlikeable characters, in the beginning, are more enjoyable to read and watch than a character that is likeable right of the bat. By doing this, it puts a lot of power to the redemption arc because we want to this see this character grow and change for the better.Alessandra puts down a couple of reasons such as:Now just because we have a reason to break doesn‚Äôt mean we just go to town on the works. There must be a balance. If your character is the biggest jerk in the story but has no way of redeeming themselves it can leave a bad taste in the audience‚Äôs mouth when the story ends. [This matters most to the MC than other characters.]Giving a reason to why your MC is the worst can be an excellent way to get people on the MC‚Äôs side. There are consequences to their action; they are not free from the slander and hate.The reasons for this rule is to keep your characters from feeling one-dimensional. Which is true it gives your character more depth when they have room to grow. It deepens the story and gives us an emotional journey than a journey where the MC kills everything in his path and succeeds.Actions movies and comedies. They are funny and action pack, maintain that edge and humour throughout the whole story. People just love seeing other people beat the crap out of each other.Another reason to break it is to tell a traditional hero story. They are brave in the beginning and brave at the end, and they are fearless in the middle. Think of James Bond [not the Daniel Craig Bond], or recently Captain Marvel. This can build up the ‚Äúfranchise potential.‚ÄùTv characters is also another reason to break the rule so that the audience keeps tunning in every week to see this character change as little as possible.An excellent way to break the rule is to have the world around them change and keep them static, it will feel like they are outplaced and should change.This is one rule I think you should really think about before you break it. Having a character stay the same can make the audience feel like they are watching or reading a story and aren‚Äôt really invested. Comedies are the outlier.No, they don‚Äôt. Stop thinking that.This rule is here to help the audience understand the character and get on their side. It helps give a reason to why they are doing all of this.I agree that backstories are needed, but you don‚Äôt need to reveal them verbally. You can slowly show them with flashbacks or in small increments throughout the story.It‚Äôs a crutch for the character to explain their flaw. We in the real world, don‚Äôt disclose our flaws to people, especially if it is a profound reason why we act this way.Action speaks louder than words.A perfect reason is that it can slow down the pace of your story. We don‚Äôt want to be reading or watching an intense story and halfway through have everything slow to a stop just so the MC can explain why he/she is a jerk.An excellent way to break the rule is to have your character react to the world around them. From there we can piece together why they hate this or like that. The MC is not going to have a good relationship with everyone, have that be an aspect of the story.One way that I see a lot is how they live. Usually, it‚Äôs in the beginning, it shows us how they are surviving in this world. You can tell a lot about someone from the way they live.This rule is more for screenwriting than prose but can be used in both instances.The reason for this rule is to help us see the character then read the character. It also allows people from all over to imagine who they want in that character.When you are really specific in describing the character, it leaves nothing for the mind to imagine, to visualize what it wants to see. Don‚Äôt kill my creativity.For your female characters, it keeps you from always having to describe them in terms of their body type and features.Talk about their skills and personality, it tells us way more than just how they look. For example, instead of saying, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a well-built man,‚Äù say something on the lines of ‚ÄúHe comes out stoic, clean, physically gifted.‚Äù This gives the audience just a little more to chew on.When your story is feeling a little bland feel free to take some of these rules and break them. It can help boost your story in specific ways.Just a little reminder that everything I have written can be found in The Coffee Break Screenwriter: Break the Rules by Pilar Alessandra in more detail. It‚Äôs a good read if you want to know more about the rules.That‚Äôs it from me, thanks for reading.",26/07/2019,0,0,0,5,1050,1006,6,1,0,12,45
"Like a Basket, we Weave our Story",The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/like-a-basket-we-weave-our-story-f21e0e6f7b11,J. L. Lambert II,37,4,655,"Story writing is a craft that takes time and practice. Only by writing and reading do we get better. So open those eyes of yours and take a gander at what I‚Äôm putting down.When we are planning out our story, we usually write down each plot point. Just as in writing the first order of things might not be the best thing.Scene Weave is also known as scene breakdown, outline, and list. It is the step by step of how everything in our story goes down. This a perfect God‚Äôs eye view of your story where you can see if everything falls into place and leads up to that tasty ending.When ordering the list, you will be putting down in one single line the action of the scene. The purpose that the scene is in your story, but you won‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs the real purpose until you start writing out the scene. That is when you will be fully immersed inside, and your characters will do things freely.Be willing to change up the order here and there, nothing is set in stone, and your first write up of the order might not be the best. Be flexible and don‚Äôt worry about cutting. Sometimes we have to kill our babies. [Not all the time, though.]Remember to order them by structure not by chronology.Okay, okay, you know that moment in your head when that perfect line just sticks. The line is just possessing you, and you really want to put this line in your story because you know it‚Äôs cool. Well, don‚Äôt just write a whole scene just to put in that line.If you did do this, don‚Äôt worry, just combine that scene with another scene to give that line a purpose and not just there because you think it looks cool. I have heard some many friends say ‚ÄúHey wouldn‚Äôt it be cool‚Ä¶‚Äù and I immediately look at them and say, ‚ÄúWill that help the story?‚ÄùUsually, the cool things don‚Äôt work with the story because we are there in the moment and don‚Äôt see the bigger picture. Take time to really digest that cool idea and figure out an excellent way to incorporate it in the story without distracting the audience.Sometimes in life, when you got this wicked story baby, but it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and turns into a weed that starts destroying your baby garden. That is when you pull out the shears and cut it.Cutting some stuff can be hard, all that time you put in it is gone and will never come back. It‚Äôs all right because nine out of ten times it‚Äôs for the good of the story. [Thinking about it now a cancer analogy for cutting things would‚Äôve been good, oh well.]The same goes for adding. There will be moments when things seem lacking, and you need to put a scene in. Just remember to make sure it fits, and go through the reordering just to make sure everything looks perfect. You spent a lot of time working on this.Juxtaposing some scene can bring the story to life. This is more important in screenplays but can be very helpful when writing scenes for your novel. You don‚Äôt have to do it for all your scenes, but the power of two juxtaposed scene can really bring out a point you are trying to make.[Real short and sweet, doesn‚Äôt even take to much of your time to read.]To recap a Scene Weave is a list of all of your scenes in your story. Sometimes you have to Reorder that list, Combine scenes together, Cut or Add scenes to help tell your story more clearly. If you want to get nasty with it, [I mean that in a good way], Juxtaposing a scene here and there can liven up the story.You read more about this in John Truby‚Äôs book, The Anatomy of Story.That‚Äôs all from me, thanks for reading.",25/07/2019,1,0,4,1,,,5,0,0,10,17
The Concept of Collaboration and Consolidation,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-concept-of-collaboration-and-consolidation-exploiting-our-differences-to-unify-on-a-common-45922b9ecc46,Dr. ADAM TABRIZ,813,9,2137,"Profiling is one of the innumerable inherent attributes of human nature. It is as much of an unconsciously driven behavior as is voluntary speculation. It is merely aspired to simplify tasks and frequently make them efficient, but it conveys its particular drawbacks. Henceforth, I aim to commune the pragmatic, as yet controversial use of the schema of portraying related to profiling within the limited context of unity and collaboration.One of the essential unconscious tools of the immediate human psyche is the notion of unity or consolidation with a shared belief or cause, which sounds ordinary and empowering. However, regrettably, what goes promising in its literal footing may not be the same at the practical materialization. To cultivate, we postulate to acquaint ourselves with a few crucial denominations that play a central role in enacting profiling and integration.www.datadriveninvestor.comThe notion of Difference and SimilarityPolarity is the single generic and most of the import denominator of all problems in the history of humanity, as it is the catalyst of misfit, conflict, and power struggle. It is plainly defined by the product of personal character, element, or factor that distinguishes contrasting situations and the state of being indistinguishable, similitude, or resemblance in every facet of a person's life. However, the polarity of human attributes is not the root of problems, but it can and serves as a catalyst to most of the solutions for daily problems. Nevertheless, carrying the like trait is a minor contributor to problems as our differences dos.So ‚Äî why encourage Unity and consolidation?As we name it, the state of more than one person in an individual unit, the unity or the form of consolidation, is a modern-day platitude. The thought of establishing a common ground where most of us bear and dissent is appealing.Considering its members' number, credibility, and quality, consolidated efforts convey significant weight, but they must pursue a fixed delegation approved and coordinated by the leadership. Creating a United figurehead is comparatively an old phenomenon, but with variation, it is subject to the indefinite denominators and factors. To unify people, one must clearly define the similarities among its members and wield those traits to delineate the commission. For instance, if five multitudes conceive that saving X will improve Y by implementing z, they have a common ground to work as a single unit. Still, if one of the members thought there might be an alternate option, ""A,"" then the majority decisiveness will potentially override the latter option unless there is enough power of logical thinking behind selection A that is weighty enough to persuade the team.What about collaboration?Collaboration is the state of two or more people working jointly to accomplish the same objective. In contrast to being cooperative, each partner freely contributes to the process by practically following their visions and missions with small or no collective authority over others. For instance, there is a demand to improve Y, and three people furnish A, Z, and X services, respectively. Indeed, we can appreciate collaborative efforts; it is unneeded to hold every contributor to the same criterion to attain the obstinate outcome.Difference between the consolidation and collaborationConsolidation is convenient and rewarding, especially for those with lesser self-reliance. It is easily manipulated, stringently defined, and invites authoritarianism, thus centralized control. Collaboration multifariously is a decentralized undertaking, marginal bureaucracy, and requires self-confidence from its comrades. Therefore, it is the procedure of independent reasoning with convergence inclination on to the agreed objective differences.Objective and subjective differences of the individual members of both types of processes are the Influencers of the outcome but suppressed in a consolidated effort and liberated in collaborative contribution. Regarding the law of similarity, solely the selected are enforced by the profile the constituents share within a consolidation. Indeed, Unification is an absolute prerequisite to populism and its discriminatory observance. On the contrary, since everyone is expected to be of diverse background, being alike is not a prerequisite for collaborative efforts; even so, being different and harnessing the power of diversity is one of the most robust features of joining, nevertheless independent contribution.Unifying factors: is it as good as it sounds?It sounds overwhelmingly powerful and securing to combine. For centuries, the catchword of Unity has been used in political magniloquence by creating a towering monstrosity and banding in concert the multitude against it. Nonetheless, to make it work out and enhance its outcome applicable to a large scale, leaders have also made liberal usage of brainwashing techniques.Uniting people based on a set of the same identifiers or beliefs resemble a slippery slope, with the ultimate destination- fascism, discrimination, and totalitarianism. I refer to it as ""profiled liberty at the moderate scale of the spectrum."" The consolidation chooses shared mission over individual liberty.The conception of profilingThe process of extrapolating information about a person with known traits or tendencies, precisely the act of targeting a person with observed characteristics or conduct or racial determinants, is universal to every person. We unconsciously make the inclination to observe our common traits with others and, simultaneously, recognize the differentiating factors between us all. Nevertheless, the majority among us are consciously able to forbid the prejudiced outcome of acting against incorporating those factors through learned ethical motives and norms.Populism and consolidationThe political usefulness of unity is a sample of an overture that strives to appeal to the masses of ordinary people with common interests who feel an established group of elites disregards their concerns. Populist ideology thrives on the concept of uniting the front groundwork on the wishes of the popular group. Not infrequently fails by omitting the primary rationale for solving the original problem. Populist delegation is directed en route-target area established by a few at the top of the political ladder. Backing for redistribution of wealth as a way of funding quality of life for the average or low income is one such example, despite appreciating redistribution of wealth is a short-term solution, if at all, and would eventually slow down the economy and limit opportunity; likewise, a coalition of the people to volunteer for a war across the world with no apparent objective.Buzzwords of unity, power, success, equalityA few of the most attractive words are united, power, success, and equality. These fury words have occupied the center stage in today's public media. If you ever wonder why it is sn, the shutter's answer is plausible- because few use the notion ""words are cheap."" As appealing as they can be, the Buzzwords of consolidation are not always liberators of the person by harnessing collective actions, but the expression of exploiting joint agenda by liberating action of one group with one standard plan.""Bird of a feather fly together"" is a typical exemplar of how unification works but is there such a concept?Of course, it would only be true if we ignored a bird's other attributes; if two white doves are most compatible, then if their progeny is born with a black spot, their unity must be considered obsolete!. However, it is a robust tool, more so, convenient because the unconscious human mind seems to work in the same way it does for the dove.What is the drawback of unity and consolidation?Forming a united front is an exceedingly powerful instrument. It serves the mission well as long as the path to reach the point of resolution is set ahead of time and the road to achieving their laid legato. For the most part, it requires its individual member's commitment to put aside their prerogatives and unconditionally accept the rules of engagement set by the front leader. The consolidation strategy is inflexible unless revisited by the leaders of the particular forum. With the virtue of its rigid nature, a union, although maybe created democratically, by no means functions that way, as the referendum process within its framework is usually destined to be bureaucratic or even corrupt, more so if the organization grows over a specific size. Consolidation also resembles a big target. For its singularity and size, it is a practical and convenient target for the competitors unless the commune of the organization grows fast and gains enough momentum to maintain competitiveness. Hence, Commonwealth is nothing less than a sizeable easy target even at times may be shielded by its size.What makes collaboration hard?Collaboration is the way to use every talent that a person brings to the table of limitless capability without jeopardizing the interests of the other players. It is efficient, productive, yet even more potent than oneness. Nevertheless, to succeed requires individual commitment, respect, and transparency to the missions and others.In collaborative teamwork, transparency is a must, and accountability is the virtue. The self-discipline of the collaborators may sound straightforward; however, it is an undertaking hardly achieved by everyone. Some may start with the intention of a collaborative effort to work, but they eventually swivel by falling back on consolidated mechanisms.""Why empower a group of people collectively when we can empower every individual. Consolidation is another single but a bigger target"" Adam Tabriz, MD.Collaboration is a self-oriented mission towards a common goal, whereas consolidation is task-oriented, theoretically serving the same purpose. They are two phenomena with presumable objectives influenced by entirely different subjective criteria. What separates the two through the process may be hairsplitting thin at the start, but the outcomes at the ending are potentially divergent. Under the same principle, the smaller consolidated group will potentially rescue a comparable result to the one delivered through collaboration. Still, it may be more vulnerable as it reaches viability in line with the objectives of its competitors.Fascism vs. realismAs mentioned in the beginning unifying factors of consolidation are the common trait between its constituents. Such a scheme has little or no regard for the individual talent, skill, or passion, primarily if they don't correspond to the preordained course of action decided within the organization's leadership. Regarding consolidation, it is merely the popular or authoritative sentiment that makes it autocratic. So if we are to swap fascism for realism, we can let loose the individual talent and productiveness. Bringing out the actual values of the individual contributors' system will exponentially empower and hold efficiency.Consolidation is one big, well-defined target, as it thrives on a single vision and mission of its leaders. It is easier to be undermined- ultimately, for alliance's sake, size does matter but also invites corruptness and deviation. Even so, collaborations are guided towards a common goal, but their missions and Visions may differ completely, rendering them less vulnerable to the numerosity of the target. In other words, its decentralized structure is indeed its inherent strength.Power of individualIndividual deliverables funneled through an independent channel convey more power than funneling selected deliverables from each member within the group set through profiling.So why take the course of unity over collaboration?Because it is:Convenient- it is merely easier to form the team and keep it intact.Less costly- Profiling is an efficient instrument to reduce costs at the expense of minority interests and traits that do not fall within the immediate class of appeals of that particular delegacy.Easily manipulated- for those familiar with the organizational structure of societies, unions and boards would accord that it has always been a universal vogue for unification to work perfectly at the outset and fall apart by corruption and bureaucracy as they grow. This course represents the vulnerability of those systems to the authoritative pivotal manipulation by the hands of a few with alternate interests.The target of Biased Leadership ‚Äî thus, the Leadership role is significant because it is much easier to deviate from the standard norms.Discriminatory- consolidation is not liberating to its independent individual members. It solely rewards those willing to bear the common cause while giving away other rights.Rhetorically susceptible- Swayed by the power of targeted marketing and entitlement for pre-glamorized traits, the common conscious interests easily divert consolidations.Profiling is the most robust tool for breaking a competition because it weakens them by dismantling unique individual traits.Prerequisite to corporatism and bureaucracy-too survive and succeed, consolidation needs to gain as many supporters as possible in an as short time as possible, giving the corporatism a way to go.The positivity of being differentThus, the fundamental driving factor of collaborative over consolidated efforts solely originated from emphasizing similarities over differences. It is the common ornateness to connect people for what they hold in common, but the same people dismiss the value of differences that makes every soul unique. It will harness the individuals' diversity to contain the challenges efficiently and will also comprise the unleashing of corporatism. Different talents brought to the table on individuals term are the most significant unifier of the constituents than their similarities.Harnessing the decentralized independent collaboration of individuals has more collective power than the efforts of the constituents of the centralized system as a single unit. So, maybe it is time to get out of the dark side of rhetoric and pursue the bright facet of realism.medium.com",25/07/2019,0,0,20,2,875,330,2,0,0,3,624
Why I changed my mind in purchasing Vietnam property,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/why-i-changed-my-mind-in-purchasing-vietnam-property-d3e8c82aad57,JOHN CHAN,16,4,714,"Vietnam came to my attention after Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital. Out of curiosity, I started to research a bit on Vietnam, and I found that the GDP growth is quite impressive which is around 7% in 2018. The recent figure of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is on a record high of US$16.74 billion, a year-on-year increase of 69 percent.As a young man, natural instinct and capitalism push me to look at investment opportunities like property. And as a data analyst, I look at investment opportunities through collecting and finding insights in data.I scrapped more than a thousand pages of property data from Batdongsan, a famous local property site, and tried to do some analysis.The average return calculated is 6.37 percent. The return is pretty high if you compared it with Hong Kong (around 2 to 3 percent). The meaning of the return of a property is how much cash flow will be generated each year compared with the property price (r = cashflow_year/property price). This can also be regarded as the return in the perpetuity formula (PV = D/r ‚Üí property price = cashflow_year/r).After doing the average of the whole Ho Chi Minh city, and Hanoi city, I thought I found an opportunity! Then I started to look closer. What about the return in different districts in the city? (Preciously I am an Environmental Consultant, so I used GIS .)For Ho Chi Minh city, you can tell from the figure immediately that District 1 is the city center with the highest average price. And the return in districts surrounding the center is quite good. A 5% return can be seen everywhere. (I am so excited!)And Hanoi too!Price is another big factor. The property price in Hong Kong is one of the highest around the World. The down payment to purchase one average size property in Hong Kong can afford a full payment of a pretty decent apartment in Vietnam. You can take a closer look at the above 2 figures. In Ho Chi Minh City, even for the city center, District 1, the median property price is just 130k.Haven‚Äôt said that, the property price is not very affordable for locals. In Ho Chi Minh City, the average salary is around USD 300.After the amendment of Housing Law in 2015, foreigners who are permitted to enter Vietnam are eligible to own property.The strongest proof of ownership is the Certificate of Land Use Right and Ownership of House and Other Assets on the Land. In short, Pink Book.But it is not easy to get Pink Book for foreigners. Theoretically, after the amendment of Housing Law, foreigners are eligible to get the Pink Book which is the ownership. However, foreign nationals are not allowed to own houses in land areas zoned for national defense and security, and at the provincial level, departments may not have a list of projects where foreign nationals are allowed to buy (For Hanoi, it seems that they have a list in March 2018). Some property agents told me that they never see foreigners got a pink book. Some property agents told me they see it. The information is conflicting.Then you may ask, why they purchased the property if they cannot get the pink book. There are other arrangements, including the Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA), and the Long-term Lease Agreement (LTLA). They are usually signed with the property developers.Financing is not like Hong Kong. It is difficult to get a mortgage, and the interest rate is high, say 10%. Therefore, even for the locals, they pay in full.If you have the money, it is good. But, if you do not, you need to look at other financing methods, for example, personal loans. But, the tenor is too short that you need to wait a few years to have a positive cash flow from your property.As a data analyst, it is my common practice to tackle a problem by first looking at data. But, actually, there are more factors to consider. If I can look at the legislation, and protection of ownership first, I may not need to spend hours to write a program to scrape the web.It is just like a decision tree. You use the factor with the highest information gain first. :)",25/07/2019,1,0,0,0,1050,695,2,0,0,2,48
Big data & its Big Bias problem,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/big-data-its-big-bias-problem-a7ec955abdb7,Pratyush Choudhury,480,8,1796,"Data is increasingly becoming the de-facto medium governing most of the decision-making processes around us. From healthcare to financial services, from retail to public policymaking, data analytics is truly shaping our lives. In the past 9 weeks, I got the chance to work on some real ‚Äúbig‚Äù data (a sample screenshot is attached below and this doesn‚Äôt contain any images/videos/audio).And the deeper I went, the more I realized the limitations (and power) of data-driven decision making. The fundamental flaw of data-driven hypothesis or decision making is that the manner in which data is collected, measured, and analyzed can lead to biased and incomplete information which can then significantly impact the desired outcomes. For example, the following is an excerpt from The Gates‚Äô Notes: 2019 Edition. Over the course of this article, I aim to drill down to the specifics and highlight the ethical and people considerations in data collection and artificial intelligence.You might want to grab some coffee before this starts!!Data CollectionTechnology makes it easier to collect/generate data than ever before. While many consider this to be a boon, this can prove to be otherwise. There‚Äôre a lot of problems around the process of collecting the data, the contents of the data and if the content is right for the relevant stakeholders. Let‚Äôs understand with an example ‚Äî Recently my state, Odisha, got hit by a deadly cyclone named Fani. It wreaked havoc which caused power blackouts across several parts of the state. Social media emerged as a great tool for spreading information and awareness like certain power stations getting up and running or certain ATMs starting to function or the availability of generators at certain shops.The problem, however, was in the non-uniform nature of the spread of information. Not everyone understands social media equally. Some people followed the prescribed/popular hashtags like #fanicycloneupdates and #cyclonefani. But given the nature of the disaster and the uncertainties surrounding it, some similar hashtags began emerging ‚Äî #fanicycloneeffect and #fanicyclone. Now if the central government wanted to analyze the outbreak and spread of this entire social-media campaign, which hashtags do they start with? All should be your guess.However, where and how do you start? Do you choose all the hashtags which have ‚Äúcyclone‚Äù and ‚Äúfani‚Äù in it? How do you know you‚Äôve covered the exhaustive list of hashtags? Let‚Äôs assume you did, But what if someone posted news or shared images/video clips about the power going off or people getting injured (which tend to be a bit serious in nature) without hashtags? What about the accounts from the eyewitnesses? How do we capture that bit of precious data about those situations?A frail but logical conclusion at this point in time could be ‚Äî the ones who are more visible in the datasets ends up receiving more help but sadly are also among the more privileged ones. A similar but far more detailed account is covered by Bill and Melinda Gates on the absence of data about women and girls on sensitive topics like health and development.Conclusion: The amount of data involved in research and analysis today is fairly biased towards those who understand the intricacies of the platforms from which data is collected.Solution?: Building more generalized models which are adaptable for different situations. For example, it‚Äôll be helpful to keep in mind that the absence of water in a locality could be caused due to a cyclone cutting down electricity in that locality and also due to depleting groundwater table. Rushing to a conclusion without evaluating various possibilities would be the wrong approach.Data consumption and algorithmic ‚Äúbias‚ÄùWhile algorithms can enable advocacy and accountability, algorithmic bias can have serious implications. Consider a hypothetical character and a situation‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMr. X. His social media activity will be monitored before approving his¬†motor¬†insurance¬†claims. And Mr. X only uploads his fond memories from trips where he clocked 130 kmph on his social media handle¬†and¬†also¬†sports¬†a¬†picture¬†of¬†a¬†fast¬†sports¬†car¬†in¬†his¬†display¬†picture. Now Mr. X gets involved in a genuine accident and needs to process a claim. But after analyzing his social media feed, the insurance company associates his one status update about clocking a very high speed and the sportscar in his display picture to conclude he‚Äôs a reckless driver and cancels his claim. Mr. X is in shock because he didn‚Äôt upload about the numerous accounts of the short and steady trips on his sedan to his social media handle.Let‚Äôs consider another more relatable example. If you live in India and are a millennial, chances are that you would have heard about the Ola Credit cars or Paytm Postpaid. These companies use your spend patterns of their apps to determine your credit score and end up giving you (the millennials, without any history of credit score) postpaid or credit card-esque products. This is a wonderful way for us (I‚Äôm a millennial) to get access to financial products which we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have. However, there‚Äôs a small catch ‚Äî not all millennials are active earning members. Hence, the transactions I make on these platforms are with the money of my parents. So in a way, these companies are using the money I get from my parents and spend on their platforms to assign me a credit score. Not sure if there are any background mechanisms to check this but even with them, not sure how accurate their metrics are.Anecdote: I got less balance on Paytm Postpaid as I am an Android user compared to a friend who uses iOS. Both of us took money from our parents to buy those devices.With algorithms not far from determining (dictating?) a large portion of our lives, it‚Äôs critical to put measures in place which understand who is represented in the data and how. Imagine self-driving cars being taught who to kill/save during a mishap by algorithms. Now if I were to use historical data for training, then there would always be certain groups, like minorities, against which the system would hold an inherent bias.Conclusion: Since the algorithms only know what you show them, it‚Äôs important to place mechanisms which check for who is represented in the data and how.Solution?: The current state of the art Machine Learning techniques ‚Äî neural networks ‚Äî tend to be like black boxes even for the researchers who develop them. While neural networks automate the process of feature extraction, we need to understand them better which will help us justify and explain their decisions. There‚Äôs another latent side which many don‚Äôt notice. Most of AI today are deployed in complex environments. The output of one becomes the input for the other and should an issue arise, this creates a lot of chaos troubleshooting because you wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know where it originated. Until then, humans and machines need to work together.https://cdn.technologyreview.com/v/images/ab01.gif.mp4?sw=550Ethical implications and user sensitivitiesThis time we are taking a real-life example to understand to drive the point home. There was an explosive headline in a Forbes article in 2012 about how Target determined the pregnancy of a teenager before her father did. Let‚Äôs try and understand why they did this before diving into how.For retail powerhouses like Target, marketing is an effective strategy to prevent customer churn. For a consumer, the purchasing habits change with significant life events ‚Äî after marriage or buying a new house, you would probably buy more furniture/utensils. So if you‚Äôre in the marketing team and you‚Äôre able to anticipate when customers are going through a life-changing event, you can effectively target your ads and earn their loyalty and maybe get a step closer to that dream promotion you‚Äôve been wanting all along.Let‚Äôs now understand how they did it. They looked at the data from women who had baby registries with their large number of stores, merged that with the customer demographics and identified a list of 25 products, which when bought in combination would probably mean the woman was pregnant. Even better, based on the type of products one purchases, Target identified the pregnancy‚Äôs trimester, thereby predicting the baby‚Äôs approximate due date. This, in turn, would allow you to market specific products depending on the due date. Andrew Pole described this in a Predictive Analytics World Conference.Now legally Target didn‚Äôt illegally breach any privacy laws. It used the data about its customers available on its internal platforms, matched this with external publicly available data. The fact that you can learn something private about your customers being on the right side of the law doesn‚Äôt make it ethically appropriate.Conclusion: Just because you can do it, doesn‚Äôt mean you should.Solution?: Try selling this to the analyst in the marketing team and chances are you pissed him off already. How can you ensure you don‚Äôt creep out your customers and also leverage smart strategies by your employees? Be subtle! If you‚Äôre going to be predicting something as sensitive as this, try to be subtle in the way you use this information and communicate with the customer. Target did do something like this. They started camouflaging coupons for baby products with totally unrelated things (thereby ensuring customers don‚Äôt use them). Customers also loved using the coupons as long as they believed (or Target made them believe?) that the company didn‚Äôt know anything private.Concluding notesTechnology is making giant strides and will continue to do so. In the process, hopefully, it will end up transforming our lives for the better. However, there are things which are extremely important but are overlooked. One is that we need to pay more attention to the data generation process. As systems start learning continuously, it‚Äôs all the more important to think how we arrived at the dataset ‚Äî what were the decisions which went behind deciding what to collect and from whom, where to store it and how and how to analyze and represent it. Another important thing is the metrics we define. How do you measure ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù for a search engine like Google? Do you consider the time spent on the website and clicks? But there would be many situations where these activities don‚Äôt necessarily reflect any form of relevance. How do you define customer satisfaction, let alone measure it? The gaps in how we measure it will definitely affect certain groups.I am certainly not an expert but every challenge is an opportunity and I would like to put forth opinions that could do their tiny bit and really change the situation into win-win for all.Hit the Applause, üëè, button if you would want to encourage a 22-year-old writer.

Java: Why You Remove Unused Imports,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/java-why-you-remove-unused-imports-7a3327a0b877,Isa Weaver,72,2,278,"I just got my code review and one of the first comments was to remove my unused imports. It's a quick fix, literally just delete them. However, it led me to wonder what's wrong if they stay? There weren‚Äôt any issues with my code, it ran perfectly. However, there are two main reasons to remove them.If another developer is searching through code for something, its a pain to look through your code and discover what they were looking for was a false flag. It is simply bad coding practice because code needs to be readable for the other developers who follow after.www.datadriveninvestor.comYour unused import could have naming conflicts with another import in this case that is actually being used. The annoying warning sign is one thing, however, forcing yourself to write a different name simply to fix this import error. A real-world example is below:There was an improper import that a developer had used and abandoned (they used the class, auto-imported it, and then realized it was a mistake). That unused import pulled in a whole separate tier of the application which, while the IDE isn‚Äôt configured to separate them, the build process is. That single import dragged in so many classes that the compiler attempted to compile without having the relevant dependent libraries in the classpath, that this caused so many issues that it caused the out of memory error. It took an hour to solve this problem caused by an unused import. ‚Äî Yashai, StackOverFlowSo the lesson of the day, be a good developer remove your unused imports before committing your code. If you can think of more reasons please reach out and let me know.",25/07/2019,1,0,0,0,875,399,2,0,0,2,64
3 Powerful Trust Signals to Unlock Your Fintech Startup‚Äôs Growth,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/3-powerful-trust-signals-to-unlock-your-fintech-startups-growth-cb13f75d09b1,Anthony Back,763,6,1041,"Fintech startups are often great at technology, UX, and design but tend to struggle to acquire customers. One of the main reasons for this is a failure to recognise the critical role trust plays in customer acquisition.Building trust is equally as vital to success as the quality or usefulness of a product or service because people ONLY buy things from companies they trust. This is especially the case in fintech, where money, livelihoods and sensitive data are involved.www.datadriveninvestor.comStartups need to fill the trust gap to grow. The question is, how?The answer is to develop trust signals. These are like indicators or markers which illustrate credibility and trustworthiness to potential customers.Effective content creation is about building credibility and relationships between your startup and the target audience. It‚Äôs not about pumping out loads of average content to promote your product or service. You have to be committed to selflessly providing value, or else all your efforts will only get mediocre results. Average content that‚Äôs too ‚Äòsalesy‚Äô can even make your startup look untrustworthy.Take a look at these findings.The benefits are clear. But you have to do it the right way.Here‚Äôs the thing about your customers. They won‚Äôt immediately trust your company any more than they would immediately trust a stranger. They want to know you understand their needs. That you comprehend their concerns and problems and have the right solution to solve them. In other words, they need you to show some credibility before they can start trusting you.Content is one of the best ways of communicating your credibility and expertise. It‚Äôs also a way to increase your startup‚Äôs online visibility. With 67% of a B2B buyer‚Äôs journey now done digitally, creating content has never been so important.Start by developing content that addresses key questions your target audience is seeking answers to. What problems do they face? You could also build content that illustrates knowledge, insight, and expertise on the market, industry trends, etc.Here‚Äôs an example ‚ÄîIf your target customers are banks or other highly regulated financial companies, compliance is a huge deal, right? Creating content which demonstrates an understanding and insights into specific and relevant compliance-related challenges can go along way to developing credibility and speeding up the sales cycle.The options are endless, but all valuable content has one thing in common. It‚Äôs useful to your audience. Don‚Äôt just create content for clicks or page views. Develop content your audience cares about and aspire to become a go-to resource.People almost always look at the actions of others to guide their decision-making process. Social proof is about using a third party to influence your target customers buying decisions.When you browse a website and see a testimonial from a customer or industry expert, that‚Äôs social proof. When you search a company on google and find a customer case study, that‚Äôs another example of social proof.Case Studies: These are vastly under leveraged. Case studies are a data-driven, in-depth report of your product or service‚Äôs implementation and the achieved results. By providing evidence of real business benefits and ROI, case studies can position your company as an authority and build credibility. They studies carry a lot of weight with buyers, especially when used at the right time.Testimonials/Reviews: These satisfy people‚Äôs need for validation when making a decision. They make people feel more confident about connecting with your company because they convey credibility through an independent party. According to G2 Crowd, 92% of B2B buyers are more likely to make a purchase after reading a trusted review. Another study by Trustradius found that 62% of B2B decision-makers consider peer recommendations a powerful purchasing trigger.Trust icons & Certifications: Did you receive funding from a well-known investor? Get mentioned in a respected industry publication? Maybe you partnered with an industry-leading organization or have achieved some certification? These are significant trust signals which should be shared. Add logos to your website, and anywhere else you see fit to create credibility. However, don‚Äôt go overboard. Adding an icon for everything and anything you‚Äôre part of will work against you. Keep it relevant and exclusive.Business Credentials: Promoting your business credentials adds a tremendous amount of credibility and trust to your company. Showing the number of customers you have, or listing well-known customers are two such examples of business credentials. Even if you only have a few test customers, don‚Äôt be afraid to share their logos on your site.Social Media: Developing a presence on social media platforms and building a following adds credibility because it allows engagement with people and lets others see this engagement. Engagement creates trust as it shows you‚Äôre reachable and committed to building a long term business that‚Äôs passionate about what it does. When it comes to followers, having thousands on your social media profiles can be viewed as a widespread endorsement of your company.Financial institutions remain by far the most trusted providers of financial services. They have built up trust through longstanding relationships and decades of visibility. Engaging in partnerships and collaborations is all about leveraging trust from these incumbents and other more established brands. Trust you don‚Äôt have.FinTech firms‚Äô primary competitive advantages are their agility to launch and pivot, their laser focus on customer experience, and their freedom from the burden of legacy systems. However, they also face challenges in scaling their business due to a lack of trust, absence of a known brand, an established distribution infrastructure, capital, and regulatory compliance expertise that, historically, are the strengths of incumbent firms.‚Äî World Fintech Report 2018Beyond credibility, and trust, partnerships, and collaborations are also a fantastic way to build visibility and an excellent approach to drive innovation and get access to a large customer base.If you enter into a partnership or collaboration with a well-known brand remember to communicate it wherever you can ‚Äî on your company website, emails, announcements, and through other forms of content.I‚Äôm always interested in meeting founders and technologists who are working on challenging projects, so please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.I‚Äôm a technology analyst, content marketer, and writer who creates high-value content for Fintech and Blockchain companies. I have worked with some of the largest financial institutions in the world and leading tech companies to identify and communicate real insights that drive thought leadership, build trust, and attract customers.

Lessons in Management from El Profesor,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/lessons-in-management-from-el-profesor-bc2c8584d88,Shayan Khomami,70,5,889,"Personally, I have become obsessed with the Netflix creation ‚ÄòLa Casa De Papel‚Äô, or ‚ÄòMoney Heist‚Äô. Originally setting out on a binge with the goal of simple entertainment, I quickly realized there is so much more to this series than first meets the eye.I can‚Äôt recall many series that I‚Äôve learned so many lessons in business and management from ‚Äì not quite what you‚Äôd expect from a show about a group of criminals, wearing masks of Salvador Dali, breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain‚Ä¶One character, in particular, exemplifies these lessons and we could all benefit from understanding his approach to problem-solving on a massive scale. That character is, of course, the illustrious ‚ÄòEl Profesor‚Äô, so adequately named for someone that studies everything required to achieve his desired outcomes. I‚Äôve consolidated his covert lessons into 4 key themes:The first principle that stands out from the beginning all the way to the end of the series is that of El Profesor‚Äôs comprehensive, meticulous preparation and planning.His design-thinking approach optimizes the project for the happy path ‚Äì that is, the desired outcome, however, he always has a detailed plan for all different variations on what could actually develop. He assesses the risks upfront and throughout and can, therefore, react to them in real-time, should anything not go as expected. The details are key here; from roles and responsibilities to the step-by-step process that must be followed to achieve the end-goal.Furthermore, it is not just about assessing the internal possibilities and their outcomes, we also note the importance of knowing your opposition as well. This is a concept that has transgressed across all industries, from competitive sports, where top performers must assess their opponents‚Äô techniques, strengths, and weaknesses, all the way to military strategy, where commanders must understand everything from their opponents capabilities to the terrain of battle (Sun Tzu‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Art of War‚Äô comes to mind). El Profesor, like a grand chess master, displays this ruthless analysis by knowing everything about how the police, the public, and the press will think, act and respond.This translates in business terms as knowing both the capabilities within your own team and organisation, but also having a deep understanding of external factors as well. What are our competitors doing? What are the industry trends? What are the current forces driving changes in the market?And finally, when all the details and outcomes are mapped out in great detail, he can adequately train both himself and his team ‚Äì allowing the effective execution of all necessary actions.Secondly, El Profesor‚Äòs prevalent objectivity and rationality is one resembling that of a Stoic philosopher. It appears that he is in an almost meditative state, in a deep state of flow.He is in control of his own emotions and knows to trust the process.There is no room for instinctual emotions clouding his judgment and he proceeds forward methodically.Of course, detailed preparation as explained in the previous point is an essential pre-requisite to be able to do this confidently.El Professor would probably be the first person to quote Isaac Newton: ‚ÄúIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.‚Äù We all know that good leadership includes empowering and engaging your team, and he does this flawlessly, displaying emphatic levels of emotional intelligence.‚ÄúIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.‚Äù ‚Äì Isaac NewtonThe truth is, The Professor would not be able to achieve his goals so effectively were it not for his great people skills. First, he understands each of his team members on an individual front, not on a one-size-fits-all approach. He understands their backgrounds, their emotional behaviors and what drives them. With this, he knows exactly how to motivate them to perform at their best and, subsequently, empowers them to do just that, showing great empathy and trust.This is critical in business, as, being in a management position or not, we all need to learn how to work with different personalities in order to truly collaborate and achieve our goals.Moving away from strategy and onto El Profesor‚Äôs vision, it is clear, throughout, that he is not afraid to think big. Very big. This should be taken as a reminder for all of us to never hesitate and never limit our goals, for the purpose of making them more ‚Äòachievable‚Äô, as most of us tend to do to avoid crashing and burning, or the embarrassment of ‚Äòfailure‚Äô.In fact, it is the grandest of plans and the greatest of visions that truly inspire us and motivate us to take the necessary actions. When you are feeling tired, demotivated or even just procrastinating, it is only the grand vision that picks you up and enables you to keep moving forward. So think big, on a massive scale.It is only the grand vision that picks you up and enables you to keep moving forwards.La Casa De Papel has done an incredible job of taking our attention by storm, encapsulating many, like myself, in its captivating, nail-biting plot and sub-plots. Each of the characters cries out to different sides of us, engaging different emotions. Above all, there is one character, the leader and architect, El Profesor, adequately named, that sticks with us more than the rest.His timeless lessons of business and management, if followed, would benefit us all tremendously and make us more effective.Bella Ciao.",25/07/2019,0,0,18,0,935,530,4,0,0,0,38

How to Improve any Meeting,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/kill-all-unproductive-meetings-d2ddba39f87e,Jasper RuijsüöÄ,107,22,4412,"Let‚Äôs face the truth.Decision making is hard.We face the same problems top-down and bottom-up in any organization.www.datadriveninvestor.comOn the executive level, we face problems like miscommunication in the chain the command, egocentrism, and bias.Likewise, on the team level, we face the fear of disagreement with the consensus, avoidance of conflict, favoritism, opinion alignment or clique forming, and an inability to access creative group thinking.The above is only the group problems, on the individual level, we can experience the inability to listen, to tell the story or idea with clarity, emotional disturbance, decreased attention span, etc.Be honest with yourself how often have you been to a meeting this month where you had to be present, where you were not able to contribute as you had expected for a variety of reasons.After this tiresome meeting, you went home while wondering why you went in the first place to that meeting, which seemed like a waste of time.Modern business models like lean thinking and agile product development have decreased a lot of these communication problems with introducing sprints and scrums.In short, in a scrum viable information is shared between multiple teams, for example, the overall process of a project, the learned lessons, the (potential) roadblocks, and introductions of new involved parties like shareholders, new team members, or outsourced experts.A sprint crunches months of work in a week by working together in a multidisciplinary approach to streamline efforts of the entire company.In a sprint, a certain creative meeting format is used that optimizes efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore optimizing the timeline and the budget on any product-, service -or strategy development.Instead of running into difficulties at a later stage because of miscommunication, for example between the production team and the marketing department, one member of each team is included in the sprint.Inspired by growth hacking, sprinting uses the rapid experimentation, in which first a minimal viable product, service, or strategy is tested.When the result of the experiment proves conclusive you double down.Both the scrum and the sprint achieve an open space in which employees dare to fail and are allowed to have controversial opinions. They combine the strengths of time management, design thinking to stimulate open and efficient communication.These systems are built on the premise that conflict should be avoided, therefore they require a high team spirit before the start of such an endeavor.Therefore there are, according to me, three levels of understanding a team can reach.2. A superb team understands each members‚Äô psychology. In other words, they know how to adjust their communication according to each personality.3. An excellent team grasps the philosophical foundations of the member‚Äôs decisions making. They understand what makes everyone tick.Most organizations, companies, NGOs, have a lot of the first level teams.Multinationals usually have time to time team-building exercises, in which people learn about the mental preferences of others in their team.But MBTI, The Big 5, Enneagram and other psychological tests have yet to enter the mainstream culture.In very few top-notch companies like Bridgewater Associates LP, they have systemized team building, management, and communication in a framework of principles that only produce consistently excellent teams.What often happens in smaller companies and organizations which do not have a large pool to fish out off, that they use two metrics to create functional teams.Decision fatigue is the process in which no consensus can be reached about a topic because of misunderstanding, clashing values, misinformation, or a lack of leadership in a group.Decision fatigue can decrease cognition, productivity, social awareness of any team member in any kind of team.Problem is that mutual agreement leads to bias, tunnel vision, conventional creativity of thought.So we are back to square one.Too much alignment or disagreement are equally unsubstantial to any communication within a team.What Myrna and Greg Lewis figured out was that conflict has a great potential for challenging the status quo and maximizing team efforts.They created the framework of Deep Democracy, which can be used in any meeting and will significantly increase productivity, effectiveness, efficiency, on the individual and team level.Deep democracy, which is the best system, according to me, ever made to prevent decision fatigue.Before giving a blueprint, let‚Äôs discuss the psychology behind it.The deep democracy system is founded on the principle that the avoidance of conflict will lead to worse decisions than when consensus is assured by for example team profiling.The framework uses theory from quantum physics, psycho-analysis, conflict studies, communication science, and psychology.Either called quantum positioning or quantum opinions.It is based on the principle of superposition in quantum physicsIn human reality, an object has a fixed locus. In the quantum, realm objects can be at multiple positions or ‚Äòplaces‚Äô at the same time.It means that depending on when a human observes a particle it will be either in state 0 or 1.What is the connection with communication?Our individual opinion is formed based on a unique decision-making system.These mental preferences are based on personality, experience, bias and available information.When people are thinking they are synthesizing a mental map that guides us towards a certain decision.On the surface of all communication is what is expressed either through speech, text, image or body language.Quantum positioning argues that people hold a multitude of positions or opinions.The opinion that is expressed in the group, went through a rigorous system of mental preferences and is the result of comparing alternatives to each other.Though there are more positions stored in the unconscious mind, which are not available yet in thinking, because they are too abstract for the mind to quantify or to add different values to it.In deep democracy, all communication takes place in two dimensions: the collective space and the individual zone.Every dimension has three different levels: the conscious or spoken level, the subconscious or thinking level, and the unconscious or inaccessible level.Like an iceberg, there is more matter below the surface of the water than above.The dimensions identify the locus of the information. Whereas the level talks about the accessibility of the information.So the definitions are :The process of group consensus is similar to the process of an assembly line.The line is the group streams of consciousness, with the products as metaphors for topics or ideas.The machines that add to the product, are the individuals, who according to their setting, otherwise called mental preferences add value to the topic in question.These topics go through a packing machine, which is like a conscious collective mind, which roots the idea down in reality.It connects all different settings of the individual in a fitting compromise. That aligns with the companies or groups mission.All the people or machines in this example are powered by the same source, the unconscious or mental energy (/electricity) needed for thinking.The term Deep Democracy was first coined by the psycho-therapist Arnold Mindell.Democracy because all views within a certain subject are equally important.Deep because the group goes into depth below the surface horizon of communication or ‚Äòall that is communicated‚Äô.Though, Deep Democracy differs a lot from psychoanalysis because the dissection of everyone‚Äôs subconscious would be time inefficient.Furthermore, the unconscious is not filled with repressed information.Instead, it is better explained as untapped creative potential.These dimensions and levels are present in any conversation with people in a physical space.I have created an example, to illustrate how quantum positioning, the dimensions, and levels interact with each other.Imagine working for an electric car manufacturer which has multiple teams.Because Tesla chooses to share his patents with the public, many start-ups have joined the market, capitalizing on the Elon Musk good deed for humanity.Higher management came up with some ideas to reduce the risk of falling out with the competition.The executive branch suggests a re-allocation of a significant part of the marketing budget.The company has a clear policy on budget allocation and will first visit the lower teams to get additional feedback or other ideas.A meeting is set up between the leaders of the separate teams and Jane of HR is chosen as the facilitator because she has such good people skills.Jane is well aware that this can become a heated argument and that she is biased towards the marketing team as she was once a member of that the department and still has some good friends there.In case of a standoff during a vote, she has chosen to not participate in voting because she does not want to choose between her friends and the company.In the meeting, seven people are present including Jane herself.When Jane asks for feedback on the proposal of the higher management. The people are not fond of it but they agree that it is necessary for survival and start brainstorming.Everyone in the room starts brainstorming on alternatives because they agree that the proposal values certain factors inadequately.The Marketing Director argues that they have started with growth hacking, which has significantly reduced the financial risk of having bad ad-campaigns and can take a little cut back.The Sales Director tells people that they are transitioning to a new CRM and need their budget for the CRM-education of his team.The Lead Product Developer and Product Designer agree that they can take some cutbacks as long as it will not challenge the current mission of the company.The Head of Compliance and Legal Services says that he is willing to cut staff by hiring some new talent in the form of a traineeship.The Director of Customer Services stands his ground that he and his team had taken some cutbacks last time when the company had faced a crisis and argues that it is someone else turn.Everybody lists a proposal and tells them the group individually what they seem to think as the best approach.Because many proposals are a look-alike, people group up to make a stronger case.The result is two proposals:Proposal A: The financial disadvantage should be spread fairly. In other words, it should be applied to all of the departments which can take a hit because they are not vital to the lifeline of the company.Proposal B: Leans into the upper management proposal for cut-offs, but insist that a 10% cut will have the same benefits as was proposed in the initial plan, because of the increased productivity by using growth hacking and a new CRM.Proposal A is backed by the Lead Product Developer and Product Designer because product development is crucial for staying ahead of the competition.Proposal B is supported by the Director of Customer Services and Director of Sales because their teams wouldn‚Äôt have to cut on the budget.After some persuasion, the Director of Marketing joins team A and the Head of Compliance and Legal Services the team B.Now Jane has a conundrum.Both parties have a valid argumentation structure to back up their claims.Jane tries to weight her perspective on the cons and pros of each plan both fears her decision making is not able to escape bias.The Conflict PerspectiveIf we take the bird‚Äôs eye view, we see that in the collective consciousness of the meeting two opinions have taken their ground, facing each other headstrong like in a boxing match.Much of the individual subconscious thinking has been brought to the light of consciousness.You can see the quantum positioning where multiple individuals have kind of the same approach to fixing the problem.You can see that multiple individuals were willing to give something back or even compromise on what they have set out to with their respective teams, based a variety of reasons.If we were to visualize their mental maps, you would see a lot of shared arguments which lead to some to ‚Äòan agreement with‚Äô and to others to ‚Äòa disagreement with‚Äô.LeadershipBeing a good leader means protecting the interests of the team members they represent in this meeting to the best of their ability, without distancing themselves from the company‚Äôs principles and mission.Thus everybody stands their grounds.The result is a conflict of interests.If the world was black and white and people were part of the Homo Economicus group there would have been a clear winner.According to me, almost nobody can be objective or rational in any decision involving people‚Äôs lives. Unless you are a sociopath or psychopath.What process-oriented psychology has found out is that each individual can still be turned to either side or gain a new perspective, if a new insight is shared.In the mental realm, they are then able to conceptualize some of their ideas in the background of the mind by giving them values.Thus ideas are then extracted from the unconscious level and put in the subconscious level.Hence in the collective unconscious, where all abstract thought is grouped, there is always a variety of alternative opinions stored.The unconscious collective is like a collection of raindrops(ideas) on a car window, that stick to their positions.Unless they come in contact with another raindrop (external information), giving it the necessary momentum and gravity to fall downwards (changing the positioning within the group).So every team has this odd goose(s), who has an abnormal view on the matter at hand, compared to the other views that were expressed.What most of the times happens is that when this odd goose comes up with such a perspective he or she chooses to forfeit that controversial position because out of fear of being attacked by both sides in a (heated) argument.Process-oriented psychology insists that the entire group will reassess their position after hearing this unique perspective.By doing so the group can access some part of their Individual Unconscious, which then adds to the Collective Consciousness.This access to the unconscious collective changes the overall direction of the group for the better.The odd goose is this example is Jerry, the Director of Customer Services. He has secretly been working on a plan to decrease the cost and improve the profit margin. Jerry plans, with the use of inhouse development, to create a chatbot, which will allow his staff to focus on the improvement of the FAQ, call and text services, etc.This project is going on for a couple of months but Jerry has not yet all the facts worked out or detailed forecast available for a viable proposal.Last time, when Jerry gave an idea to his superiors, without the research to back it up, the plan backfired. Because of Jerry‚Äôs hard-working ethics, management took a leap of faith.A strategy without a roadmap or the other way around is most of the time doomed to fail.The plan was unsuccessful, and management blamed Jerry, which set back set back his career path a few years.Now he is a director but he is not willing to risk his position to take the chance.Jerry excels as at future thinking, but one of his weakness is recognizing the other people‚Äôs creative capabilities.Little does he know that Elisa and Tom of Lead Product Developer and Lead Designer have had similar ideas for a customer service chatbot, but have not yet found time to discuss a potential collaboration.Elisa had already a timetable in mind and Tom has sketched some UI ideas in his bullet journal.Both Elisa and Tom are highly creative people, which means they have a lot of ideas, of which the chatbot idea is one of the hundred.They both have a detail-oriented personality which means that their focus is entirely on this meeting by campaigning for proposal A, which means than their creative ideas are for now pushed to the background.In other words, their creative ideas are kept at the unconscious level.Through the lens of deep democracy, sharing (conflicting/) controversial information will allow other individuals to gain insight by re-evaluating their positioning in a certain topicEvery time new information is shared there is a trigger in one of the three levels.If the deep democracy system was in place, the facilitator would have extracted Jeries idea out of his subconscious, which would move Elisa‚Äôs and Toms ideas from the unconscious to the subconscious.In doing so, the group would reach the maximal creative thinking potential at that moment available.To summarize, Process-oriented psychology findingsBesides access to the collective unconscious, deep democracy also prevents the tendency of our the reptilian part of the brain to become biased towards certain individuals in the group.This bias is most often created by the halo-effect: if admire a certain character we are more likely to believe such a person.For example, if Tim Ferris, writer of the bestseller The Four Hour Workweek, were to claim how to efficiently manage your time to produce better books.I would be less inclined to question his authority on the subject because he is a very accomplished writer in our times.From a purely objective perspective one could argue that even though he has written many books in his career, his primary focus present-day is the podcast called the Tim Ferris Show.According to this reasoning, more active writers would probably have better insights on writing books.Besides the halo effect, you have a gender bias, observer- expectancy effects, expert bias, and the bias list goes on and on.There are 175 biases according to author Buster Benson who wrote the book Why Are We Yelling, which is about the art of productive disagreement.Furthermore, Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow, argues that because the biases list is vast, no individual will ever be able to always be on his or her guard for biases.Even McKinsey‚Äôs agrees that it is inherent to the nature of men to be biased, which is expressed in their article Distortions and deceptions in strategic decisions,Companies can‚Äôt afford to ignore the human factor in the making of strategic decisions. They can greatly improve their chances of making good ones by becoming more aware of the way cognitive biases can mislead them, by reviewing their decision-making processes, and by establishing a culture of constructive debate.Hence, our consciousness would never be able to keep track of all the biases in our thinking.Instead of becoming nihilistic saying mankind is doomed to dysfunctional communication because of cognitive bias.I would say that most bias can be solved by brutal honesty and the facilitation of efficient communication.If Deep Democracy was in place Jerry would have shared his thoughts.Now I will give you a framework for implementing Deep Democracy in any meeting.There are in total five phases of which four our mandatory for Deep Democracy.You start with deciding who will be the facilitator in this meeting. I recommend picking the person with the highest emotional intelligence instead of the person who has the best leadership qualities. Always vote with hands.Likewise in the sprints, the facilitator creates the open space for dialogue and will hold people accountable for their behavior.The facilitator has no voting power, so if you are the leader and have a clear vision for this meeting, try to not to become the facilitator.If so you can still inject ideas but you will no be able to back up them if it comes to a vote.The other people in the meeting have equal standing. No exceptions are made for a CEO or higher executives when they join.Then continue to determine who will take the secretary duty. Someone who prefers listening over speaking or has the natural talent for summarising or quick typing can be a good pick.I would always recommend people to switch regularly between the roles.People will then be able to perceive how every personality approaches leadership, summarization, diagnosis, etc.Over time, the group will improve in understanding the different communication styles.First, the facilitator starts with a ‚Äòscrum like‚Äô opening question, which called the check-in phase.Here are some examples:These questions raise the group‚Äôs sympathy awareness, helping those who are not able to identify that through the use of body language or intuition.Also, it serves as an exercise for training empathy within a group.Pro-tip, keep it light and breezy and emphasize short but direct communication.Then the facilitator asks every attendee in the meeting to first think of some subjects they want to talk about and writes them on a whiteboard.Then people can propose ideas for an order of talking.The group votes again by hands and the facilitator picks the winning order.Before moving on the facilitator has to ask the people who did not support the winning order, if they want to add some rules or are fine with the consensus.Some rules that you can insist on:Vote again, most people will compromise when the argumentation is valid for the change.Some tips on the order of the topics.After trying out deep democracy in an Education Advice Team responsible for the coordination of other teams, that were shaping a year program for students of the Bildung Academy.We learned that updates can be best placed first in the topic order because an ‚Äòinsignificant‚Äô report can stir up a lot of new ideas in the other team members.By prioritizing reporting you prevent a return back to a topic, that was already finalized.Then continue with brainstorming or decision making.BrainstormingFor brainstorming, the facilitator has to empty the minds of the group.Making spider webs or use post-it notes to write down as many ideas in a fixed amount of time (10 or 5 min works best).Then if you want to get the best ideas, let people create organically groups of similar ideas or let people pick any idea which is not theirs and give them a set pitching time (3 to 5 min) to explain why this idea is in the best interest of the company or organization, etc.If you are looking for some other creative exercises look at SessionLabs.Decision-makingFor decision-making, the facilitator asks each individual to elaborate on their position.The facilitator summarizes this position by writing it on the whiteboard, so others aren‚Äôt able to forget the other perspectives.Often time these summarised versions are corrected by the opinion holders when they are written down because of the usage of unspecific words.Also, this aid the option holder in structuring his thoughts to make them crystal clear for the other attendees.Then after the inventory round is done, the facilitator asks if anyone wants to contribute any other ideas, positions, stances, etc, now or be silent forever.Most of the times everybody has already given their different perspectives.But sometimes, when the facilitator reminds everybody that there are no bad ideas. People will add positions or views which they did not have want to share earlier because they thought that they could not get the argumentation right.Remind people that no idea or topic is ever invaluable in a meeting.What often happens in deep democracy that a unique idea, will be defended by someone other as the one who inserted it in the group.Therefore the facilitator must assure that people share an opinion even if they have not yet the resources or facts to back up the claim.Then vote by hands and you continue to the next topic.Some NotesThe topic list is not made to be finished at the end of the meeting, although it can be finished in a meeting.It has the function to constantly prioritize the topic talked about. The result that fewer ‚Äòunproductive‚Äô topics are discussed.The engagement will increase significantly with a large group as people will put their objectives on the table.Therefore people will feel more fulfilled, and meetings become an interesting place where you can never get bored.For delegation, the secretary has kept a to-do list. Before assuming that certain people like to do a task because they are the best suited for it.Ask the people what they like to do. Often there will be unexpected collaborations of which the team performance will benefit a lot.The facilitator finishes up the meeting with the planning for the next meeting, minimizing the effort to reach everyone individually to see if they have time in their agenda.The checkout is not mandatory.But if you start implementing this system it is a good idea to reflect on topics like open space, non-violent communication, effectiveness and efficiency, and role interaction.This shows the results for the non-believers.The facilitator is the one person accountable for collective behavior.Therefore when an interruption occurs:When such interruptions happen the facilitator has to make a judgment call.Is the group in the danger zone of only using words that do no longer correspond to the topic. But instead, communicate indirectly about concepts that belong to the realm of the subconscious.Or was it just an insubstantial sidetrack, which can be moved back to the topic by saying something like.Did you mean, ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶, in accordance with the topic?Or could you elaborate on the connection between what you are saying and the topic we are currently discussing?When the interruption endangers the collective group effort. The group has moved the conversation to the realm of the unconscious. In which they speak about concrete objects but are in facto referring to other more abstract concepts.The facilitator has to speak up and say I believe we are going into the danger zone.Often others in the group will agree that they do not know anymore what the others are talking about or that they feel that there is tension in the room.The facilitator has to ask the question.What is truly on your mind right now?Or what triggered that specific response in our conversation about this topic?My advice is to give people a breather for like two minutes before you do the inventory of people thoughts.When you have to resort as a facilitator by stepping in, we dive deep, hence the name Deep Democracy.Deep dives do not occur regularly but when they happen they have to be addressed immediately or the tension will spread like cancer throughout your team.For example, in a meeting about the educational program, the attendees felt unease about the increase in the prices and how the facts were presented to the public.After diving deep we found out that that was not the real problem.Some members of the other teams felt left out when the final decision was taken at the leadership level.Thus the problem was caused by tensions created between the idealism of volunteers and the organizational reality of the leadership.In order occasions, it is often a personal matter in which a certain individual unconsciously was hurting another person in the room or felt hurt, or judgment was accidentally presented as a fact, creating false assumptions.To conclude,The primary role of the facilitator is to asses in which dimension the conversation is taking place.In the realm of social dynamics, the facilitator has to determine if the conversation is a collective or between two individuals.Furthermore, the facilitator has to be on point what is shared publicly and what is withheld in the group unconscious.Some simple reminders:Disclaimer: This blog is a reflection of my experiences with deep democracy. It should have many parallels with the deep democracy training, but the ideas may deviate in some areas. As I would always say, experiment until you reach the right spot.",25/07/2019,1,0,20,10,,,16,8,0,63,82
Taking back control of your narrative,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/taking-back-control-of-your-narrative-595fe647cd2d,Jax Raw,21,4,773,"Mindset is everything in business and life. Everything in our lives is created first in our minds when we imagine a better life, a bigger career or what our passions could look like manifested and only once they‚Äôve incubated and grown stronger, do our ideas start to take shape in reality. It‚Äôs there, at the moment a new idea or ambition is born, that it is at its safest. It hasn‚Äôt yet been met with all the resistance, fear-mongering and negativity that new ideas are all faced with (usually created by ourselves).Entrepreneurs and professionals underestimate the importance of bringing their attitudes and inner monologues into submission.www.datadriveninvestor.comFear and doubt start their horrid onslaught almost as quickly as we dare venture into the unknown.Most often than not, would-be entrepreneurs never make it because their will to succeed is not stronger than the voices telling them not to try. Sadly, this is the rule and not the exception and most of us ‚Äî if not all of us ‚Äî face the same fears and doubts.We don‚Äôt have to succumb to the noise though. If we‚Äôre aware that the mental attacks will come and we prepare for them, then we‚Äôll be equipping ourselves with the best chances of succeeding.Here are the three practices that have worked for me. It‚Äôs taken some time to get to this point in my journey ‚Äî make no mistake ‚Äî and I am stronger and wiser for it. Implement these three strategies straight away to help you manage the anxieties, fears, and self-doubts that most certainly accompany taking on a new challenge.Your pain killer is your vision, or at the very least, the clearest picture you can define what success will look like and, more importantly, feel like for you. I can‚Äôt stress this point enough. If you‚Äôre trying to build something new whether it be a business, brand or product ‚Äî you will experience pain. The pain of sacrifice, rejection, sleep deprivation, failure, ridicule ‚Äî you name it, the pain will come. It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre faced with all of these obstacles that you need to draw on a powerful antidote, and that my friend, is your vision ‚Äî your why. If you‚Äôre clear around why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing or know exactly what your reward will be at the end of it all, you‚Äôll be less likely to throw in the towel when the going gets tough. Define your pain-killer. Just do it.So the thing to remember here is that we are all fundamentally programmed to keep ourselves safe. This means that our brains want us firmly rooted in what is familiar and predictable. Every time we want to venture beyond our brain‚Äôs known universe, it activates all its defense mechanisms in an attempt to keep you safe. Our inner voice starts to chime in‚Ä¶ What if you fail? What if you lose everything? What if they reject you? What if you try and you don‚Äôt ever make it the way you want to? What if they hate everything you have to say? The bull starts to flow and if we‚Äôre not careful, our brain will win and we will step back into the safety of the known and leave all the potential of the unknown, untapped. This is the battle all human beings face. We‚Äôre all hard-wired with the same defense mechanism and we all have the same ability to overcome it. The trick is to acknowledge that your fears are all true and valid and could happen for sure but then to get up and smash our goals anyway. Know your fears and do it anyway.Seriously. Way too many highly capable people with more potential than we could imagine, just don‚Äôt make it because they haven‚Äôt developed a healthy tolerance for rejection and failure. Both of which are absolute givens if you‚Äôre ever going to do anything that amounts to much. Accept unequivocally that you‚Äôre going to make mistakes. Just get over it. Nothing is lost if you learn from and grow through failure and rejection. More people must become more relentless. I think it boils down to whether we believe we‚Äôre worthy of the success we strive for ‚Äî but that‚Äôs an article for another day. Regardless of where our ability to so easily quit on ourselves comes from, we need to start permitting ourselves to go after what we want, go hard and make no apologies for dreaming big.Learn to become aware of the stories you‚Äôre telling yourself about the world and your place in it. These stories will either make you or break you ‚Äî depending on how involved you become in driving the narrative.",25/07/2019,0,0,0,0,875,346,2,0,0,2,72
How To Scale-up Your Startup Output: Tips for Entrepreneurs,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-to-scale-up-your-startup-output-tips-for-entrepreneurs-47c16020a67,Shakun Grover,29,5,1037,"Being a founder means you have multiple hats and you always working in a high-octane by managing a healthy environment. But it isn‚Äôt as easy as it seems to be, challenges to be a founder are coming up with compelling ideas, hiring talented staff, getting new clients. Instead, all this come down to one factor ‚Äî lack of time. It highly affects the entire output level of the company in a direct and indirect manner. The only thing in this world everyone is blessed with equality is time. Hence, entrepreneurs can enhance their productivity or output level by emphasizing on result-driven actions in order to get maximum in short time of span.As mentioned in the Startup Genome, approximately 74% of startups don‚Äôt succeed due to its premature scaling. Ironically, failed startups have often had a viable product and a wide range of loyal customers but also have troubling in scaling in the right way.www.datadriveninvestor.comIn this blog, we are going to uncover some critical factors which help entrepreneurs to scale-up the productivity or output level, as well as provide a path of a successful start-up.Identify milestones- The first and foremost way to raise the output of your organization is to find out milestones. ‚ÄúTo do this and do it well‚Äù ‚Äî signifies that linking the capital with each phase of the company‚Äôs growth. Begin with identifying the milestones where you need to hit and develop a timeline for when you need to hit them. It enables to provide a fully budgeted roadmap so as to moving forward and allow entrepreneurs to plan the sources of fundraising. Instead of speaking with board members or investors, focus on those working arrears which consume more time and cost.Automate everything- In this digital era, entrepreneurs need to upgrade their organizational processes and it facilitates in finding out the best solution of problems. Being an entrepreneur, you need to set up cloud storage that contains all your organization‚Äôs data and information as well as allow employees to reach easily. Set up a virtual training system for new and existing hires where can learn while working, it reduces training costs and makes things happen in a certain time period. Along with this, it also enables entrepreneurs to reach their target audiences and recognize their needs or wants.Implement a continuous improvement approach- Improvising productivity is an ongoing activity, so as an entrepreneur you always have an effective improvement. To develop this, you can start with assessing the competition and best practices of industry; but don‚Äôt copy the plans of others‚Äô formulate a one which one is suitable for your organization. Apart from this, take external help to assess business‚Äôs strength and weakness, it provides you certain priorities will be taken into consideration to get better results. Hence, a good improvement approach enables a startup to generate higher productivity and proficiency as well as minimize errors which automatically contributes to the rising output level.Find your ideal customers ‚Äî Identifying your ideal customer will take time. But this step and its inevitable mistakes help to your business towards sustainable growth and devoted customers. Yes, having ideal customers‚Äô is also an effective way to scale-up the output level of the company because if employees know to whom they have to produce. I think they will produce in a more efficient and better way. But, ensure that not to sell in too many different groups. Along with this, you should be clear when communicating your business benefits to your buyer. Make them concise, attention-grabbing, and differentiated from your competitors.Read More ‚Äî Why startups fail in India due to lack of digital marketingIntroduce Training through Mentors- Hiring mentors who can provide training is the key to scaling up the output level of startup businesses. Invest in your team by rendering them training and development sessions can act as a fuel to drive the performance level of your organization. Although, before hiring a mentor you should involve to address team weaknesses thus to work on them effectively. Also remember that as long as you will invest in employees, the greater the chances of improving the quality of work. By holding training sessions, you can also develop extra skills within the team that would pay-off in the long-run.Practice Positive Reinforcement- Motivate, encourage and reward. Tell and appreciate employees that they are doing well and give constructive criticism. Most important, set personal incentives for doing the job well, like ‚Äî they could get a free holiday or free coffee or lunch takeout to perform above or beyond their roles. You should clearly indicate the success of one employee to others nurture a way of fulfillment for encouraging them. While you encourage your staff to work harder to receive rewards reciprocally, they‚Äôre more likely to put increased productivity high up on their to-do list. Hence, having a positive reinforce also make employees able to perform in the required manner, it results in fewer errors and higher motivation within staff members.Ensure Employees Are Happy- The last but not the least way of increasing the output level of employees is to make sure that employees are happy and satisfied with their job. A stressful working environment will not yield results. Sometimes, workers operate under high-stress conditions and found to be less productive. It results, the higher level of absenteeism and disengagement‚Ä¶. They need to be happy. All you can do, showing them company values them, appreciate their efforts on a personal and professional level from time to time is gratifying- and often overlooked.Therefore, as a founder of the startup all you need is to emphasis on your business as soon as you‚Äôre planning for pursuing startup idea. Without scaling, you may end up with winding up the business and giving the edge to competitors to take your place in the market.Scalability is a mindset too; make sure that you have the right processes and system, plans and people to achieve end goals. As an entrepreneur, it is also essential to think big to become big. Having a good scalability and output level represents that the founders are free to unleash their dreams and generate higher profitability. Once you get your mind in the game, scalability becomes way easier.What have you done to create a scalable business?",25/07/2019,0,0,10,0,804,437,3,0,0,4,62
Feedback Timeliness,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/feedback-timeliness-f4be7bd1c719,Aviv Ben-Yosef,1000,3,163,"Every competent software engineering practitioner knows that short feedback loops are invaluable. As disciples of Kent Beck, we were taught early on that the sooner you realize that you have an issue, or that the API you‚Äôre working on is going to be hard to use or maintain, the lower the cost. This concept seems obvious, right?However, when it comes to helping their teams grow, too often leaders default to providing the feedback at wrong times.

For some of us, it‚Äôs the perfect hobby to express ourselves and our creativity. For others, however, it‚Äôs the perfect trap of both time and effort that could be better spent elsewhere.I‚Äôve written previously about the intrinsic value of our written words, about what successful writing really means and about how Medium is slowly but surely crumbling under the weight of its own ambitious venturing.Ask yourself: What would happen if Medium suddenly dropped off the map?Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî I like Medium and wholly believe that the world is a better place with Medium in it. I think it‚Äôs a brilliant platform for people to express their creativity and, despite it‚Äôs increasing flaws and degrading standards, it‚Äôs still a better place to spend time than most (if not all) other social networks. [Please don‚Äôt suspend me again].It‚Äôs also a great platform for certain publications to promote their respective enterprises and cultivate talented writership as well as niche readership.But, while Medium is a great stepping stone and host for uniting like-minded voices, its prospect for individual growth is rather stagnant. It‚Äôs individual development (tangible, rather than skillful) that I see as being potentially jeopardized by Medium, which takes the valuable content we create and, truth be told, doesn‚Äôt really do all that much with it.‚ÄúThe will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential‚Ä¶ these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.‚Äù ‚Äî ConfuciusAnd, to concede, Medium doesn‚Äôt exactly owe us anything. It does enough for us as it is. If we ever feel like the potential resting behind our content is never maximized, well, that‚Äôs ultimately on us.As for me, I‚Äôm one month shy of my first year anniversary on Medium. In this time, I‚Äôve published 148 (non-duplicate) articles. Not counting my month of inactive punishment, that amounts to almost 15 articles a month ‚Äî that‚Äôs almost 4 posts a week. With an average size of 1000 words per post, that‚Äôs a hefty bit of writing I‚Äôve doled out.You could say I‚Äôve written enough words to put together a 700-word book.So what‚Äôs wrong with this picture? It really depends on how we value our time. If we truly see writing on Medium as a hobby with nothing to really gain or lose, then that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî congratulations, you need not worry.The issue is that, until my month-long time out, I perceived it this way too.I figured it was better than playing video games, diving deeper into Netflix, and twiddling my thumbs with nothing to do. Hell ‚Äî a hobby that develops my writing ability (which it most certainly did), builds me a portfolio, helps me philosophize and pays off my car ‚Äî what‚Äôs there to lose?It turns out there was something to, maybe not lose, but at least jeopardize: my potential.‚ÄúNever underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this notion: The potential for greatness lives within each of us‚Äù ‚Äî Wilma RudolphLooking back, I wouldn‚Äôt do things differently. Over half of the content I‚Äôve posted here is going to be recycled into a book about philosophy which I‚Äôm now half-finished. I‚Äôm also happy to take my previously earned cash and count my blessings, even thank Medium for the opportunity.But this time off has revealed to me that it‚Äôs maybe not as fulfilling to spend so much time and energy in this loop of content creation, time and energy that can otherwise be spent building a better foundation for oneself.Because I‚Äôd like to think that most writers on Medium are like me, or had been like me at some point. Not just writing for the sake of writing but also self-improving in one form or another. Laying somewhat of a foundation; building up skill; evolving as a human being.‚ÄúOnce writing has become your major vice and greatest pleasure, only death can stop it.‚Äù ‚Äî Ernest HemingwaySo, if any writers are reading this ‚Äî I implore you to step back for a moment and just consider how you‚Äôre spending your time. If you‚Äôre fine with putting in as many hours as you are on Medium and aren‚Äôt looking to branch out, that‚Äôs fine and well. But is there some way that you can begin to build a foundation for another project or do more with the content you‚Äôre creating here?Because, really, it always boils down to content. Content is what drives Medium. Content is why we‚Äôre here. And so we must ask: with this content that we create ‚Äî are we able to make it more efficient for us? Maybe we can use it to market our businesses, maybe we can recycle it somehow, perhaps we can use it to further connect with others or begin to build a brand or an understanding.I know I‚Äôve used it myself to understand philosophical concepts, to inspire others, to build my own portfolio and develop myself. I know many of us already use it this way but, unfortunately, many of us get trapped trying to just write whatever gets more claps and, before we know it, months pass by and we‚Äôre drained, having possibly grown stagnant, or finding that we‚Äôre just writing for the sake of routine.It‚Äôs about evolution, self-progression, and self-worth. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs simply worth taking a deeper look. For it may be that the content we create here and avidly share amongst our readership is able to permeate and grow into something new altogether and we should ultimately maintain this awareness of the need to keep growing.Read On: Biting The Hand That Feeds: Is The Window Closing On Medium?",25/07/2019,0,0,3,1,816,352,3,0,0,8,37
Warren Buffett About To Give Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency A Chance?,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/warren-buffett-about-to-give-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-a-chance-317286237c72,Marco nicolo,15,3,449,"Every year, Warren Buffett auctions off a three-hour lunch date to benefit Glide, a San Francisco charity that fights homelessness and addiction. This year, he‚Äôll be having lunch with 28-year-old Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform Tron and CEO of BitTorrent. There is high anticipation on the upcoming Crypto Power Lunch between Billionaire and bitcoin skeptic Warren Buffett and Tron‚Äôs CEO, Justin Sun along with Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire. Sun invited Allaire to his lunch on Twitter, and Allaire cheerfully accepted. ‚ÄúHi Justin, I would be honored to join you and Warren Buffett next week to discuss crypto!! Count me in.

That‚Äôs a new record by a wide margin‚Äìlast year‚Äôs lunch went for about $3.3 million. Many are questioning, though, whether the lunch will be worth its price tag since Sun is clearly committed to Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry, for which Buffett has shown nothing but disdain.One Twitter user suggested that Sun ask Buffett if he regrets not having invested early on in Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Facebook. He says Buffett might regret missing out on the same early-stage tech opportunity if he doesn‚Äôt invest in bitcoin and cryptocurrency now when the industry is still in its infancy.But Sun also has a bigger, and perhaps more attainable goal. He told CNBC, he wants to become a bridge between the world of cryptocurrency and institutional investors. That‚Äôs what makes Sun‚Äôs record-setting bid look like a smart move. Whether he changes Buffett‚Äôs mind or not, the lunch will give Sun the kind of high profile, and greater legitimacy, than he could have gotten any other way, for any amount. Look at it that way, and the almost $4.6 million he‚Äôs promised to pay might actually be a bargain.Recently, the lunch has had to be rescheduled due to Justin Sun‚Äôs health issues, regarding his kidney stones as announced on 19th July 2019. The Lunch is still going to take place but the exact details of the date are yet to be confirmed. Could Sun move the stock market mogul to reconsider cryptocurrency?

One cannot deny the fact that the market has already witnessed not only brutal scams but also anti opinions on the entire crypto market.Anonymity on crypto platforms is one such issue that needs the major attention of the masses. Speaking of which Bill Gates said last year:www.datadriveninvestor.comThe anonymity of cryptos is not at all a good thing. The government‚Äôs ability to be able to trace money launderers as well as terrorist fundings is a good factor.

Keeping this in mind, International Distributed Ethereum Exchange (IDEX), recently announced that anonymity on its platform will no longer be tolerated.As per the announcements of the firm, the entire process of mandatory user verification is about to start from 24th July.Since IDEX has already announced the battle against Anonymity, it now ensures that they win it.Defeating such an issue might seem to be an enormously tough challenge and it seems IDEX is quite ready for it too.THE TWO LEVELS OF VERIFICATIONIn order to ensure that the entire agenda of defeating anonymity works as expected, the firm came up with two levels of the verification process.Moreover, IDEX also announced that access to certain assets will be restricted for users from the United States.

7 Reasons To Learn Go Language,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/7-reasons-to-learn-go-language-403686fe6859,myTectra,225,6,977,"Before Understanding, why to Learn Go Programming Language we need to know what is Go Programming Language..?Following are Different Names used for Go Programming Language:www.datadriveninvestor.com‚ÄúGo‚Äù, ‚ÄúGo Programming Language‚Äù, ‚ÄúGoLang‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGoogle Go‚Äù.Preface:GoLang is Designed and Supported at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson: To support scalability and effectiveness as they have the largest Clouding infrastructures. The language was announced in November 2009.‚ÄúGo‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoLang‚Äù is a Programming language with the developers working speed of dynamic languages like Python and benefits of performance and safety of a compiled language like C or C++Go Programming Language is a fast, statically typed; Compiled Programming Language. That Feels like Dynamically typed interpreted Language.Go Programming Language is Open Source (source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.), expressive (effectively conveying thought), concise (brief but comprehensive), clean (general-purpose purely functional), and efficient (Maximum Production with minimum Effort). Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.Versions of Go Language are as follows: Go Language Has Proved its stability from initial public release 1.0, back in the year 2012 to Till Now.Main 7 Reasons to learn Go Programming Language are:1. Go Language Programming Code Is very easy to handle and Maintain:Go Have very neat and Clean Programming syntax which are easy to understand. Go is Very Different Compared to Other Languages. Go is efficient as C/C++, writing code is as easy as Ruby/PythonThese are some of the features which GoLang Does not include:2. Go Programming Language is Powerful :To work and Get advantage of today‚Äôs and upcoming multiprocessors, Executing Programs at the same time is the biggest Challenge every modern application faces.Go programming language had adopted communicating sequential processes (CSP) model (aka the Actor Model) that‚Äôs been used successfully by Erlang. Go combines light-weight green threads (called goroutines) with communication pipelines called channels to form a simple, powerful concurrency model. This allows an application to run with thousands of actors, without the burden of trying to keep shared memory free from corruption.Being a Programmer you should always knowWhat is the hardware?What is software?What is programming, coding, scripting?What is threading?To understand the concept of goroutines, you should know all the above.Due to hardware limitations, the working speed is always affected to overcome this go had goroutines. Go is developed when multi-core processors were already available. Go has goroutines instead of threads3. Go Programming Language have Focused vocabulary:Many languages have numerous keywords that a developer must remember. Several of these keywords are designed to support programming concepts that have been around for decades. With Go, many of these concepts have been condensed as much as possible to reduce the number of keywords required. As a result, Go currently has around 25 keywords, as opposed to 50 or more for languages like Java and C#.4. Go Programming Language has Simple scoping rules:Many languages offer developers great flexibility to ensure that variables and functions can be hidden from other parts of the codebase. Go has only three levels of scoping and very simpleConventions for determining scope:There‚Äôs no ‚Äúprivate‚Äù scope, as you might have expected, which is enough to make some developers uncomfortable. But in practice, this opens up a lot of opportunities.5. Go Programming language has Built-in garbage collection:Garbage collection is a difficult problem to solve. However, manual memory management often incurs a fairly high cost on the developer and makes it more difficult to write error-free code. This is why the developers of Go made it a requirement to have it in the language. Initially, the garbage collector could take a heavy toll on an application in terms of performance. However, the cost of garbage collection is falling rapidly thanks to the determined effort.6. Go Programming Language have First-class functions:When object-oriented language dominated the software development landscape, the lowly function was largely relegated to being defined in the context of a class. With the discovery that first-class functions were one of JavaScript‚Äôs good parts, many languages have worked to restore functions to the first-class status. Go absorbed this lesson and allows functions to be created and passed around the application. That doesn‚Äôt mean that it has abandoned object-orientation; rather, it blends the best aspects of functional programming and object-oriented styles to provide greater flexibility with as little ceremony as possible.7. Go Programming Language have Batteries included:To create modern applications, you need more than just a great language. Modern applications rely on testing to ensure correctness, documentation generators to communicate how the application works, and linter to ensure that coding standards are adhered to. Go embraces each of these issues as core concerns of the language, not simply an add-on to be dealt with by another team. As a result, installing the Go development tools provides instant access to all of these capabilities and a guarantee that they‚Äôll work together without having to fight just to get everything working.The Countries like India, united states united Kingdom, Australia, Asia, Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Canada, China , Colombia, Denmark France Germany Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iran, Island, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Middle East, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Spain, Turkey, Thailand many More are Using Go Programming Languages.Famous Companies like Google, Dropbox, Soundcloud, Docker, BBC, Dell, eBay, Facebook, IBM, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo, Yandex are already using Go language/ GoLang.Conclusion:Here we understand what is Go Language Programming? What are the versions of Go Programming Language? And Reason to Learn Go Programming Language?Go programming language provides high performance like C/C++, super-efficient concurrency handling like Java and fun to code like Python/Perl.Being a Software developer you would always experience the hardware limitation putting pressure upon you. It is always been an important Concern to understand the limitation of the hardware and accordingly optimize our code.Go is a New language with Better Future, Never to forget the fact is that it‚Äôs developed at Google.Originally published at https://www.mytectra.com.",25/07/2019,0,0,10,6,787,543,4,3,0,3,1

Your Marketing Works Best When It‚Äôs Simple,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-your-marketing-works-best-when-its-simple-2024d7961285,Tom Stevenson,10700,4,781,"If you saw a child holding a sign by the side of the road saying ‚ÄòIce Cold Beer,‚Äô alarm bells would start ringing in your head.Why is this child selling beer?Do his parents know he is selling beer by the side of the road?Don‚Äôt children normally sell lemonade?It‚Äôs a natural reaction to a situation we‚Äòre unaccustomed to ‚Äî and it‚Äôs exactly what happened the other day in Utah. People driving by a local church in Brigham City were confronted with young Seth Parker, offering beer.Naturally, those who passed Seth were a little concerned and, after a few phone calls, the police arrived on the scene to see what was going on.This is when things took an interesting twist.Seth was indeed selling beer, but it turns out it wasn‚Äôt your regular stone-cold beer. No sir, he was selling root beer instead, which was non-alcoholic.Seth had included the word ‚Äúroot‚Äù on his sign but in tiny letters. Driving past you would have never seen it!Through this excellent marketing strategy, Seth drummed up solid business that day, selling out of his root beer, and creating headlines in news outlets across the United States.His marketing strategy was beautifully simple and easy to deploy. He played on people‚Äôs love for beer, using it to his own advantage. Was it manipulative? Almost certainly, but most marketing is to an extent.The real question is: what can we learn from Seth‚Äôs marketing strategy that we can apply to our own businesses?There was no money behind Seth‚Äôs strategy. He had his stand, a sign, and that was it. His strategy was about as simple as it can be. He didn‚Äôt need it to be any more complicated.The message was his kicker, the ace up his sleeve. Most of us driving by on a hot summer‚Äôs day would instantly notice this sign. Who doesn‚Äôt love a cold beer when the weather is roasting?The advantage Seth had was that he was a child. The sign would have grabbed our attention, but seeing who was behind it, would cause us to do a double-take.We‚Äôd be much more likely to stop and check out what‚Äôs going on when we see something that doesn‚Äôt tally with what we‚Äôre used to.On getting closer, we would have seen ‚Äúroot‚Äù in small letters and instantly admired the young lad for his clever marketing trick, making a sale more likely. After all, who doesn‚Äôt admire a plucky kid like Seth trying to make a bit of money?We can agonise for hours and hours over what marketing strategies to adopt, but sometimes the simplest methods work the best.Business is tough. There is a lot of competition no matter what field you are in. Sticking out in a crowded market isn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî you have to think of ways to get heard above the constant noise.We are exposed to numerous marketing strategies every day ‚Äî most of them we block out, we have become so accustomed to seeing them.If I asked you to remember the last time an advert or a poster grabbed your attention, I suspect you‚Äôd struggle to remember when it was. I know I would!To stand out you have to do something different ‚Äî grab people‚Äôs attention; give them something they won‚Äôt forget in a hurry.Apple‚Äôs famous 1984 commercial is one example:The fact that it is still being referred to today, tells you all you need to know about how effective it was. The majority of adverts do not make anywhere near the impression that Apple‚Äôs did.When it comes to marketing you have to think of ways that will make you stand out from the crowd. Ways that will make people remember your brand and want to buy your products.Our attention spans are only getting shorter. To capture them, you have to do something unusual, that we are unaccustomed to seeing.We can learn a lot from Seth. Simplicity and intrigue were a key part of his strategy: they got the desired results and then some.He didn‚Äôt intend to go viral, but he did. So much so, that I have written an article extolling the genius of his homemade beer sign!If we can learn anything from Seth selling his root beer by the side of the road, it‚Äôs that we‚Äôre all open to manipulation. All it took was a cleverly designed sign to drive a ton of attention and business.None of us likes to be manipulated, but when we‚Äôve been cleverly tricked in a way that is not too deceitful, we tend to applaud the audacity of the person behind the trick.Marketing is a form of manipulation in most cases. Just make sure you don‚Äôt stray too far and you might have the same success that Seth did too!",25/07/2019,4,0,0,5,1050,700,1,0,0,3,434
Accomplishing More Won‚Äôt Make You Happier,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/accomplishing-more-wont-make-you-happier-5b04b8d1185d,"Melody Wilding, LMSW",69000,5,1051,"Do these sound like promises you‚Äôve made to yourself?In our goal-oriented society, setting an objective to work toward is often a powerful motivator that drives professional and personal progress.In theory, this may not sound like a bad thing, but what if when you achieve that goal, life doesn‚Äôt really look or feel any different? For example, have you ever completed one project only to realize that there‚Äôs now even more to do, meaning you‚Äôre further from the work-life balance you so desperately crave? Others may relate to the confusing feeling of finally getting or a raise or promotion, only to remain haunted by anxiety and a sneaking sense of disillusionment.This disconcerting letdown has a name. Commonly known as the arrival fallacy, it‚Äôs a psychological thought trap that high-achievers are all too familiar with.Here‚Äôs how the arrival fallacy works, along with what you can do to counteract it and reach new heights of success.The arrival fallacy‚Äìa term introduced by positive psychology expert Tal Ben-Shahar in his book Happier‚Äìoperates on the idea that in the process of working toward a goal, you come to expect that you will, in fact, reach it.Anchoring on a future goal triggers reward centers in the brain, inducing a cognitively soothing effect. That feeling of accomplishment becomes part of your day-to-day identity. You readily adjust to this new state of being, so much so that actually attaining a goal turns out to be less satisfying than expected.While dedication to continuous personal improvement is admirable, it‚Äôs a slippery slope. When we get too caught up in future outcomes, we may attach to an unattainable illusion of perfection. We seek goal after goal, hoping something will make us happy, which reinforces a cycle of self-doubt and not feeling ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù.Instead, it can develop into a cycle of searching for external things ‚Äî accomplishments or material objects ‚Äî to fulfill and complete us. There are always new goals to take the place of those that have already been fulfilled. We go for bigger clients, seek larger raises or want to lose 15 pounds instead of five. We keep upping the ante.Moreover, often when we reach the place we thought we‚Äôd be happy, there are new challenges and responsibilities to face. Getting a promotion may mean working longer hours, launching a side hustle involves constantly seeking new business, and losing weight may incite jealousy among co-workers or mean fewer happy hours and fancy lunches, straining your networking strategy.The arrival fallacy teaches us that, although you may fill your life with ever more ambitious goals and projects, reaching those heights does not necessarily deliver happiness. Yes, as clich√©d as it sounds, it‚Äôs the journey, not the destination that teaches lessons, reveals simple pleasures, brings new people into our lives and instills in us a genuine, internal sense of contentment.All this isn‚Äôt to say that setting goals or shooting for success in a particular area of your career is a recipe for unhappiness or failure, rather it‚Äôs how you allow that goal to dictate your daily mood that can bring you down.Striving for self-improvement is essential. Here‚Äôs how to do it in a healthy way that accelerates success.It can be easy to become so unshakably transfixed on achieving professional objectives such as banking a certain salary or earning a prestigious job title that your original purpose is forgotten. Mired in busywork and the daily ins and outs of your duties, you may lose sight of the bigger ‚Äúwhy‚Äù that drives you. Without a sense of purpose, you climb the ladder success with profound emptiness.When this happens, dedicate intentional time to re-orient back to your mission. Take a day or two to refocus. You don‚Äôt have to travel anywhere. You can simulate a professional mini-retreat by asking yourself big questions like ‚ÄúWhat would I be doing if money wasn‚Äôt a problem?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhen do I feel most alive?‚ÄùThrough this internal exploration, you may come to realize what you covet more than a promotion or raise is the opportunity to make a meaningful impact, lead a team or simply feel more validated and appreciated at work.In study after study, social scientists like Daniel Pink have found that external rewards and traditional financial incentives don‚Äôt improve employee performance. They may actually backfire, making it difficult for people to come up with creative solutions.Instead, research shows high achievement is the result of intrinsic drivers‚Äìthat is, a desire to do something for inherent interests, self-fulfillment or enjoyment. Motivation increases when people have the desire to perfect their craft. Successful people enjoy the learning process and don‚Äôt mind when it continues beyond an expected time frame. They relish the journey to mastery. They focus on the happiness cultivated along the path to a particular goal, and not necessarily the material outcome.Try savoring how satisfying closing a big sale feels, how deeply loved and seen you feel when family take note of your accomplishments or appreciate the increased recognition your company is receiving in the industry.Setting a big, hairy audacious goal‚Äìlike publishing a book or launching a startup‚Äìcan be a fantastic catalyst for change, but it‚Äôs not enough. You must commit to a process of taking action on a consistent basis.Start with the question, ‚ÄúWhat could I do daily that would guarantee a result and move me forward?‚Äù to design your habit system. If you‚Äôre an aspiring author, create a weekly writing schedule. If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, devise standard operating procedures to streamline your efforts. Whatever it is, it must be an action you can sustain over time.Understand that the metrics of success ‚Äî whether related to career, fitness, love, or whatever else ‚Äî are fluid and dynamic. There is always a higher rung in the ladder and over time your targets change. The ideal career when you‚Äôre in your 20s may be a poor work-life fit by the time you turn 35.Instead of prescribing to career milestones society dictates you should have reached by a certain age or salary bracket, keep your options open, define success on your own terms and embrace the many opportunities you encounter along the way.Rather than work to attain a ‚Äúcure-all‚Äù end goal, it‚Äôs important to view life as a succession of practices that build an imperfect, yet wonderful, big picture. Greatness comes from years of grit and effort, with many stumbles along the way.",25/07/2019,2,0,0,5,1050,700,1,1,0,7,559
Why Using an Instagram Engagement Bot Won‚Äôt Take You Anywhere,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-using-an-instagram-engagement-bot-wont-take-you-anywhere-b286e5ae1c98,Charles Tumiotto Jackson,1800,5,1177,"We‚Äôve all heard about these influencers that make a living through partnerships on Instagram. Or we‚Äôre impressed by these brands being able to gather a large community and then advertise their products for free, since they own the channel, on their Instagram page. These things make us feel so much jealousy. ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I do it?‚Äô you may be wondering.Making a living out of an Instagram account is so tempting and appealing. It seems way too easy, way too good to be true. But it is a real thing, and some people make a genuine income out of their account. That makes the competition on Instagram extra hard. So many people want to take advantage of that and want to start gathering communities to monetize their audience.While creating a community is a complicated and time-consuming job, most people remain certain that making a living out of their Instagram account is easy and happens overnight. Most people also tend to underestimate the skill set required to grow an Instagram account. ‚ÄòWhat, it takes more than a nice picture and a pun as a caption?‚Äô Yes, it does.The hunger for followers and easy money created a very high demand for tools that would automate your Instagram account to make it grow. And that‚Äôs what an engagement bot is: an automated tool that auto-likes pictures and follows, then unfollows, accounts within your niche to raise awareness on your profile and hope that these people will end up following you.In short: you pay a monthly fee, and a bot takes over your Instagram and makes sure that your number of followers is growing. All you have to do is post content every once in a while, and wait for 300 users to follow you per week. It sounds very appealing. Then why is it so controversial?They do. All you have to do is target accounts that are within your niche. Then the bot will go through the followers of these accounts and like their content, follow them, and so on. The bot will engage with the followers of a similar account to yours. The logic here is that, if they followed that other account in the same niche, they might follow you since you would have a close enough content.By engaging with these people, the bots make sure that people get curious and end up going to your profile, see that your content fits in their interests, so they end up subscribing.Because of the targeting and because a bot will engage 24/7 with other people, you can expect crazy results‚Äîup to 300 new followers per week.No wonder why using an engagement bot is not encouraged by Instagram. If you use an engagement bot, you are very unlikely to purchase ads within Instagram to boost your reach and visibility. Instagram is losing a ton of money because of these bots.When you start using a bot, you can expect considerable growth in your number of followers. There‚Äôs probably no other way, besides maybe going viral, to get that many followers in such a short amount of time. However, when you‚Äôre using a bot, your engagement rate seems to get lower. So what does that mean?If your engagement rate is getting lower as you‚Äôre getting new followers, that means that the amount of people engaging with your content remains roughly the same as before using the bot.This has a couple of consequences.Because not all your new followers engage with your content, your engagement rate gets lower (you‚Äôre getting more followers and roughly the same amount of engagement per post), and getting a lower engagement sends a signal to Instagram that your content might not be that interesting and relevant. Instagram in turn will tend not to prioritize your content on your followers‚Äô newsfeed, because content from other accounts would be perceived as more engaging and better quality. Because your content is not prioritized, it will be seen by fewer people. Which will result in a lower engagement rate.It‚Äôs a vicious circle. The more you‚Äôre using a bot, the more followers you have, and the less engagement you will get.Several reasons here. The simplest one is: if someone followed you because you engaged with their content, that could be because your bot liked their content, so they followed you hoping that you would follow back; or your bot followed them, so they‚Äôre just following back to make sure that you will not unfollow them two days later (which you will anyway). People will do anything for more followers.A less discussed reason is that maybe you targeted people that are also using engagement bots. That means that you are engaging with people that are already a low-quality audience: an audience that won‚Äôt engage with your content, an audience that follows you because you followed them or because they‚Äôre hoping for you to follow back.Since more and more accounts (and even big accounts) are relying on engagement bots to get followers, a significant part of the audience that you are gaining by using a bot yourself will not be engaged with your content, because what they‚Äôre looking for is not your brand or product‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for followers, just like you are!Absolutely not. Using an engagement bot slowly kills your account. It will make your engagement rate decrease progressively until your content is perceived as valueless by Instagram.The followers that you are getting using this method are, for the most part, lurkers that would do anything for one more follower. They won‚Äôt engage with your content, and they will surely never buy your products.An engagement bot can make you feel better: you see your Instagram account growing. You see so many new followers every day. It gives you the impression that your page is doing great; it gives you the feeling that you are building an audience. While in reality: you‚Äôre just making one metric higher, your number of followers. The number of engaged followers you have remains the same (and might decrease!).Using an engagement bots puts you in denial: you have the impression that you‚Äôre growing, but from a business perspective, your account remains at the same level. You will have the same amount of engaged followers as before. You will have the same amount of clients as before. You will have the same amount of DMs and comments as before.Engagement bots are a fantastic way for lazy and insecure people to make sure that there‚Äôs an activity on their Instagram profile. But these bots are just an illusion. If you want a good piece of advice: forget your ego for a second, and focus on these engaged followers, learn how to bring them value, engage with them back, figure out how to get more of those, and you will see growth on your account. But that growth will be sustainable and healthy.Do you feel like you tried everything to grow on Instagram? Hopefully, what follows will be the last thing you will have to do to reach your goals.Get the best Instagram Growth knowledge in your inbox & immediately download my Instagram cheat sheet for FREE.",25/07/2019,0,0,5,0,1050,700,1,0,0,3,345
You‚Äôll Never Feel Good Enough to Start Building an Audience,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/youll-never-feel-good-enough-to-start-building-an-audience-312eec971627,Zulie Rane,66000,5,1085,"I waited to start building my email subscriber list. I waited for eight months. Eight long moths before I felt comfortable enough with my voice, with the idea that I had things worth saying, that people wanted a way to stay in touch with me. Once I bit the bullet and did it, I waited before I started sending out weekly newsletters. I was afraid of scaring people off, of making them regret their choice.Finally, one inconspicuous day not too long ago, I sent off my very first newsletter, to all seventeen of my subscribers. Heart in throat, I scanned the newsletter one last time for typos, glaring errors, or contradictions, closed my eyes and hit send (then opened my eyes, realized I‚Äôd accidentally missed the button, and did it again with eyes open.)I had a lot of feelings about this. First of all, I was a little embarrassed to send out my thoughts and feelings in something as intimate as an email. It felt massively pretentious. Who really cared what I have to say? So much that they‚Äôd be interested in me sending out my Sunday thoughts? It felt like I was overvaluing myself.Plus, it felt silly that I was sending this broadcast out to only seventeen people. I understand the value of a thousands-strong email list, but in the teens? What‚Äôs the point? Why bother? What impact would it possibly have?I felt indecision. What should I put in the newsletter? What could interest people? What should the name be? When should I send it?But mostly, I felt regret. I never got around to starting my email list when I began writing on Medium, even though the very first voices that I heard on this platform told me to from day one. I always thought I was the exception, that I had valid reasons for not taking the jump. You know what the actual reason was?I was afraid.I‚Äôd only just started writing, I didn‚Äôt know the first thing about starting a mailing list, and even if I did, who would care what I had to say?I‚Äôll do it when I‚Äôm more established, I thought to myself.So I waited. And waited. And I waited some more. Somehow I just never had enough time, or it wasn‚Äôt quite the right moment, or I‚Äôd be in a better position later. I just wanted to focus on writing, on building it into a sustainable career. There‚Äôd be time for newsletters later.I‚Äôm way more ‚Äúestablished‚Äù than I ever thought I‚Äôd be, in terms of writing success. I know my way around a keyboard and I‚Äôve written more than I ever thought was possible.So I finally bit the bullet. I created a mailing list.And the lesson I learned was that the best time to have done this was eight months ago.I should have believed in myself from the start, believed that people would want to stay in touch with me and hear more from me. I shouldn‚Äôt have been afraid to run before I could walk, to commit to investing in myself.Eight months later, I am comfortable with writing, comfortable with my schedule, comfortable in my role here ‚Äî and I finally started creating my mailing list.If I took things one step at a time, I would save up enough money at my day job, then take a class in writing, then think of a brilliant book idea, and so on. I wouldn‚Äôt do what I‚Äôve done now: jump headfirst into the world of writing while holding down a day job and a separate side-gig. I was passionate about starting writing as soon as I could, so I made it work.I wish I‚Äôd taken the same approach to my mailing list. I wish I hadn‚Äôt hesitated, paralyzed by the need to get everything else perfect before I took that next step.Life passes us by while we‚Äôre busy putting one foot in front of the other. Sometimes, that‚Äôs the right approach. When you need to build a foundation of knowledge, or if you‚Äôre genuinely overworked, it makes sense to have a measured approach.But I should have realized that was not the right approach for me then.Luckily for me, even though the best day to start was eight months ago, the second-best time to start? It was as soon as I could. Which was, finally, eight months ago.Now I‚Äôm started, and while I‚Äôm battling other feelings, like the feeling that nobody cares what I have to say, or that it‚Äôs silly to have a newsletter when only seventeen people are signed up to it, I am no longer feeling like there‚Äôs something I should be doing now.Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî all that stuff appeals to me, and the idea that a newsletter might help me along the way of becoming a writer by trade is a very alluring one. But that‚Äôs not my primary reason for creating a newsletter.What I should have realized was that I have a lot to share when it comes to writing. As soon as I started writing stories about how I‚Äôd found success on this platform, or about the tools I use to make writing easier or more fun, or the things I wish I‚Äôd known when I started out, I realized I wanted to be able to share that information with as many people as possible.What I believe is that anyone who wants to write for a living absolutely can and should pursue that dream. It‚Äôs more possible now, in my opinion, than ever before. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving me to ask people to stay in touch. That‚Äôs the factor that motivates me to write the newsletter. And I wish I‚Äôd started sooner.Everyone reading this, if you have any aspiration of using communication in your side-gig, start building a newsletter. Don‚Äôt wait until you have an audience, don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôve thought of the perfect thing to say, don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre completely comfortable in your position ‚Äî do it now.You might feel silly.You might feel like there‚Äôs no point.You might feel like nobody cares what you have to say.On every count, I have to tell you that you‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs not silly to want to share your voice with a targeted audience. It‚Äôs not pointless to start small, today, in the hopes that tomorrow it‚Äôll be bigger. And despite my worst fears, I‚Äôve always found that what I say is important to some people. It‚Äôs just a matter of finding those people.Give yourself a chance, and start planning for the audience you‚Äôll have one day.",25/07/2019,7,0,1,8,1050,699,2,0,0,4,876
How Instagram Changes Our Perception of Reality,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/instagram-vs-reality-d0bd88032cb1,Cherry Rose,36,5,1035,"Everyone has Instagram.Well, maybe not everyone, but a lot of people do. According to the statistics, one billion people use Instagram each month, and 71% percent of those are under the age of 35. From this, we can conclude that a lot of people use Instagram, and most of them are young people. Young people are influential; they follow what they see other people doing, and a lot of what they see comes from Instagram. Inherently this isn‚Äôt bad, but when what‚Äôs being posted isn‚Äôt reality, things become a bit messy.The rise of ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù has greatly affected how people view reality through the lens of Instagram. Influencers are Instagram users who have an established audience and credibility and can persuade people to buy a brand or service through this audience. Having the ability to influence an audience is powerful, and this power has often been abused by influencers, as what they put out there typically is not reality.The trend of modifying one‚Äôs body through the use of apps or other photo editing tools has become increasingly popular. Instagram influencers can be seen with extremely small waists, perfect proportions, and flawless skin. This usually isn‚Äôt the reality, however, as when compared with real life, these people don‚Äôt look like this. People are people, and people have flaws. Editing these flaws out isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but when given an influential audience, it can become detrimental.When young people scroll through their Instagram feed and see seemingly perfect people, with perfect bodies and lives, they start to envy them. They want to be models; they want to have abs and 22-inch waists too. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt?So, they begin to emulate them. This pursuit is dangerous, as it has the potential to lead to eating disorders and other mental health issues. Rachel Cohen, a psychologist, published a study that observed the correlation between taking and editing pictures and body image. She found that the more selfies and pictures taken and edited of oneself, the more eating concerns and body dissatisfaction they experience.To fully understand just how thick a veil these Instagram influencers live behind, former social media model Essena O‚ÄôNeill spoke out about her experience on the platform. She went through her Instagram feed and edited the captions on her photos to reflect what was actually happening in the moment, and the reality was brutal.The edited captions revealed sad truths such as ‚Äúhardly eaten‚Äù and ‚Äúyelled at my little sister‚Äù to get the photo just right. Perhaps the hardest truth to swallow that O‚ÄôNeill repeats in her captions is that what she posted was not real and that social media is not real life. This is such a hard-hitting statement because it means the perfection we‚Äôre striving for‚Äîthe one we count calories for, isolate, and mutilate ourselves for‚Äîisn‚Äôt real. So why do we continue to do it?The truth is we‚Äôve raised our standards so high‚Äîso falsely high‚Äîthat anything below them is seen as imperfect, unworthy even. When everyone edits themselves and constructs their life as perfect online, those who don‚Äôt will seem inferior.This leads to a variety of problems such as self-esteem and confidence issues, and people begin to compare themselves to these false online personas. Even those who are seen as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù online suffer mental consequences because they live with the knowledge that they don‚Äôt really look like what they attempt to portray. They know they are deceiving everyone and could get called out for it at any time. Pick your poison; both are awful.The effects of social media and the standard young people are held to are prevalent. The suicide rate of women between the ages of 20 and 24 has doubled in the past decade, and the pressure to be perfect on social media may have contributed to that number. This pressure may seem as though it‚Äôs coming primarily from men, but that‚Äôs not the case. The sad truth is that the people who are most critical of women on social media tend to be other women. This Reddit post sums it up pretty well:It‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow, but it‚Äôs the truth. Women judge other women not because of how other women look but because of their own insecurities, and social media‚Äîspecifically Instagram‚Äîhas made this relatively easy. Men do it too, just generally not on social media.This behavior starts young. Even children in elementary school have iPhones and use social media. This is both good and bad. It‚Äôs bad because if used improperly, social media can cause some serious self-image issues in young kids. However, it‚Äôs good because if we can teach our children how to properly use these platforms while they‚Äôre still young, we can make a difference in how they view themselves and others online in the future.To catch toxic behavior online and nip it in the bud, there are a few things parents should do:Don‚Äôt stalk them and don‚Äôt make them feel as though their privacy is being invaded. Rather, ask what they‚Äôre posting, and try to gauge whether or not the way they present themselves online is appropriate. Make sure they know you trust them; if you feel you need to check out their page, do it, but do it respectfully.They watch what you say and do. Don‚Äôt be critical of yourself because then they‚Äôll start to be critical of themselves. Compliment them meaningfully, and never put them down about how they look.Be honest with them. Share your concerns, the dangers of having social media, and make sure they understand that the internet is a dangerous place. The truth may be harsh, but it‚Äôs important that they know and understand the potential consequences of what they put out into the world.We can‚Äôt change what‚Äôs already happened, but we can change the future. Influencers have the most power; they have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of followers. They can change how we perceive reality through social media, and people like Essena O‚ÄôNeill have used their influencer status to expose the truth. We need more O‚ÄôNeills, more people coming forward and being honest about the impact social media has had on them.It‚Äôs time to break the rose-colored glass that divides us and get real about what‚Äôs being posted online.",25/07/2019,1,0,2,1,751,397,3,0,0,5,106
What Freelancing Is Really Like,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-honest-truth-about-freelancing-bff5dbdb9bbb,Helen Jackson,232,12,2011,"Congratulations on making the big decision to start your freelancing career ‚Äî you‚Äôre set to join over two million freelancers in the UK alone.According to a study by the IPSE, freelancers contributed a whopping ¬£119 billion to the economy in 2016. That‚Äôs a rise of ¬£10 billion from the previous year ‚Äî impressive.Aside from contributing positively to the economy, freelancing gives you freedom like no other job. If you‚Äôre one of the lucky few with flexible working hours in a full-time job, that‚Äôs great, and I‚Äôm jealous. But, working for yourself brings with it the ultimate flexibility. You can work into the night if you want, or you can get up at the crack of dawn. It‚Äôs the job that fits around your lifestyle ‚Äî whatever that may be. Maybe you fancy travelling the world but still want to earn money ‚Äî the mobility of a laptop means anywhere can be your office.There are cons to working for yourself as a freelancer, obviously. For example, unless you bag some retainer clients, your income could be pretty sketchy. You‚Äôll also need to muster up some willpower and stop watching Netflix. Put the washing down and go back to your work!If you‚Äôre truly fed up with the 9‚Äì5 grind of the office-based job, the long work commute, and the office ‚Äòbantz,‚Äô freelancing could be the perfect option for you. You just have to work out if your pros outweigh your cons.According to a study by Kalido, there seem to be many reasons freelancers decide to follow the path to self-employment. ‚ÄòEarn more and improve quality of life‚Äô placed as the second-highest reason with 54% of the vote. I‚Äôm not sure if I understand why the highest-voted answer was to ‚Äòlearn new skills for a more secure future.‚Äô OK, you can learn new skills ‚Äî but, let‚Äôs be honest, you can learn new skills in any job. Do you necessarily have to take the leap into freelancing to widen your skillset? I‚Äôm not so sure‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you learn a lot of new skills, but they‚Äôre not always job-related. You learn about running a business, how to fill in a tax return, how to diplomatically but firmly ask why the hell invoices are late/not paid, and, of course, there‚Äôs winning and then onboarding new clients.It can be a minefield and very overwhelming. But, like everything, it gets easier with time.When you become a freelancer, it‚Äôs easy to get so absorbed in your new work-life that your continued development goes out the window. All you seem to do is chase your current clients for payments and chase new clients for new business. Before you know it, it‚Äôs late evening, and you‚Äôve barely eaten all day.I‚Äôve just started my second round of freelancing ‚Äî mainly because my first time I said ‚Äòyes‚Äô to all jobs from any client, even when I got bad vibes from them (I‚Äôm still owed money two years on). I felt I had to in order to earn money. Chandler from ‚Äú Friends‚Äù was right ‚Äî the fear gets to you once you‚Äôve quit your full-time job.I was miserable, stressed, I had slowly come to resent some of my clients, and the work I was doing wasn‚Äôt fulfilling in the slightest.Here are my top tips for new freelancers.You need to really weigh up the pros and cons of working for yourself. Are you someone who can work by themselves ‚Äî sometimes going a full day or multiple days not talking to anyone? I was warned it could get lonely, but I don‚Äôt actually feel lonely. I‚Äôm a chatty person ‚Äî anyone who has unfortunately sat next to me in any office space can attest to this. I still talk to people, and so far, I‚Äôve not missed the office chit-chat.I talk with people online and in cafes I work at. I also make sure to break some days up by meeting friends for lunch. Whatever gets you out of the house and working in a new environment ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just one day a week ‚Äî do it.Pick your favourite cafe with free WiFi and buy a drink. Sit and work for a few hours, and when you go back home, you‚Äôll feel refreshed.This was something I didn‚Äôt do a lot of my first time around. This time, I‚Äôve got a cushion behind me. Having money saved means you don‚Äôt make rash decisions when accepting work. I took shit from clients left, right, and centre last time, and I‚Äôm sure as hell not doing that again! If you struggle with saving money, I‚Äôve been using an app called Plum. It‚Äôs free, and I read all about it on Money Saving Expert, so it was trustworthy. Check it out.If you don‚Äôt know who you want to work with, how will you market yourself properly? I work with business owners, mainly in the B2B sector. I know their pain points and exactly how I can alleviate the issues they‚Äôre having. You need to outline something similar so you can focus your offering.First of all, you need to work out what you‚Äôre going to charge. Look and see what other freelancers are charging for similar services. Write into your terms and conditions that you have the right to change your pricing without prior notice. Then, if after a few months you think your pricing is too low or too high, you can adjust accordingly.If a client tries to ask you to complete work for a price you‚Äôre not comfortable with, just stay firm with your pricing. If they want to pay, they‚Äôll hire you. If not, they‚Äôll find someone else, and they weren‚Äôt for you anyway. As soon as someone repeatedly questions my pricing, it‚Äôs a red flag that they might not pay. So stay away from them and politely decline.A contract or at least an email chain is a must when working with a client. I use PandaDoc for sending professional proposals and contracts. This software enables me to track when a client has opened and read the document. I can also put an expiry date on the proposal, and it comes with e-sign signature built-in.You need to protect yourself and your earnings when freelancing. This means not holding back when it comes to chasing invoice payments and insuring your business. I‚Äôm insured with Policy Bee ‚Äî not only does insurance help keep you protected, but it‚Äôs also a sign to a client that you‚Äôre not a risk.I spoke with nine freelancers and asked them what they‚Äôve found are the pros and cons of working from home ‚Äî from napping to being able to watch the Tour de France, they‚Äôre very varied!https://shendersoncopywriter.com/The absolute best thing about working from home has to be the naps. Yes, you get a lunch break in an office, but you can‚Äôt really take a nap. Working from home, you can schedule in a refreshing nap to give you a boost for the afternoon. As a woman who has been through two pregnancies, I can testify that this is not something to be taken for granted.The worst thing about working from home? It has to be the endless opportunities for procrastination. You think you‚Äôll just hang the washing on the line before you get going and, before you know it you‚Äôve vacuumed the whole house, tidied the kids‚Äô rooms, and mowed the lawn. All the while thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just do this and then get started.‚Äùwww.emmajaynecreative.co.ukSo for me, the pros of working from home are the flexibility. Being able to take my daughter to and from school, not having to worry about getting time off for school plays or sports day ‚Äî I‚Äôm in control of my own diary.Also, it‚Äôs a major pro not having the daily commute, stuck in traffic for hours in the rush hour. Having my own business puts me in control of my own earnings ‚Äî I‚Äôm not working to pay for someone else‚Äôs luxury holiday ‚Äî I‚Äôm (hopefully!) working towards my own.The biggest con is that working on your own can get a bit lonely, so it‚Äôs vital to get out and about, maybe see it as a big reason to go to networking events and get to know and make connections with other business owners. It can be hard if you don‚Äôt have anyone to work with and bounce ideas off, and you do need to be quite disciplined to make sure you actually make time to do the work.Taking holidays or sick days becomes a bit tricky as a freelancer ‚Äî it takes careful planning and a bit of juggling to ensure you don‚Äôt let anyone down and always deliver, so it‚Äôs worth building in a couple of days leeway where you can. Lastly, you need to be on top of everything ‚Äî from any IT problems to finances and accounts (though of course, you can always source these out to a fellow business owner).Tom‚Äôs LinkedIn profilewww.leedsresearchstudio.co.ukwww.seopete.co.ukCommute. Travelling to and from an office eats into precious work and sleep time. I can get up at 8:59 a.m. and be at my desk ready for 9 a.m., although I‚Äôm always late!Comfort. I can work from my sofa or my garden when the weather is nice. A laptop helps with this, being able to move from one room to another helps with a change of scenery. Not many offices offer this.Focus. Colleagues can often be a distraction, telling you about their weekend (I didn‚Äôt ask!) or constantly asking for your input. At home, these distractions are limited, I can ignore calls and divert emails until I‚Äôm ready.Background noise. I find it easier to work with the TV or radio on in the background ‚Äî it‚Äôs quite hard to watch the Tour de France in an office while working.Cats. I have two cats, and they constantly crave attention. Anyone who has cats will be familiar with a cat‚Äôs bum in your face when you‚Äôre trying to write an email.Loneliness. Sometimes, it helps to have another human in the same room to socialise with. We are social animals so working alone can get boring after a while. I combat this by visiting cafes when I need human interaction.Familiar surroundings. Sometimes, it helps to have a separation between home and work. Home can remind you of relaxation and stop you from work. I try to stop this by having a home office, which I use purely for work hours.truffleshufflemedia.co.ukI get to spend more time with my family whether they want me to or not. You can work when you want, if I get up at 6 a.m. and want to work I can, or if I want the day off I can. I now don‚Äôt need to battle with anyone else in the supermarkets at the weekend, I can just do it in the day.It can be lonely at times, I do miss that office banter. I have put quite a bit of timber on since working from home ‚Äî the fridge and cupboards are too close. I also find myself getting distracted by doing things about the house, and if your internet goes down it‚Äôs up to you to fix it. I also work in the front room, so when it‚Äôs school holidays it can become more of a juggling act.Profoundry.cohttp://www.indeliblethink.co.uk/For me, working from home is all pros. I can work when I want, listen to the music I love, take a break 15 minutes into my day without being shouted at. It‚Äôs my day, my way.None. Sure, I could say having nobody to talk to, but my cactus does that, so I‚Äôm covered for conversation.www.bogdanniculescu.comYou‚Äôll notice that a lot of the same points come up ‚Äî loneliness and flexibility/freedom. I guess it all depends on which aspects of self-employment you value more.I know for me, self-employment has made me happier, more relaxed, and less stressed ‚Äî which has got to be a good thing! I like choosing which clients I work alongside and what days and times I work.I guess the big question for you is ‚Äî are you ready to start your freelancing journey?",25/07/2019,2,0,22,0,950,683,3,8,0,16,129
Why You‚Äôre Losing Instagram Followers and How To Fix It,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-youre-losing-instagram-followers-and-how-to-fix-it-3f51b9d88fee,Eduardo Morales,3300,13,2575,"Are you or someone you know suddenly losing a bunch of followers on Instagram? Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not the only one.It‚Äôs happening to you, and it‚Äôs happening to me (in May of 2019, my ceramics-based account, @potteryforall, went from gaining 6000+ followers per month to losing 1000+ followers per month). It‚Äôs also happening to many other people we know on Instagram. In fact, according to the Instagram influencer-focused platform Fohr, as of the last quarter of 2020 over half of all ‚Äúcontent creators‚Äù are now losing followers, not gaining them.What‚Äôs going on?Instagram doesn‚Äôt release in-app users stats, so there‚Äôs no way to know exactly. However, there are some clear, overarching trends in the way we use the app that can give us valuable insight into why so many of us are experiencing this downturn (check out my article about Is Instagram dying? to read a bit more about the topic).Before we begin, it‚Äôs worthwhile to point out that it‚Äôs very, very unlikely that Instagram changed something within the app with the aim of making accounts lose followers. In other words, Instagram (the company) isn‚Äôt doing this to you. Why is this important to talk about? Because many people who are losing followers have asked me, ‚ÄúIs Instagram hiding my account? Am I shadowbanned? Why is Instagram doing this?‚ÄùConsciously or not, many of us think the reason why we‚Äôre losing followers is because there‚Äôs a glitch or a ‚Äúflag‚Äù that Instagram has placed on our account. We think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing our content or our account to be undiscoverable to some of our users. In most cases, this is simply not true (if you don‚Äôt believe me, check if you‚Äôre shadowbanned and learn more about how the algorithm works so you can see it yourself). Instagram isn‚Äôt causing you to lose followers.The reality is, there‚Äôs no incentive for Instagram to intentionally change something in the app that causes users to lose followers. They‚Äôre an advertising platform. They make money by making sure you use Instagram more so they can sell your attention to advertisers. Gaining more followers and feeling positive about your account makes us all more likely to use Instagram, now and in the future. Changing the app so their users loose followers doesn‚Äôt make sense for their business model or the happiness of their users.So if Instagram isn‚Äôt causing this, what is? Here are the most likely reasons.Instagram has been around for almost 10 years (it launched in 2010). Its rate of growth has now plateaued in the USA ‚Äî approximately 65% of people under 34 already use it. Remember how you felt when you first got Instagram a few years back? Finding and following new and interesting accounts was exciting. Discovering new content and voices felt valuable.Do you still feel that way about your Instagram account? I know I definitely don‚Äôt, and many people who I‚Äôve spoken to don't either. After years of using the app, seeing so much content, and getting a bit jaded after understanding how using Instagram can negatively affect our mental health, it‚Äôs much less common to come across accounts or content you genuinely feel excited to follow.This means that many of us are following new accounts at a much slower pace than we did when we were relatively new to the app. This leads to less new followers for everyone.Another side effect of Instagram being around for so long is that, after using the app for several years, most people‚Äôs preferences about what content they want to see have changed. Because of this, more users are now unfollowing accounts they‚Äôve followed for a while. This results in more of us losing followers at a faster pace than ever before (if you want to learn what organic activities you can use to monetize your account on Instagram you can check out my Instagram Small Business Class)You don‚Äôt wear all the same clothes, think the same thoughts, or have the same tastes as you did a few years ago, do you? If your answer is no, then why would we expect people to follow the same accounts on Instagram over time? When we change, the content we want to consume also changes. When we no longer receive value from an account we followed three years ago, we unfollow it. It‚Äôs normal, and it‚Äôs happening now more than ever.If more people are following new accounts at a slower rate and unfollowing accounts at a higher rate, it‚Äôs inevitable that we will see an overall decline in the act of following.More unfollows + fewer follows = a higher percentage of us losing followers.The potential for earning money as an influencer or business on Instagram has been highly publicized for many years. Many kids in America want to be a Vlogger/YouTuber (which is pretty similar to Instagram influencer) when they grow up.What does this have to do with us losing followers? Because of its income-earning potential, there are now many more people trying to get paid as a content creator on Instagram. This means there are many more talented people vying for your audience's attention. Unless you create very unique content, you‚Äôre likely to lose followers to accounts that create content that‚Äôs similar to yours, but better.Don‚Äôt take it personally. It‚Äôs just what happens when there are a larger number of people competing for a limited resource (attention).Losing followers to people who are better at creating content is something that happens to all of us. It‚Äôs happening to me too. When I started five years ago, my account, @pinlord, was one of only a handful of enamel pin pages on Instagram. This lack of competition enabled me to grow by almost 7000+ new followers per month.Now, there are thousands of enamel-pin related accounts that create similar content, and some of them do it better than me. Because of this, more of my followers are unfollowing me in exchange for other pages that better fulfill their enamel pin content needs. It‚Äôs a normal part of the ever-increasing competition for attention on Instagram, and it has resulted in my account now losing around 300 followers per month.Unless you‚Äôre an influential voice in an unsaturated content niche, or you‚Äôre creating different and valuable content in your saturated niche, you‚Äôre likely going to continue losing more followers than you‚Äôll gain.The first three reasons stated above are large, overarching trends. They‚Äôre not likely to create a sudden and noticeable decline in followers like the one many people are experiencing. That‚Äôs why the most likely reason why many people saw a marked decline in followers recently is because Instagram is now seriously cracking down on interaction automation (bots).How do I know this? Because I know this industry. I‚Äôve been writing articles about how to automate Instagram interactions and the best and safest bots for years. Since May 2019, most automation services have stopped working because of the blocks Instagram has placed on automation.Instagram is also now deleting a much larger percentage of ‚Äúghost‚Äù accounts created by companies who sell followers for a fee (this is different than interaction automation). Because of this, a much smaller number of Instagram accounts are automating the act of following, a well-known and effective growth tactic. Plus, a much larger number of ‚Äúghost‚Äù accounts are being deleted. Since there were literally millions of Instagram accounts that used automation, as well as millions of ‚Äúghost‚Äù accounts, the crackdown that began in May is the most likely reason you saw a sudden steep decline in followers.This crackdown isn‚Äôt the main cause of your follower loss ‚Äî the other three reasons are. It‚Äôs just the most likely reason you began noticing a marked decline in followers now.There are a million other small forces that have caused this widespread loss in followers, but none of them are likely to be as influential as the three main user trends stated above. So now that you what they are, what can you do about it?There‚Äôs good news and bad news when it comes to what you can do to stop your decline in followers.The good news is that making a few changes to stop your follower loss is simple and achievable (more on that later). The bad news is that getting back to gaining new followers at the rate you did before is going to be very difficult.All of the underlying user behavior trends behind your initial follower loss are unlikely to change at any point in the future. In fact, they are only likely to become more exaggerated every day. There‚Äôs nothing you personally can do to make Instagram new and exciting. There‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop people from changing their tastes and unfollowing you. There‚Äôs also nothing you can do to make Instagram less competitive, and you can‚Äôt bring back automation or all of those ‚Äúghosts‚Äù accounts that followed you.Believing that Instagram is going to revert to how it used to be and that you‚Äôll start growing again out of the blue is an exercise in futility. In honor of our collective mental sanity, it‚Äôs time that we accept these changes and realize that Instagram is no longer what it used to be. We won‚Äôt grow as fast as we used to. Let‚Äôs stop expecting to because, for the most part, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.Be kind to yourself and change your expectations about how fast your Instagram will grow. In fact, it‚Äôs best if you expect your Instagram to keep losing followers! Given the circumstances, it might never grow again despite your best efforts. Unless you want to keep being frustrated and anxious about it, it‚Äôs best to just accept it. At the end of the day, it‚Äôll be OK. You were happy before Instagram existed and you‚Äôll continue to be after it‚Äôs gone.Although there‚Äôs nothing you can do about Instagram not being exciting anymore, a crackdown in automation, and changes in user behavior, there are still things you can do to grow an audience on Instagram. First, make sure that you‚Äôre following all of the Instagram best practices. They are:These are all tried and true growth strategies. I can guarantee they will help halt your follower loss if you execute them properly. If you‚Äôre not doing one or a handful of these activities, then there‚Äôs still something you can do to stop your follower decline.Once you‚Äôre executing all of the best practices at a high level, it‚Äôs time to work on improving your content. You want to become the best content creator in your niche.If you‚Äôre the best content creator in your niche, you have the highest probability of being the account chosen to be followed above all others in your niche. In other words, the better your content, the less likely someone is to unfollow you and follow someone creating similar content.Creating world-class, valuable content is really, really hard. Becoming the ‚Äúbest‚Äù content creator in a niche is easy to say, but it‚Äôs super difficult to do. There‚Äôs also no one-way approach to doing it because each niche and each audience is different.The simplest way to start walking the road towards improving your content is to systematically improve your engagement. That process is a bit too complex to explain in a short paragraph, but you can read my article about how to increase your Instagram engagement if you want to learn about the process. It‚Äôs simple and accessible enough for anyone to tackle.Another strategy to combat the fact that Instagram will continue to be highly competitive is to transition your content to an unsaturated niche. In other words, create content about a topic that not many people are creating content about. Or, frame your topic in a way that is truly unique.The goal here is avoiding competing with other content creators altogether. Is there anything you have knowledge about that other content creators don't? Do you have a particular point of view that others don‚Äôt? That‚Äôs a good place to start. The fewer people there are who can easily replicate what you do, the less likely it is that your audience will find someone else that provides what you do.This is why I don‚Äôt recommend trying to be the next big fashion or beauty influencer. Yes, it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs very unlikely that you‚Äôll be able to create more valuable content than the tens of millions of very talented and fashionable people that are already doing this on Instagram. The same applies to any other intensely popular niche. The more people you‚Äôre competing with, the less likely to you are to create different content. Even if you are different, the more likely it is that eventually, someone will create something more unique than you.You can gauge how saturated your niche is by seeing how many posts there are in your niche‚Äôs most popular hashtag. The more posts there are within that hashtag, the more saturated it‚Äôs likely to be.For example, I want to start a new Instagram account that will do well with the algorithm, but I‚Äôm not sure what topic I want to focus. Three topics that interest me are yoga, macrame, and cacao ceremonies (weird tastes, I know‚Ä¶).I search for the main hashtag in each of these categories, and I see that #yoga has over 51,000,000 posts, #macrame over 1,300,000 posts, and #cacaoceremony only slightly more than 14,000. As you can see, I‚Äôll have a much higher likelihood of being the most engaging account within the cacao ceremony category.Ultimately, the smartest strategy here is to create a unique content niche specific to you by framing your content around your life and your personality, not a particular topic. People can always replace one enamel pin page for another or one fashion blogger for another, but no one can replace you. If your audience follows you because they value you and whatever you‚Äôre sharing about your individual lifestyle, there‚Äôs simply no replacement for that. That makes you much less vulnerable to other content creators competing for your audience‚Äôs attention.That‚Äôs it! Those are the reasons why you‚Äôre losing followers, as well as the ways you can combat it. Don‚Äôt stress about it and get to work! Know that there‚Äôs nothing you can do about changing Instagram or the people who use it, but there‚Äôs definitely a lot you can do to improve your account.Execute the essentials at a high level, and improve your content to stand out in your niche. Or, try transitioning your content to a new, less saturated niche. It‚Äôs not easy, but in the end, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôll work. If it were easy, everyone would do it!By the way, if you want to learn more about how Instagram works, read these articles on how the Instagram algorithm works, how to make money on Instagram, why your Instagram account isn‚Äôt growing, how to create effective Instagram story ads, how to create a visually appealing Instagram grid, how to increase your Instagram engagement, how to create effective Instagram sponsored posts, how to check if you‚Äôre shadowbanned, how to create an Instagram repost account that makes money, how to monetize your Medium article, the best Instagram bots, how to automate an Instagram bot that isn‚Äôt spammy, how to increase your Instagram engagement rate, how to find the best times to post, as well as everything you need to know about TikTok Bots, how to find the most valuable Instagram influencers, how to measure what an influencer is worth, how to measure your influencer marketing ROI, and how to reach out to influencers.",25/07/2019,2,0,1,3,1041,755,8,1,0,50,681
How To Master Your Mobility in 15 Minutes a Day,Better Humans,https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-write-yourself-a-15-minute-mobility-prescription-c6c0067b926f,Keenan Eriksson,2600,40,7888,"Mobility is defined as the ability to move freely and easily without pain. Lack of mobility is when you are restricted either by stiffness or pain. Mobility is often associated with flexibility, but it differs in that flexibility is about a muscle‚Äôs ability to lengthen in a passive state. Mobility is about your full range of motion‚Äîthe ability of your body‚Äôs muscles, tendons, joints, and other components to move together actively and pain-free.Mobility is easy to take for granted ‚Äî until aging, bad habits, or injury cause you to have a lack of mobility.Fortunately, you can take action before that happens. But choosing the right habits to maintain your mobility involves more than just choosing a new exercise program.Despite all my varied training, including years of Tae-kwon-do and yoga, I couldn‚Äôt have made myself a mobility routine until very recently. Until that is, I read Dr. Starrett‚Äôs famous tome: How to Become a Supple Leopard.Dr. Kelly Starrett is a physical therapist famous in the CrossFit community for turning super-athletes into super-mobile super-athletes.A typical CrossFit-games competitor needs to be able to run, sprint, jump, lift, squat, swing, climb, throw, and swim, so it‚Äôs no surprise that mobility work would be so essential to them. However, it may also be the single greatest thing you can do for yourself, even if you‚Äôve never touched a barbell in your life.How effective are Kelly‚Äôs methods? Well, I‚Äôve been doing traditional mobility work in the form of 45-minute stretching sequences by Gymnastic Bodies by Olympic Gymnastic Coach Chris Somner.These routines are no joke, and I fully intend on continuing the program for months or even years.But one movement from Dr. Starrett‚Äôs book, in particular ‚Äî the plated ‚ÄúSuper Frog‚Äù with banded distraction ‚Äî opened up my hips more in 2 minutes than an entire month of hour-long gymnastic stretch routines did.This is because mobilizing goes beyond the static-style stretching most of us are used to. Instead of just sitting and reaching for your toes to elongate the muscle, Kelly‚Äôs techniques instead focus on identifying areas where you need work and then using a multitude of advanced methods to restore function.Now, Kelly‚Äôs book is big for a reason, and I strongly recommend taking the time to read it and practice it yourself. However, I understand that we don‚Äôt all have time to read 500-page mobility textbooks. So I‚Äôve taken the most important and useful info from the book and used it to create this article.Before we get into the how-to, let‚Äôs address why it matters‚Äîit‚Äôs not just for your movement. Most of us know mobility is important; what you may not realize is that the effects of poor mobility go far beyond restricted movement.Back pain is the number one cause of missed workdays in the U.S. and causes more disability than any of the other 291 conditions studied worldwide.Furthermore, over 7 million Americans are living with full knee and hip joint replacements, and the rate of these surgeries is both increasing and trending toward younger and younger ages.Yet very few of us, even athletes, prioritize proper and functional movement archetypes and mobility work that prevents or mitigates these issues.Chronic sitting leads to tightness in the muscles in our hips and lower abdominals, which contributes directly to low back pain. In turn, hunching and rounding of the shoulders, such as the position we often assume while leaning over a computer screen, contributes to kyphosis: a condition whereby the spine bends forward and can create back problems.It‚Äôs true that sometimes injury, restriction, and pain are not the result of poor movement patterns. Sometimes people experience pain as a result of pathology: a genetic or biological disease that creates pain through inflammation or structural changes. You can have a tumor that presses against a nerve in your back and causes back pain, for example. In this case, the cause is the tumor, not your poor mobility.Another cause of pain is a catastrophic injury. Things like jumping from a second-story balcony and wrenching your ankle when it lands on a broken terra-cotta pot (this is a personal story, FYI).However, according to Dr. Starrett, pathology and catastrophic injury only account for 2% of all movement-related issues. Everything else is a result of poor biomechanics and function ‚Äî which means that 98% of these issues can be prevented and addressed by learning proper movement and working on your mobility.It‚Äôs good to know, too, that even catastrophic injury and pathology can be remedied with mobility work. When I wrenched my ankle, as described earlier, the physical therapist didn‚Äôt tell me ‚ÄúOh, well, you didn‚Äôt get here because of poor movement habits, so don‚Äôt worry about working on mobility to heal.‚Äù No, they gave me a plethora of exercises to address the damaged tissues in my ankle.An estimated 20% of Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain. Mobility exercise isn‚Äôt always the solution, and poor mobility isn‚Äôt always the cause‚Äîbut it sure is a factor.I don‚Äôt know about you, but if I can avoid becoming part of that statistic, and I can make sure my body functions well throughout my life, I‚Äôm doing it.Midline stabilization is essentially a fancy term for posture, but there is an important clue about what posture really is in those words. Many of us walk around with compromised spinal mechanics, meaning that we put stress on the spine in a multitude of ways due to poor position and movement habits.Proper posture‚Äîor midline stabilization‚Äîinvolves stabilizing the spine into a neutral position, hence the name: midline stabilization.Learning midline stabilization has a two-fold benefit. Not only is it essential for efficiency and power as a default position, but it also gives you a way to optimize your movement habits throughout the day.The first step is learning what a stabilized midline looks and feels like, then applying it to standing, walking, sitting, and pretty much any position where it is possible to do so.The Bracing Sequence is your all-purpose tool for fixing bad posture habits and creating a default position to use as a starting point. This sequence, found on page 40 of How To Become A Supple Leopard, is a 5-step process for aligning your spine in a neutral position.Start: Begin by standing up just as you normally would if you were not thinking about your posture. Perhaps your feet are a bit turned out, and your shoulders are rounded forward. Your lower back is overextended and your core is loose.Step 1: We start from the ground up. Step 1 of the bracing sequence is to get your feet aligned. Position your feet underneath your hips, facing forward and parallel. Your big toes should both point straight ahead and not away from each other.Now create tension by screwing your feet outward into the ground. Don‚Äôt actually move your feet, just create torque by screwing them into the ground.A good way to think about this is that your kneecaps will point slightly out towards the corners of the room.Just create a slight tension to stabilize your legs.Step 2: Squeeze your butt as though holding a penny between your cheeks. This sets your pelvis into a neutral position.This step can be done concurrently with step one as you screw your feet into the ground.Step 3: It is difficult and not ideal to walk around while squeezing your butt, so to set the pelvis into neutral, take a large breath in using your diaphragm.Step 4: Position your ribcage over your pelvis as you exhale, and engage your abs. Don‚Äôt hollow out your belly ‚Äî just engage your abs. The idea is to keep your pelvis set in the right position, without having to keep ‚Äúclenching the penny‚Äù. Maintaining your abs at about 20% engagement will keep your midline stable without the need to keep flexing your buttocks.Step 5: Externally rotate your shoulders and set the heads of your arms (the shoulder joint) back, spreading your collarbones. Do this by bringing your arms forward, then rotating them so that your palms face the sky and your shoulders rotate back.Simultaneously, position your head over your externally rotated shoulders. Your ears should be positioned over your shoulders, which are over your hips that are over your midfoot.Be careful not to disengage your core or extend your back as you rotate your shoulders.Finish: Finish out the sequence by letting your arms drop to your sides with your thumbs facing forward and shoulders externally rotated.Again, in this position, there should be a straight line of alignment of your ears over your shoulders, ribcage over the pelvis/hips, and hips over the midfoot.Generally speaking, it is difficult to maintain any static position for more than 20 minutes, so you will not remain braced all the time. However, the point is to make a habit of going through the bracing sequence as much as possible, so that good posture becomes the norm and not the exception.Prescription 1: Practice makes permanentPractice the bracing sequence for 5 minutes. Seriously, set a timer right now, and practice the sequence for 5 minutes.Aim to do this sequence frequently throughout the day to reset your posture. Standing in the grocery line? Go through the bracing sequence. Talking with friends? Do the sequence.This will help you have a more neutral spine and create a stable default position.The next step is learning to optimize your sitting. If you‚Äôre like me, you spend 4 hours or more sitting in a chair per day. I wrote about the dangers of sitting in more detail in Solving Sitting: A Guide to Optimizing Your Movement for Health, Longevity, & Performance. However, in short, sitting compromises health as much or more than smoking does.Surprisingly, a NASA scientist named Dr. Joan Vernikos discovered that you can counteract these negative health effects merely by standing up every 20 to 30 minutes.We‚Äôre going to take it a step further and optimize your posture at the same time.Prescription 2: Brace when you sitBefore sitting down, go through the bracing sequence. As you finish, sit down by hinging at the knees and hips as if you are doing a squat, while maintaining a neutral spine by keeping your shoulders back and your core engaged.Sit on the edge of the chair with your knees at a right angle. If you need to lean over, such as to type, hinge at your hip joint instead of slouching or bending your spine.Unless you are just a disciplined super-freak, you will not maintain this proper braced position. You will get uncomfortable keeping your core engaged, which is indeed tiring, and you will compromise the position.It is difficult to re-brace when you are already sitting down, and most of the time trying to do this just results in over-extending your lower back. Instead, stand up, and go through the sequence that way before sitting back down.By doing this at least every 20 to 30 minutes you will practice good posture while simultaneously combating the health effects of stagnation caused by prolonged sitting. In turn, many mobility problems will begin to resolve just by practicing better posture.Of course, just resetting your posture regularly will not address everything, especially if you have beat up your body as an athlete or at work. This is where direct mobility work comes in.Most of us have mobility restrictions even if we have good posture. Perhaps your left arm hurts when you raise it overhead‚Äîassuming you even can. Or like many, your knees sometimes ache when you attempt to squat or pick something up from the ground.Mobility restriction can afflict any of our joints or range of motion (ROM). Sure, maybe being a little restricted doesn‚Äôt sound so bad, but the causes of these restrictions can have health implications.A good place to start is by understanding the psoas muscle, located in the lower abdominals, which is found to be notoriously tight and stiff as a result of prolonged sitting.Stiffness of this muscle is a clinical indicator in lower back pain, and some believe it can cause ovary pain in women and even restrict blood flow.How do we mobilize the psoas muscle and release the tension? One easy way is to lie down and on the handle of a kettlebell, or find a way to press a lacrosse ball into the muscle; here‚Äôs a quick video of how to do that.Dr. Starrett categorizes mobility into 3 primary systems, and these are important to understand in order to prioritize further mobility work.The 3 mobility systems are:If you have a mobility issue or pain, and it is not the result of poor movement habits (such as those caused by poor posture), then the problem is most likely due to your joint mechanics. Basically, if you cannot get your joints to move correctly without pain or restriction, or your joints don‚Äôt sit where they are supposed to, then you likely have this problem.The end goal of any mobilization is to get your body into the positions it is supposed to be in, both while moving and at rest.For example, I get pain in my left shoulder when performing overhead pressing movements. I have noticed that I cannot pull my left shoulder as far back as my right shoulder during the bracing sequences and also when my arm is overhead. Unsurprisingly, the mobilizations that have been most helpful for me are those which pull my shoulder into its functional position while my arms are overhead.This is a matter of improving the joint mechanics by noticing that a joint is not behaving the way it should and then using mobility techniques to restore position and function.We‚Äôll discuss specific techniques in detail later, but banded distractions are particularly adept at restoring joint mechanics. These techniques involve wrapping a loop band around a pole at one end, and around the joint at the other end, and using the tension of the band to ‚Äúset‚Äù the joint capsule in a good position.After you check your joint mechanics, the next system to consider is sliding surface dysfunction. This is often overlooked, but sliding surface simply refers to how well your external tissues move over the internal tissues‚Äîhow well your skin moves over your muscles, for example.To observe your sliding surface function, use your index finger and middle fingers to press down on the back of your hand. You should be able to move the skin around by pressing in different directions. Notice that closing your hand into a fist reduces the range of sliding surface function.Regardless of your body position, you should have some level of sliding surface function everywhere on your body. Surface dysfunction restricts mobility by more-or-less acting as a cast over your body. Ever try squatting or kicking while wearing really tight jeans? It‚Äôs a bit like that.Tissue mashing techniques, such as laying on a lacrosse ball or foam roller, can help address sliding surface function. For more direct work, you can do things like the ‚Äútack and twist‚Äù or the ball whack.Usually addressing posture, movement habits, joint mechanics, and sliding surface function will restore someone‚Äôs range of motion without any stretching.However, if this is not the case, then you need to address muscle dynamics. Muscle dynamics simply refers to your muscle‚Äôs ability to ‚Äústretch.‚Äù This would be your typical idea of flexibility.Someone with good muscle dynamics in their hamstrings and hips can easily touch their toes, for example.To improve muscle dynamics, however, you shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äústretch‚Äù in the way that most people do. Typical stretching techniques involve reaching into your end range of motion, such as reaching as far as you can to touch your toes and then just striving to reach further for two minutes. This is known as ‚Äústatic‚Äù stretching.Static stretching is not the most effective, and it may also weaken muscles. Similarly to pulling a rope apart, you are making the muscle ‚Äúthinner‚Äù and also tightening ‚Äúknots‚Äù in the tissue.Instead, you want to use a method known as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). PNF stretching improves your flexibility by relaxing the muscle in pulses, rather than simply pulling it apart.PNF stretching is a method of contracting ‚Äî or tightening ‚Äî your muscle, then relaxing and letting go of tension while reaching into your end range.For example, if I am trying to improve my ability to touch my toes, I first reach for my toes as far as I can. Then I flex and create tension in my legs by tightening all the muscle in my quad and calves as though I were at the top of a heavy squat. After 5 seconds of this, I release the tension in my leg while simultaneously reaching further into the stretch.This is the basis for the Contract & Relax technique described in the next section, and we‚Äôll get more into the details there.Here‚Äôs the fun part: the mobility techniques (or ‚Äúmobs‚Äù for short).I can‚Äôt include specific mobs for every ailment in the scope of this article‚Äîbut fortunately, all mobs fit into at least one or more categories of mobility methods. By learning these categories, you can not only apply them to mobs you pick up out in your life, such as at the gym or during yoga classes, but you will also gain some ability to freestyle and create your own mobilizations based on your needs.Even so, I will include a few examples at the end of the article, along with a guide for finding mobs online.Pressure wave is a technique used when doing tissue mashing mobs. It involves using an object, such as a lacrosse ball, to dig into your muscle and unglue knotted tissues.To help identify when/where to use pressure wave, understand this: your tissues should feel pliable when relaxed. When you find a muscle that is tender to the touch and stiff, or beef-jerky like, that is likely something known as a ‚Äútrigger point,‚Äù and could use some not-so-tender loving care.Trigger points are areas where tissue has formed into knots, creating tension throughout limb and likely affecting the entire body.To do this technique you will need an object of some kind, but I recommend a lacrosse ball or a foam roller.If you don‚Äôt know what a foam roller is, here‚Äôs an example. They are common at gyms and fitness centers and are generally easy to find.To perform a pressure wave, lie on the ball or roller while keeping your muscle completely relaxed. The intent is to ‚Äúsink‚Äù into the deepest layers of your muscle tissue at the location of a trigger point (muscle knot.)Now, slowly roll the trigger point over the ball or foam roller using the full weight of your body. The slower you move, the better. You will be able to handle more pressure and generally experience more positive results.Ever had a deep tissue massage? Well, this is the same thing but without having to pay someone $200 to dig their elbows into your muscle tissue.Here‚Äôs a video for details on how to do a lower back pressure wave with a double lacrosse ball:We mentioned this technique briefly earlier as an alternative to static stretching.Contract & relax is a form of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching, which is a scientifically established method for improving muscle dynamics.You can use this technique to improve your end ranges of motion during stretching, or you can combine it with a foam roller or a ball.Mobility Project Example: CrossFit Seminar PNF Stretching (can be seen at about 4 minutes into the video):Banded flossing is one of my favorite new discoveries. Why? Because it addresses joint mechanics directly by isolating your joint capsule. This has been a game-changer for me, particularly as a tool for getting my left shoulder into better positions, and for work on my hips.Banded flossing involves taking a loop resistance band, such as the Rogue Monster Bands and looping it around a joint while the other end is attached to an anchor, such as a pull-up bar or the rails of your stairwell. This is known as a ‚Äúbanded distraction‚Äù.This allows you to pull the joint into an optimal position while you stretch using other techniques, like contract & relax.Our joint capsules are filled with thick, robust tissue, so stretching alone is not enough to create change. When you simply stretch without a band, the thinnest, most pliable parts of the tissue will experience the most change, while thick tissues‚Äîsuch as those in the joint capsule‚Äîwill stretch the least, if at all.Setting up a banded distraction allows you to isolate these thick tissues in your joints. Then you can add ‚Äúflossing‚Äù to feel around for tight spots and create change by doing contract & relax.For example, in the pictures above, I set up a banded distraction for my shoulder joint. I use the force of the band to pull my shoulder joint to the back of the socket, an area that is troublesome for me.Then I ‚Äúfloss‚Äù by grabbing my hand behind my back, and moving my hand up my back towards my neck. As I move my hand, I find tension in my shoulder, and will ‚Äúfloss‚Äù by moving my hand to different locations on my back.Here‚Äôs an example from MobilityWOD:Smash & floss involves flossing while mashing your tissue with a foam roller or a lacrosse ball.Once you have ‚Äúsmashed‚Äù your tissue by relaxing onto a lacrosse ball or other some-such device, you can ‚Äúfloss‚Äù the tissue by going through a range of motion. This is particularly effective when you find a tight area of tissue.In the pictures above, I use smash and floss to address the tissues in my leg just above my kneecap.First I relax onto a lacrosse ball, then when I find a tight spot, I slowly raise my heel to my butt. If I find tension while flossing, I will lower and raise my heel to release the tissue in my knee.This can be done with almost any tissue mashing technique that is working on a limb. If you have a lacrosse ball under your tricep (the arm muscles on the back of your upper arm, behind the bicep) you can floss by bending your arm at the elbow.If you are mashing tissue in your calf, you can floss by moving your ankle around. etc. Combine this with other techniques like contract & relax and you can get some great results.Video from Mobility Project ‚Äî Psoas Flossing:Tack and twist is pretty basic, and it‚Äôs great for restoring sliding surface function. If you find a patch of skin anywhere on your body that has poor sliding surface function, get a lacrosse ball or other ball that has some ‚Äúgrippyness‚Äù to it.Press the ball into the area of focus, and twist the ball to take up slack in the fascia and tissue underneath. Maintain pressure while twisting the ball.Voodoo floss is a tool created by Dr. Kelly Starrett to restore mobility by creating multiple effects at once.Basically, voodoo floss is a rubber ace bandage, and you can do wonders for your mobility by wrapping it around a joint to create massive compression.The bands help create ‚Äúgapping‚Äù in the tissue to allow greater blood flow. Simultaneously, the bands restore sliding surface function and can allow you to get into good positions that are otherwise limited.This, more than any other mobility technique, feels like magic to me. Of all the gear you can get to start mobilizing, I want you to get Voodoo floss bands.You don‚Äôt have to go with Kelly‚Äôs brand. There are plenty of inexpensive options such as this one by WODfitters on Amazon.To use Voodoo floss, wrap the band around a joint just above, and just below the area where you are attempting to make a change.Kelly recommends creating stretching the bands to about 75% of their ability as you wrap them over the tissue in question, and 50% stretch as you wrap around the opposite side of the limb.If wrapping your knees, for example, you‚Äôd take one band and wrap it with 75% stretch when on the front of your leg, and 50% on the back of your leg.Wrap the band with about a half-inch of overlap as well. For larger joints like the knees, you should use two bands. Wrap one around your leg just above the knee joint, and wrap the other just below the knee joint.If you have extra band, you can create an X shape over the most sensitive tissue to create extra compression.Once the joint is wrapped, attempt to get into positions that you are trying to improve.If you are trying to improve your squat mechanics, then you should squat, for example.If you are not addressing a specific position, and are just trying to improve the joint or remove pain, then simply move through as much range of motion as possible.You could address elbow tendinitis by wrapping the elbow and then extending your arm, doing arm circles, raising your arm up and down like a scarecrow waving at someone, etc.Generally, you should Voodoo floss for 1 to 2 minutes, or until you feel tingling in the wrapped limb. If you feel tingling or numbness, you are done. Remove the Voodoo floss and go to the other limb.You may also notice discoloration in your skin while Voodoo flossing. Generally speaking, your skin will look pale. If you touch your skin, it should redden like you are touching a sunburn. If you touch your skin and there is no reddening, then remove the Voodoo floss.Removing the bands will create a flushing effect and cause increased blood flow in the limbs. This will cause your skin to redden a bit, but this is a good thing.The increased blood flow, following compression, helps heal joints and tissues by flushing blood into areas that may be otherwise restricted by stiffness or dysfunction.Mobility Project Example ‚Äî Ankle VooDoo Flossing:Flexion gapping is a technique for restoring range and function to a joint. You can stretch all you want, but sometimes you need to find ways to open the tissues inside a joint capsule. VooDoo flossing is one way to do this. The other is to use an object to create ‚Äúgapping‚Äù via leverage.To create gapping in the knee joint, for example, take a towel and roll it up into a thick cylinder shape. Put the towel inside your knee joint and squeeze your leg over the towel.This will create a gapping effect as it pulls apart your knee joint, allowing blood flow to reach new areas.This is akin to blowing out the dust in a rusty door hinge. Seriously, think of a door hinge: you can‚Äôt get all the dust out until you take apart the hinge and create space.One can use a towel, a lacrosse ball, create a banded distraction, or use Voodoo floss to create gapping in a joint.I will often stick a lacrosse ball under my armpit and squeeze my arm to my side to create gapping in my shoulder, for example.Gapping is best for addressing stubborn pain or joint dysfunction. Stretching has no effect creating gapping, so for many of us, we will not have ever done this work before now.Mobility Project Example: Creaky Knees Routine (Flexion Gapping at 5 minutes into the video):Once you understand the types of techniques used for mobility work, next comes understanding how to make a routine and to train in the long run.Dr. Starrett describes 7 rules for this exact purpose. I‚Äôve summarized them here in simplified form. They are essential for forming a foundational view of mobilizing and creating a sense of ‚Äúintuition‚Äù about your mobility work.They are as follows.As they say, what gets measured gets managed, and this is the first rule of mobility. Everything you should do when mobilizing should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.If you have movement restriction or pain in your knees, for example, you should test by seeing how well you can get into a squat position or a lunge. If you feel pain or restriction, then this is a position which you want to work on.Perform some mobs (mobility techniques) on the tissues you think are contributing to the pain or restriction. Then retest the squat/lunge.Did your mobility improve? Yes? Good, what you are doing is working.If you do not improve, then likely your pain or restriction is caused by different tissues. Try some different mobs and test again.While testing and retesting helps your brain remember the improvement and that it can reach new ranges of mobility, you should be aware of anything that feels like ‚Äútoo much‚Äù or is just weird.Mobilizing tissue is unpleasant. However, there‚Äôs a difference between unpleasant and harmful. If you think you are injuring yourself, you probably are.You should not experience regular and easily repeatable ‚Äúsharp‚Äù pains while mobilizing. You should also not experience grinding pain, hot burning pain, or sharp pain, then you are likely making yourself worse and not better.Kelly Starrett likes to say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go into the pain cave! Stand at the entrance to the pain cave, but don‚Äôt go in.‚ÄùIn short, if it feels sketchy, it‚Äôs sketchy, and don‚Äôt continue doing it.Mobility is an ongoing process, and habit. There is no difference between picking up a barbell vs. picking up a pillow: the optimal body positions are the same.Practice the bracing sequence and endeavor to move with good posture every day, throughout your day to day life, and build these habits in the long run.Furthermore, do at least 15 minutes a day of mobs. It takes time to change the tissues in your body.Fascia is dense connective tissue that runs throughout your entire body, and is a major component in mobility. However, according to Dr. Starrett, it takes 6 months of consistent mobility work for some fascia to have changed permanently, and up to 2 years for more stubborn parts of the tissue.Depending on what you are trying to do, things may go a little faster than that, but the point is that this kind of work takes consistency over time.Sure, you may miss a day here and there, but the point is to intend to do mobility work every day, and stick to it most of the time.(I‚Äôll get into how to create your 15-minute mobility routine below.)Prioritize mobs that simulate real-life situations. If you have trouble raising your arms over your head, like when getting something from a tall shelf, then you are missing an overhead range of motion.Instead of laying down and mobilizing the shoulder joint or mashing the tissue with your hand down by your side, mobilize with the arm overhead in as-close-to the position you are trying to improve.Remember the bracing sequence while you are mobilizing. If you have to round your shoulders and bend your neck or over-extend your back in order to do a mob, then you will not get the results you want.Ingraining poor mechanics and bad positions is counter-intuitive to the goal of becoming more mobile. Always prioritize good spinal mechanics and posture first before exploring different parts of a mob. If you can only reach a certain position when your posture is compromised, then it‚Äôs not worth reaching anyway.If you perform a mob you find online, feel free to modify it and explore beyond the limits of the instructions. As long as you maintain good posture, you know your muscles and tissues better than anyone else.If you can get more benefit by moving into more challenging areas, do it!If you are mobilizing your shoulder with a lacrosse ball, you might move into the upper lat and ribs with it, or rotate your arm to a different position.Using the guidelines mentioned in the last section, you can turn any mobilization into a sort of ‚Äúinformed freestyle.‚Äù As long as you maintain good posture, do what you think will help you.Making a grimace shortens your neck flexors, but it also associates pain with mobility.Use mobs, no matter how uncomfortable, as an opportunity to practice zen indifference, at least outwardly.Even if it feels like the house is burning down around you as you explore a challenging bit of tissue, your facial expression should say ‚Äúit‚Äôs no big deal, this is fine.‚ÄùWe‚Äôve covered the 7 rules of mobility so you will know how to think about mobility. We‚Äôve covered the techniques so you know what to look for and what to do.Now to develop your own habits for mobility work.When it comes to improving your tissues, consistency is more important than intensity. As we mentioned earlier, fascia takes up to 2 years of consistent work to change.Kelly‚Äôs model for improving mobility is that you need to commit at least 10 to 15 minutes every day to mobilizing.If you do more, awesome, but at minimum, you need to do 10 to 15 minutes a day.Also, you should do at least 2 minutes per mob, every time. According to Dr. Starrett:‚Äúresearch unquestionably asserts that it takes at least 2 minutes to make soft-tissue change, which means that 2 minutes is your minimum therapeutic dose per position.‚Äù (Starrett, How to Become a Supple Leopard, Page 154.)This should result in picking 3 or 4 mobs to make into a 15-minute session.How should you decide which techniques to do? First, follow the 3 rules of pain:When prioritizing mobs, pain takes precedence. You might have stiffness in your shoulder, pain in your knee, and low range of motion in your ankles.Regardless of what else you do, at least 1 or 2 techniques of your session should be for your knee pain every session, until the pain resolves.Let‚Äôs say it again: Pain takes precedence!3 rules for how to address pain are:Now, to be clear, pain does not refer to a serious injury. If you think you herniated a disk, tore a muscle, or dislocated a joint, see a doctor. However, if you tweak something, feel knee or joint pain that is not a serious injury, then prioritize it when creating your mobility prescription.Once you have identified that an area is painful, go through the bracing sequence and see if it is difficult to get things into the correct place.If your shoulder hurts, check to see if it is not aligned correctly over your hips due to a lack of range of motion.Once you have identified any posture dysfunction, start with banded distractions and techniques focused on getting your shoulder into the proper place.For rule 2, if something is not moving ‚Äî such as the inability to move your ankle around ‚Äî get it moving. Sliding surface techniques like smash and floss or pressure wave can be great for this, as well as Voodoo floss to create compression.Finally, for rule 3, work upstream and downstream. Many of our mobility problems are caused indirectly by other tissues than the ones that actually hurt.You may have shoulder pain, not because of anything wrong with your shoulder, but because of tightness in your lats, back, or traps. Even a tight hip can result in poor shoulder mechanics if it makes you move funky.A short description of how this process might look would be this: first, identify any poor posture with regard to your pain. For a shoulder, maybe you can‚Äôt get it back all the way during the bracing sequence.Address this with banded flossing techniques, primarily.Then, see if your shoulder can move well. Try raising your arm overhead. If your ability to move your shoulder around is limited, address this by lying on a lacrosse ball or smashing the collar of a barbell into your shoulder muscle to break up stiff tissue.Finally, work upstream and downstream of the issue by doing some techniques for your lats (the muscles on your side, under your armpit) and your upper back and neck.You may still have room for a few techniques after resolving painful tissue, or maybe you don‚Äôt have any pain. From this point, simply apply the 3 rules to your stiffest tissues, or to the areas you just want to improve.For example, if you cannot squat well because your muscles are tight, or you have trouble raising an arm overhead, pick a few mobs to correct the problem.Personally, when I make a mobility routine for the day, I will use 2 or 3 techniques addressing painful tissue as well as upstream or downstream tissue, and then I‚Äôll do the rest on areas where I have restriction but things are not painful.Honestly, I would love it if everyone would just read a textbook on mobility like Kelly‚Äôs How to Become a Supple Leopard, but that isn‚Äôt exactly realistic. Heck, it‚Äôs taken me a month and a half of daily work to finish it myself, and this is my day job!For this reason, I‚Äôve decided to ask you to find your mobs by using the wondrous power of the internet.Thankfully, Dr. Starrett‚Äôs methods and terminology have spread like wildfire since he first published his book in 2011. Most of the time you can find a great mob just by searching the joint or issue, and the mobility technique.For example, you could search ‚Äúhip opening smash and floss techniques.‚Äù (More on doing good queries below.)The mobs you find don‚Äôt even need to be that instructional‚Äîyou just need a starting point whereby you can apply the 7 rules of mobility, and the techniques described in this article.If someone shows you where to put a lacrosse ball to release tension in your knee, for example, you can explore your mobility from there by simply applying the techniques in this article.All you really need to know is where to put the lacrosse ball to start. Contract & relax, or floss by bending your leg. Then pressure wave across an area of tough tissue.Regardless of where you find your mobs, there are 3 main points I‚Äôd like to emphasize:The easiest way to find mobs and start doing this work is to sign up for MobilityWOD. MobilityWOD is the product of Dr. Kelly Starrett and his wife, former whitewater rafting world champion Juliet Starrett.The program takes you through daily mobilizations using all of the same methods as Kelly‚Äôs book, as well as everything new they‚Äôve created since that time. Furthermore, you get access to their complete library of daily mobility routines, which includes literally thousands of videos on mobilizations.Instead of having to peruse youtube finding mobs, you can get it straight from the horse's mouth. It‚Äôs also only $9.99 a month for their main program.MobilityWOD also offers certifications and deeper courses for fitness professionals. Being that Kelly‚Äôs work is the foundation of mobility work in the CrossFit community, the MobilityWOD certifications are well recognized, and these are a powerful tool for the arsenal of any trainer or coach.mobilitywod.comWhether or not you join MobilityWOD, knowing how to find more mobs can be a useful skill. To do this, you‚Äôll want to have a structure for doing internet searches.When designing a search query, you need to identify two things:Identifying the area or position you want to improve simply comes back to the 3 rules of pain: prioritize painful tissue, then 1. If it‚Äôs not where it should be, get it where it should be (often the case with joints) 2. If it‚Äôs not moving, get it moving (restriction and tightness) and 3. work upstream and downstream of the issue.These rules should also help you identify the technique you are looking for. For example, if your pain is in a joint, then work on banded distractions that put the joint in a good place. Floss by moving your limb through a range of motion. This covers both rules 1 and 2. For rule 3, work upstream and downstream of the issue, this is where I‚Äôll look for smashing techniques like smash and floss, or pressure wave. A simple way to search for these is to search based on the tool used. For example: ‚ÄúLacrosse ball techniques for your knees/hips/etc.‚ÄùThe final result should be something like:‚ÄúBanded distractions for hip impingement.‚Äù‚ÄúLacrosse ball tissue mashing for knee pain during lunges/squats‚Äù‚ÄúVoodoo floss for ankle mobility‚ÄùI know this might seem like a lot of responsibility, but not to worry, Dr. Kelly Starrett himself offers a large library of free mobility videos already. These can be found on Youtube.Tonight, Identify 1 or 2 tissues where you want to improve your mobility. Go to a sports store, and buy a lacrosse ball. Now find 3 to 4 techniques online or from Kelly Starrett‚Äôs channel to improve your mobility. If you want, it‚Äôs also good to have a cheap foam roller for less intense tissue mashing. Most health clubs have these available, so feel free to just use your gym‚Äôs gear.Whether you do stretching or you do tissue mashing on the lacrosse ball, practice as many of the mobility techniques in this article as possible, particularly contract & relax, and flossing if possible.Now go on Amazon, and order a set of Voodoo floss, and get a loop band of some kind for banded distractions. You can also just use bands at a gym if you have access to loop bands there. I prefer a thicker loop band, as they provide much more force for banded distractions.Do not underestimate the power of random objects for mobilizing. You can do a lot of work with some household items. For example, I have a metal ‚Äúliberty‚Äù water bottle I often use to foam roll my calves when I‚Äôm out and about.There are a lot of items you can use for mobilizing, but only a few that you really ‚Äúneed.‚ÄùI perform 99% of my mobs with VooDoo floss, pull-up bands, lacrosse balls, and a foam roller.WODFitters Voodoo floss $25 on Amazon2 Lacrosse balls $10 on AmazonPull-up loop bands $25 on AmazonBasic foam roller $10 on AmazonThere are many advanced pieces of gear out there, and they all work great for improving your mobility game. However, to be honest, 99% of the work you need can be done with everything listed above. With one exception:Foam rollers.As you get more mobile and your tissues become more pliable, you‚Äôll probably find that the basic foam roller at your gym or that you bought for $10 on Amazon just isn‚Äôt cutting it.For this reason, I strongly suggest ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù to an advanced foam roller like a Rumble Roller after a month or two. These are more expensive ‚Äî usually in the range of $50 to $70 depending on the length ‚Äî but in my opinion, they are the only way to keep a foam roller relevant after a few months of mobilizing.Personally, I use the Rumble Roller, which is medium-firm and has ‚Äúspikes‚Äù that help reach into the tissue. It‚Äôs available for about $45 on Amazon.I thought I‚Äôd include one a quick example routine you can use. If you‚Äôre feeling resistance to the process of developing your own routine, this is a place you can start.I‚Äôve picked 4 uncommon, but highly effective mobs to address shoulder mobility, hip impingements, the psoas muscle to release lower back pain, and a tack & twist that works magic for jaw tension.While doing the mob, you might not realize just how much tension you carry in your jaw and face. Once you complete one side, take a few seconds to just notice how much tension is released.The side of your jaw you just worked should feel way more relaxed and loose than the other.You can also perform this mob for the muscles in your face by tacking the lacrosse ball to your temples and twisting to take up the slack. Then make any and every funny face you can think of for two minutes.These mobs have eliminated jaw popping for me.The shoulders are my nemesis. As a lifelong martial artist and swimmer, I‚Äôve developed imbalances where the front of my shoulders are stronger than the back, creating stiffness and joint pain.Smashing techniques help ‚Äúunglue‚Äù all these stiff tissues, and this one, in particular, is my favorite.This also allows me to demonstrate how versatile many tools can be. Are you at the gym without a foam roller or lacrosse ball? Guess what, barbells are phenomenal, too.Alternatively, if you don‚Äôt have a barbell at home but you want to do this mob, simply flip over and lie on either a foam roller or a lacrosse ball, and move your arm as though doing snow angels.Anyway, here‚Äôs the instruction:This one is uncomfortable and strange, but you will be amazed by the results. Have a kettlebell lying around home or at the gym? You can use this tool in two ways.For the first technique,If you don‚Äôt have a kettlebell, just press the ball into your psoas using your hands.For Technique 2:The most famous and infamous mob in Kelly‚Äôs book, the couch stretch is an amazing yet brutal hip opener. This stretch is by far the most powerful for getting those tight hips open and addressing the negative effects of sitting.You can also turn the dial up to 11 by created a banded distraction, also known as the ‚ÄúSuper Couch.‚ÄùWord to the wise: this stretch is called the couch stretch because you can perform it using a couch to both lower the intensity, and give you access to a television to distract you from the discomfort. With that said, try to use a wall or flat surface if possible‚Äîthat may be the only way to perform the banded version of this stretch.Super Couch VariationSoft Couch VariationI strongly suggest using the classic couch stretch, but if your hips are incredibly tight, or you just want to get some quick work in while watching the tube, try the couch stretch on an actual couch.Well there you have it ‚Äî now you know how to write yourself a 15-minute mobility prescription.I know it was a long and in-depth article, but this stuff is just so beneficial and important.Everyone has mobility problems. I don‚Äôt care who you are, if you haven‚Äôt been doing this kind of work for years, or even if you have been ‚Äî I‚Äôd bet all my money you have some tissue that could improve.What I love about Dr. Starrett‚Äôs work is that it provides a foundational system by which you can comprehend mobility. It lets you see the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù instead of just seeing random Instagram models rolling out their quads.Personally, I have deeply enjoyed diving into this topic, and in a mere 2 months or so working on my mobility, I have made huge progress on issues I‚Äôve had for years.My left shoulder is now pain-free when I do overhead pressing, and I‚Äôve improved my knee mobility greatly. I‚Äôm able to nearly sit on my heels which is something I haven‚Äôt been able to do since a high school injury.I‚Äôd personally suggest going back through this article one more time and taking notes, especially on the mobility techniques and the rules of mobility sections.I also strongly recommend joining www.mobilitywod.com, and if you are interested in diving deep on the subject, Dr. Kelly Starrett‚Äôs book How to Become a Supple Leopard really is the last book you‚Äôll ever need for this topic.If you make a habit of just 15 minutes a day of mobility work, specifically targeting the tissues that need it most, I promise you will feel results.This is the kind of stuff few people ever work on, and therefore, it‚Äôs hard to realize what kind of headway you‚Äôll actually make. But once you get started, I think you will be truly amazed at how quickly you improve.As always, thank you so much for reading, and good luck on your health and fitness journey.üëâThe Better Humans publication is a part of a network of personal development tools.

"If You Want to Succeed as a Creative, You Have to Forget About Outcomes",Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-not-to-succeed-as-a-creative-dbc267a03fe6,Adrian Drew,13600,6,1426,"When my articles don‚Äôt get curated on Medium, I‚Äôm usually pretty disappointed. And I know for certain that I‚Äôm not the only one.It‚Äôs common amongst us creatives to feel a little piqued when we work hard on something only to see it underperform. It leaves us frustrated, disheartened, and questioning our skills and competency.Alas, many of us quit early. We blame ourselves, the market, or some other extraneous factor and give up altogether.But should we let a bad response or minor rejection stop us completely? Is that why we started this journey, to see numbers on screens and our name up in lights? Of course not.Van Gogh didn‚Äôt sell a single painting in his lifetime. Not one. But did he abandon his passion for art? Like hell he did.When we face rejection, many of us forget one fundamental fact about our craft. We don‚Äôt do it just for the reward. We‚Äôre not creating solely to go viral or get curated. We create because it‚Äôs what we love to do.According to Steven Pressfield, every person identifies themselves in one of two ways: either by their rank within a hierarchy or their connection to a territory.To put it differently, some of us assess our self-worth or success based upon where we fit into society ‚Äî the hierarchy. By our status, class, or salary. Others judge themselves on their commitment to their craft or their ‚Äúterritory.‚Äù‚ÄúOf the two orientations, the hierarchical seems to be the default setting. It‚Äôs the one that kicks in automatically when we‚Äôre kids. We run naturally in packs and cliques; without thinking about it, we know who‚Äôs the top dog‚Ä¶ and we know our own place.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs natural to place ourselves somewhere within the pecking order and judge ourselves accordingly. But this hierarchical orientation is also why so many of us have lost touch with our true purpose: to create.We all have a territory. Stevie Wonder‚Äôs territory is his piano. Tiger Woods‚Äô territory is the golf course. Mine is my desk, and yours probably is too.Problems arise when we start treating our work as a hierarchical pursuit. When we work in order to attain money, status, or power, we lose touch with the real reason we started creating in the first place.We stop working solely to produce something new and wonderful and start working for other reasons ‚Äî reasons that we‚Äôre not passionate about. And therein lies the problem.I don‚Äôt doubt that some of us embarked upon our creative pursuits with money, status, or power in mind. Perhaps even all three. The idea of becoming a viral YouTuber or bestselling novelist is enough to tempt us all.The thing is, if we‚Äôre working for those reasons and nothing else, we won‚Äôt get very far. Why? Because we‚Äôll soon run out of ideas.How do I know? Because I‚Äôve been there. I remember researching dropshipping fresh out of high school, tantalized by the thought of making a six-figure income by selling miscellaneous objects like Yoda mugs and children‚Äôs toys.But how long can a person keep that up if they don‚Äôt care about either product? Sure, I might have been able to sell a few items and make a little money, but what would that really give me, other than capital? Satisfaction? Fulfillment? Nope.It would give me digits in my bank and a longing for more from life. It would enable me to earn a little extra cash, but deep down I‚Äôd always know that I‚Äôd sold out rather than following my true passion. And before long, I‚Äôd quit. We all would.In the same way, if we‚Äôre just writing or creating to earn money, status, or virality, we might as well give up now.The thing is, every creative industry runs on one thing and one thing only: ideas. And if we‚Äôre working for anything other than passion and love for what we do, we‚Äôre going to run out of those ideas very, very quickly.Many writers ask me how I manage to continue releasing new and original content every day. The answer? I write when I feel the need to share something, not when I want to make money or impress people.You see, many of us have this false idea that we‚Äôre writing for an audience that can somehow be played. We sit for hours trying to figure out what our readers want to hear rather than writing about the messages we actually want to share.The thing that many of us don‚Äôt realize is that the market can‚Äôt be played. If we try to dupe our audience by writing content that we think will sell, we‚Äôll fail.All successful writers have one thing in common: an important message or idea to share. That rule applies everybody from Ernest Hemingway to Benjamin Hardy, Ph.D.Sure, some writers have seen success by playing the market, but they don‚Äôt last very long. Only for as long as they can uphold their facade or until they run out of false ideas.When I first began writing, I set up a travel blog called ‚ÄúThe Impartialist.‚Äù Don‚Äôt ask me why it was called that or why I launched it because, honestly, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd been on around three holidays in five years, was still a sixteen-year-old schoolkid, and had no idea what impartialist even meant.I managed to pump out four blog posts before I ran out of ideas. Why did I run out of ideas? Because I was working for the hierarchy, not for passion.I didn‚Äôt have any real value to offer, I just thought the idea of being a travel blogger sounded really cool. I wanted to be that person, but I didn‚Äôt necessarily want to share those messages.Fast-forward several years and my fianc√© gets diagnosed with cancer. Suddenly, I‚Äôm miserable and anxious and am devouring book after book about personal development in an attempt to preserve my sanity.With so much knowledge to share, I decided to revisit my passion for writing, set up a publication, and share what I‚Äôd learned.What‚Äôs the difference? In the first instance, I was writing because I wanted to adopt a particular image. I wanted to be one of those cool Instagram travel bloggers who gets free flights and boutique holidays to Vietnam.In the second, I was writing because I had a burning passion to share with the world something I cared about.And in the first instance, I crashed out after four blog posts. In the second, I‚Äôve been writing nearly every day for a year, and I have more ideas than I have the time to write.When you‚Äôre in the right industry, when your work aligns with your passion, you rarely run out of things to say. You‚Äôre so enveloped in your love for what you do that it consumes you.I read personal development books and novels in just about every spare moment. Writing is, quite literally, my life.Alas, I rarely run out of ideas, and if I do, I‚Äôll go to the library, pick up something new to read, and voila. I have ideas.More than that, though, I don‚Äôt write to make money or please anybody. Sure, I get a little miffed when I spend hours on a piece that doesn‚Äôt get curated, but I‚Äôve had hundreds of rejected articles that have been total flops. Does that stop me? No.You‚Äôve got to be serious about the game you‚Äôre playing. You have to take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, is this me? Is this the work I want to be doing?If I was the last person on earth, would I still do it? And if the answer is yes, then congratulations. You‚Äôre working territorially, not hierarchically. And you‚Äôre far more likely to succeed.If I were to condense the entire contents of this article into one sentence, it would be this: You need to forget about outcomes. You need to forget about likes, views, money, and all the other surface-level stuff.If you want to succeed, if you want to keep moving forward and ensure that you always have new ideas to play with, you need to keep creating, regardless of the end result.What‚Äôs important is that you show up every single day and put in the hours. That you continue to improve and develop your skills. That every time you sit down to make something new, you remind yourself why you‚Äôre doing this and why it‚Äôs important to you.When you create purely out of love and commitment to what you do, you become unstoppable. When you create for money, for the image, or for the power that it grants, however, you don‚Äôt stand a chance.",25/07/2019,0,0,4,0,1050,698,1,0,0,3,121
The Art of Asking the Right Questions While Hiring Remotely,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-art-of-asking-the-right-questions-while-hiring-remotely-d4498195dda1,Marina Vorontsova,288,7,1047,"Hiring someone remotely is even tougher than doing it in person. Sure, phones and the internet have been around for a while, but when all you have is a bad connection and some software, assessing a person is hard. My company has interviewed more than 1,000 remote developers over the last three years and we‚Äôve learned a lot from our own mistakes.Here‚Äôs everything I know about asking the right questions in remote interviews.Provided you have already prepared an excellent job description, sourced potential candidates, and screened through dozens of resumes, now it‚Äôs time to interview a few promising candidates.For the simplicity of this article, we‚Äôll treat both telephone and online interviews as roughly the same, because both require asking the right questions and have similar procedures and stages. However, there are, of course, inherently underlying differences between the two types, such as an inability to make eye contact, observe the candidate‚Äôs body language, energy level, and so on. Nevertheless, due to the remote nature of both types of interviews, we‚Äôve decided to treat them as one.Overall, any interview has three distinct stages:Let‚Äôs walk through them in orderThe opening, which takes no more than 10% of the allotted time, is an important stage often disregarded by recruiters, yet unfoundedly so. It‚Äôs generally recommended to use the opening stage to establish rapport and instill in the interviewee the sense of comfort.There are several things you can do here to make your companion feel more comfortable and prepare them for the interviewing process ahead. First of all, be friendly, be on time, introduce yourself, and tell a candidate something about yourself. Spend a little time explaining the structure of the interview and questions you‚Äôre about to ask.Below, we‚Äôll make a couple of example questions and sentences, which you can use during the opening stage of the interview.Since you can‚Äôt ask questions such as, ‚ÄúHow did you find the place?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow was your commute?‚Äù (It‚Äôs remote work we‚Äôre talking about, after all), you can still ask similar questions, for example, those related to the software you‚Äôre using for conducting interviews, like: ‚ÄúDid you find the system easy to use?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWas it difficult for you to figure out how to log in and use the software?‚ÄùDuring the interview, I‚Äôm going to ask you about your experience.Some of those questions would be asked to find out about you as an individual. We‚Äôre very interested in finding if there‚Äôs a good fit between your interests and abilities and our needs.If, at any point in time, you would like to ask questions about the position and the company, please, feel free to do so, I‚Äôll be very glad to be of assistance.Now, let me briefly describe our company, its mission, its goals, and what we‚Äôre looking for.It will be of great value if you add something about the awkwardness of being interviewed and how you‚Äôve been yourself through this process multiple times and it doesn‚Äôt just get better with time. Statements like this are pretty effective at dispelling the tension that undermines communication.You might also want to highlight something from the candidate‚Äôs resume praising him for a particular achievement or personal quality. Find something in common‚Äîfor example, you both speak French or are interested in manga. Be creative and come up with your own ideas.Plan to spend around 80% of the interview time on this stage. Use this time wisely and gather as much information about the candidate as you can, and in the meantime, sell them your organization. During the body stage, you‚Äôll need to assess the candidate‚Äôs qualifications, knowledge, skills, experience, and compare them to those you have on your job description.There are going to be some crucial moments here when you have to make everything possible to get the specific answers about the concrete accomplishments listed on the resume. It can be seriously tough, especially if the candidate avoids certain questions or if you interview for a senior position, where some of those accomplishments might be somewhat intangible.Moreover, along with the concrete professional accomplishments, you‚Äôre assessing candidate‚Äôs personal qualities, such as leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills, motivation, etc.Use scenario-based questions to determine how people handle situations (even hypothetical). To predict future performance, use behavioral interview questions, which are typically not framed as questions (and start with something like ‚ÄúTell us about a time when ‚Ä¶‚Äù). Behavioral questions are often used to find out how a person behaved in the past because the past is the most accurate predictor of the future. Look at the following examples:By the end of the stage, ask for examples of previous work (e.g. customer survey, brochure, sales results, leads generated, as long as the information is not proprietary) and references from former employers and colleagues.Plan another 10% of your allotted timing to wrap up the conversation.During this time, thank the candidate for showing up on time and for having a wonderful educating conversation.Ask if the candidate has any questions for you or about the company and position. Spend some time answering those questions. Ask if there is still anything that has not been covered to ensure the candidate fully understands the vacancy.Explain the hiring process one more time and inform the candidate of any other stages they will need to take, and when they should expect to hear back from you.If you still have time, try to promote your organization one more time, and target the specific features of your organization that might be interesting and appealing to the candidate.Shake hands, maintain eye contact, be polite, and stay friendly at all times.Asking the right questions is an art, but it‚Äôs also a science. You can train yourself to ask the right questions, learn how to exercise a structured, methodical approach to the interviewing process, and to evaluate prospective candidates.Of course, interviewing is still subjective. However, by asking scenario-based and behavioral questions, you‚Äôll eliminate a part of the bias involved in the process. Try to neutralize subjectivity by avoiding being overly impressed with the candidate‚Äôs appearance or maturity or mistaking calm demeanor for a lack of energy or motivation. Don‚Äôt focus on only two or three major competencies, overlook the big picture, and so on.Learn not only to ask questions, but also to decipher the answers. But that‚Äôs another skill worth writing about. Maybe next time.",25/07/2019,0,0,8,26,1050,700,1,6,0,3,200
How Did We Learn to Recognise Human Faces?,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/do-we-inherit-the-way-we-recognise-faces-65fc8810cbc4,Yomna,742,6,1254,"The ability to recognise faces is important in our everyday social interactions. There is mixed evidence on the causes of individual differences in the perception of faces.Twin studies, and studies of people with congenital prosopagnosia (CP), support the theory that we inherit how we perceive faces. But there‚Äôs also evidence that social factors, like visual input, lead to differences in our abilities to recognise faces.Evidence from twin studies suggests that we inherit differences in our ability to recognise faces.Psychologists examine the concordance rates of pairs of twins that are either Monozygotic (MZ) or Dizygotic (DZ). The former share 100% of their genes, whereas the latter only share around half.A concordance rate is the rate of probability that 2 people with shared genes also share the same disease. If concordance rates for the ability to recognise faces are consistently higher for MZ twins, we can assume there might be a genetic cause.Using different face perception tests, MZ twins consistently show higher concordance rates. For example, Wilmer et al. (2010) carried out a study on 164 pairs of MZ twins and 125 pairs of DZ twins. They tested them on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT).They found that MZ twins displayed concordance rates of 0.70; while DZ twins displayed much lower concordance rates of 0.29. The much higher concordance rates for MZ twins provide strong evidence for a link between genes and face perception. The large sample used by Wilmer et al. makes this a strong study, and so the results gained are reliable.Polk et al. (2007) provide further support for the heritability of individual differences in face perception. They used fMRI scanning to observe neural activity patterns in the ventral visual cortex linked to the recognition of faces.Polk et al. gave participants recognition tasks and observed activity in the midfusiform gyrus. Parts of the midfusiform gyrus have been shown to be activated by faces. They found that neural activation patterns in response to faces are more similar in MZ twins than in DZ twins. This suggests that genetics are important in determining cortical responses to faces.Wilmer et al. (2010) and Polk et al. (2007) used very different experimental methods. In both studies, the results reflect the importance of zygosity on concordance rates. This provides strong evidence that we inherit our ability to perceive faces.A further study by Zhu et al. (2010) provides evidence for the heritability of specific cognitive abilities of face perception. They carried out their study on 102 pairs of MZ twins and 71 pairs of DZ twins, aged 7 to 19. They tested the participants on three measures of face-specific processing:Across the different measures, concordance rates were higher in MZ twins. Their findings were almost identical when: (1) the number of twin pairs were matched, and (2) opposite sex DZ twins were excluded from the results. This provides strong support for the theory that we inherit differences in our abilities to recognise faces.Yet Zhu et al.‚Äôs study also raises important issues that question the extent to which face perception is heritable. They found that age and gender also accounted for some amount of variance in the ability to perceive faces. There was also a substantial environmental influence on face recognition.Their results show that genetic factors explain more of the variance in face-perception among older children (aged 13 to 19) than among younger children (aged 7 to 12).These results do not pose a direct challenge to the theory that we inherit how we perceive faces, but they show that other factors also play a role.Heritability cannot be taken in isolation as an explanation for differences in face perception. Rather we also ought to examine age, gender, and environmental influences.When we study people with congenital prosopagnosia, we find even more evidence that we inherit the way we perceive faces.CP refers to a deficit in the ability to recognise faces. It is important to make a distinction between congenital and acquired prosopagnosia. Whereas the former is present from birth, the latter is triggered by an event, such as brain damage. Since CP is present from birth, it is likely that it is related to genetic causes.If more than one member of the same family has CP, it can be inferred that their ability to recognise faces is, at least in part, inherited.Schmalzl et al. (2008) provide evidence that there is a familial factor in CP. They presented a family study in which seven members of the same family, across four generations, had CP. They found that it was not a single shared trait that was linked to CP, but a cluster of related subtypes.Further support is drawn from a family study by Duchaine et al. (2007). They presented a case in which ten members of the same family were affected by prosopagnosia. Duchaine et al. tested the ten family members, as well as 20 controls, on the CFMT; the Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT); and the Eyes Test devised by Baron-Cohen et al. (2001). The controls were age-matched with the family members, to reduce the effect of age on face recognition.In comparison to the controls, the family members displayed deficits on tests requiring face memory and judgments of facial similarities, despite being highly functioning in their daily lives.The participants were also tested on their memory of facial identity, using famous faces. They were shown 60 famous faces for 5 seconds each (Duchaine and Nakayama 2005) and were asked to identify the face.However, Duchaine et al. do not establish a causal link between participants‚Äô poor performance on this test and their ability to recognise faces.It is difficult to exclude the effects of other factors. For example, their poor performance on this test could be accounted for by their lack of interest in celebrity culture. They could lack knowledge of the famous faces shown, rather than lacking the ability to recognise them.That‚Äôs the problem with these family studies. They‚Äôre focused on specific cases, which makes it harder to generalise a particular rule from them to the rest of the population.Even so, this study uses a variety of different tests, all producing consistent results. This provides strong evidence supporting the heritability of our abilities to recognise faces.There is also a strong literature of evidence that attributes these individual differences to the nurture side of the debate.Le Grand et al. (2003) present evidence that early deprivation of visual input to the right hemisphere of the brain undermines the development of normal face processing expertise. This suggests that the neural circuitry underlying face processing is not pre-specified and that it requires early visual experience to develop.Webster et al. (2011) provide evidence that the ability to recognise faces is affected by adaptation. They found that the appearance of faces was affected by the characteristics of faces viewed previously. The appearance of faces was also found to be dependent on the viewing context.Studies like these support the importance of social factors in how we recognise faces. This suggests that the way we recognise faces is not fixed, and can‚Äôt be attributed alone to what we inherit.Psychologists have explored different causes for differences in our abilities to recognise faces. Studies of people with CP, as well as twin studies, consistently show a strong link between genes and our abilities to recognise faces. The variance in the methods and samples used gives these studies reliability and validity. They strongly support the theory that individual differences in face perception are inherited.Taking these studies alongside those supporting social causes, the evidence suggests that our ability to recognise faces is affected by both genetic and social factors.",25/07/2019,2,0,1,13,1050,631,3,1,0,14,226
Mentors and Sidekicks Now Hold Crucial Roles in Marketing,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/brands-mentors-and-sidekicks-in-the-new-economy-f98d2d6424c7,Mike Bruening,32,8,1287,"We are moving from a consumer economy based on products and experiences to one of transformation. There is a convergence of new tools, unlimited abundance, and a reevaluation of consumerism that will trigger the emergence of a global phenomenon of personal and societal improvement called the Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy.The Hero‚Äôs Journey is a story of an ordinary person that receives a call to take on a challenge that will drive personal growth. Joseph Campbell discovered that this Hero‚Äôs Journey was prevalent across all cultures around the globe and dates back to early civilization. The longing for people to take a Hero‚Äôs Journey is so universal in our current society; we sometimes do not notice it. Almost all entertainment, from classical dramas to Star Wars to The Fortnite video game series, taps into these transformational steps to tell a story.In this coming transformational economy, consumers will move away from spending on things and activities and will start to pay for tools and experiences to help in their personal growth and improvement. This shift in purchasing will change everything. The worldwide consumer-based economy of $40 trillion will be turned on its head.In this new economy, brand managers and marketers must address the question that consumers will ask when confronted with a buying decision:Will this product or activity help me reach my goals in this journey, or is this purchase an indulgent reward/distraction?In the coming Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy, mentors will play a significant role. Similar to Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid, mentors in this economy will be crucial to helping personal change.Mentors have vital qualities that make them inherently gifted to assist in these individual quests. Mentors:Previously mentors have held the position of coaches, professors, and employers, but the engagement of mentors was often random and mentor-driven. Roles of mentors in the Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy will play out much differently. Unlike the mentor-student relationships of the past, that were close personal dealings, many people looking to improve or transform their lives will likely never meet their mentors.Unprecedented access through technology allows new quest takers in the Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy to access all sorts of information and guidance. Imagine if podcasts or blogs were available during the time of Shakespeare, Jung, or Edison. Can you envision if Abraham Lincoln could have tweeted out his thoughts and ideas while President? What if Einstein hosted a long format podcast?The great thinkers of our time now share their opinions, ideas, and concerns through a broad breadth of technology that is available to learn and apply. Online classes, podcasts, and blogs offer a tremendous amount of free advice and guidance. Even most of the major universities have their full curriculum, including class readings, lectures, notes, and even tests available online to everyone. The only thing not free and available is the degree. In this New Economy, subject matter experts in all types of fields will offer up their rich knowledge on a topic and will morph into the role of mentors.Let‚Äôs take learning to meditate as an example. There are several mentors available in this area, ranging from people who pioneered bringing meditation and mindfulness to the west like Joseph Goldstein to skeptical adopters/proponents like Dan Harris. There are also many free phone apps designed to guide both beginners and long-time meditators. You can even listen to a podcast to hear the Dalai Llama provide his perspective and guidance on taking up a practice of daily meditation. The comprehensive information on meditation offered up in detail across several methods by the experts in the field presents unprecedented nurturing support to a once-elusive mental exercise.Meditation is just one example where mentors are now commonly available to people interested in taking up the practice. Here is a list of some mentors available to assist in other personal transformations:Another common theme in these journeys is that people looking for personal development reach out to companions and sidekicks to aid in their adventures. In many cases, for profound personal transformation to take place, the traveler or hero is pushed to their brink and often gets to an ‚Äúall is lost‚Äù moment before a tangible change occurs. These assistants in the quest play a critical part in that they bring a specific set of skills to the journey that aids the traveler through this challenging and soul-searching time.Not too long ago, a sidekick was hard to find and was left to chance meetings. Sidekicks needed to be living in the same locale. It required a fair amount of luck to find just the right person that had the specific skills necessary to help in the journey. The details of how Alexander Graham Bell met Watson or how Warren Buffett met Charlie Munger are great origin stories that could be movies unto themselves.In the Hero‚Äôs Journey economy, technology will change all that. The internet, mobile phones, social media, and collaboration tools make finding and working with a sidekick on a project much more accessible and efficient. Specialized freelancers now stand at the ready and are available to assist on short notice and with flexible pricing models based on the project. Web designers, life coaches, fitness trainers, and meditation guides all can be easily found in minutes. Reviews, ratings, and comments from other clients allow people to tap into the wisdom of crowds for a personalized fit. In this new economy, people on a quest may not even meet or speak with their sidekick. The guidance, assistance, and skill transfer can occur virtually through YouTube, podcasts, and blogs.Technology also provides easy access to experts and the latest ideas on a specific transformation. Alex Guerro, Tom Brady‚Äôs fitness guru, offers online assistance to individuals using the same techniques and tools that have helped Tom Brady become the greatest football player of all time and play in the NFL for 20 years.YouTube provides access to famous instructors in areas of personal development and for all skill levels for free. Training on a Peloton Bike includes access to exceptional spin instructors and allows you to build rivalries with people halfway around the world all from your home.In this new Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy, many times the sidekicks and assistants helping on a transformation may not even be human.Next-generation sidekicks will tap into vast reservoirs of data to offer personalized coaching and advice based on personal readings and progress against the journeys. For example, Headspace, the company behind the successful meditation app, has behavioral scientists, meditation experts, and rich data collected from all users and combines this information to optimize meditation results for the individual. Over time, Headspace is getting smarter about how people new to meditation either succeed or fail in building a mindfulness practice. Headspace can quickly identify the personality type and tweak the recommended path for that new user, essentially working behind the scenes to hack the process to ensure transformational success.These individual apps will soon converge through the use of AI and machine learning to create uber sidekicks that can provide comprehensive transformational guidance and expertise across a full host of criteria. Transformational sidekicks that consistently provide successful change outcomes will become the new global brands of this Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy. These brands will take on a unique personal relationship as a trusted advisor and lifelong companion to individuals. Products and services not in this inner circle may find themselves as a less relevant commodity or may not be needed at all.In the Hero‚Äôs Journey Economy, the individual will be the product. Mentors and Sidekicks will be trusted advisors and counselors to these personal journeys. Marketers will rush to tie their branded products and experiences to these expert counselors. Mentors and Sidekicks to transformation over time will either, intentionally or unintentionally, become the new global brands.",26/07/2019,0,0,12,5,537,440,4,4,0,19,177
3 Important Traits for Marketing Leaders,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/3-important-traits-for-marketing-leaders-ada6a631b0fc,Minutes,2400,5,999,"Just like any other executive position, marketing leadership roles are unique in what they require from those who fill them. Ultimately, what‚Äôs required of these essential positions comes down to the three ‚ÄúI‚Äôs‚Äù: Inform, Influence, and most importantly, Inspire. However, I believe that every executive leader should focus on these three traits.The last ‚ÄúI,‚Äù especially, is imperative, and it‚Äôs also multifaceted. You have to inspire both externally ‚Äî by way of your words, your verve, and your vigor ‚Äî as well as intrinsically, by way of things like your company‚Äôs mission and its core values. This itself requires a certain kind of emotional connection, which is what ultimately sticks with people. After all, if you touch the mind, an employee or user will remember it for a while. But if you touch the heart, they‚Äôll remember it forever.Of course, for those aspiring to become a leader in the marketing field or in their company, the question then becomes: how exactly does one inform, influence, and inspire so effectively? It starts with developing these three behavioral traits.A primary way you‚Äôll inspire both users and the teams you manage will be through the energy, passion, and devotion you convey day-in and day-out. (This goes back to the last ‚ÄúI‚Äù from above.)You must have a passion for making a difference, along with a passion for inspiring others. You need to be able to instill a passion for your company‚Äôs mission within your employees. You need to build belief. To do that, you must be passionate yourself. Your belief in what you‚Äôre doing ‚Äî as well as in your company and yourself ‚Äî must be genuine and powerful.Now, having and conveying passion is not simply a matter of waving your arms or yelling into a microphone during all-hands meetings. Personally, I try to convey my passion (and inspire it in others) more naturally. I do this by sharing real-world examples of customers for whom our product has made an actual difference, or by celebrating folks whose work internally has directly led to improvements or positive customer outcomes. I let the success of others, in this sense, exemplify my own passion.In practice, marketing depends on attention to detail. Clearly, it‚Äôs important when it comes to copy, branding, and developing logos. It‚Äôs also necessary when using data to determine what resonates with users and what sort of positioning compels users into your desired outcome, as well as in understanding the efficacy of a new campaign.But attention to detail also allows you to understand your customers more operationally, and the journey they‚Äôll take when interacting with your marketing materials and products.To market your product or service effectively, you have to know what personas you‚Äôre selling to and what market you‚Äôre targeting. Are you selling to C-suite executives, IT directors, or everyday consumers? Each gravitates to and identifies with different kinds of content. Some want videos, and others need researched whitepapers. Knowing those differences, down to the seemingly minute specifics, is what sets effective leaders apart from the rest. You must ‚Äúknow thy audience.‚ÄùThe same is true, meanwhile, when it comes to building customer loyalty. You need to pay attention not only to what your metrics suggest about your strategy for acquiring contacts and qualified leads, but also to what the details reflect about your ability to turn those leads into customers who love your product.If this sounds like a lot to manage or juggle at once, that‚Äôs because it is. However, as a leader, it‚Äôs critical you understand how all these points intertwine. Together, they‚Äôll help you make sense of the big picture to deploy the appropriate strategies needed to achieve success.Although it may seem counterintuitive, a marketing leader must possess technical aptitude in the traditional stereotypical views of marketing folk. You have to understand how to use tools like CRMs and MATs, of course ‚Äî many marketers sadly only exploit a small percentage of these tools‚Äô operational capability. In addition, you also need to thoroughly understand your product or service. You need to be able to translate the technical utility of your product into layman‚Äôs terms for different audiences. (Mark Lewis, CEO of Violin Systems, did a great job of this in using his freeway analogy to explain matters of bandwidth, latency, and input-output performance per second.)This, ultimately, is an essential part of the gig. It‚Äôs a matter of credibility. You need to be able to explain your product inside and out. You have to connect the dots from technology to product, and also show the value delivered up and down the business stack.So, how can marketing leaders go about building their technical aptitude and achieving this in-depth level of product knowledge? I did so personally at a number of companies, and most recently at Violin Systems, by talking not only with the C-level execs, but also with the engineers, the IT team, etc.It‚Äôs important to obtain these different levels of understanding. For example, C-level executives will give you a different explanation of your product ‚Äî more high-level ‚Äî than an engineer or storage admin will. The former might tell you, ‚ÄúViolin is a great solution for transactional applications.‚Äù Then, the latter will tell you about how, ‚Äúour architecture ensures a level of persistence performance that‚Äôs critical in terms of user experience.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôll give you answers in different languages. And as a leader, you need to be able to speak all of them.At the end of the day, although the work of a marketing and product leader is varied, these are the essential elements of it. Ultimately, it comes down to leading by example. You need to show the people who work for you how informed they need to be about the product you‚Äôre selling, how attentive they need to be to the small details, and what kind of passion they should bring to the work. I‚Äôm reminded of a John Quincy Adams quote: ‚ÄúIf your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.‚Äù",25/07/2019,0,0,2,5,1050,700,1,0,0,2,166
5 Habits That Will Help You Write More,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/5-habits-that-will-help-you-write-more-a819cef5476f,Minutes,2400,10,1879,"You are your biggest asset. You are also your biggest obstacle.I have two questions for you.How successful do you want to be? And how willing are you to do what it takes to become that successful?How you answer these questions will likely dictate your level of success.Often, we see people on the other side of the hump, after they‚Äôve found success. From so-called overnight sensations to the Next Big Thing, when people pop on our radars, seldom do we see the hard work that went into their climb. We think they caught a lucky break or knew the right people. Yes, luck plays a part in success, but you can make your own luck by working hard and networking.We see the novelist who made it huge on Amazon when last month we didn‚Äôt even know her name. What we didn‚Äôt see were all the countless hours she spent hammering away at stories, writing book after book, perfecting her formula until she found the one that caught the attention of readers and publishers.What others don‚Äôt see often makes the biggest difference.This post is about work habits. With hard work, you can accomplish nearly anything.You are your biggest asset.You are also your biggest obstacle.Bad habits are formed by a slow and steady accumulation of mindless minutes. As a million years of rainfall smooth the slope of a mountain, so will a million misplaced moments warp your best intentions. Fortunately, you can unlearn bad habits and replace them with good ones that will propel you forward. But you‚Äôll never unlock the door unless you look for the key.Start by searching for the reason in your routine. Finding the why in what you do is an excellent precursor to rooting out the undesirable. If a bad habit is built through a sequence of negative actions, a good one can be shaped by stringing opposite elements in the opposing direction.This post is filled with thoughts on the work habits I‚Äôve found most critical as a writer. What works for me may not work for you. That‚Äôs the problem with reading anyone else‚Äôs list of life hacks. You don‚Äôt need a How To; you need a Why Should I?. It‚Äôs the universal thread that‚Äôs important: your need to change and desire to do so. When want meets willing, there‚Äôs no limit to how high you can climb. Start here, but make your own rules. Just make sure you follow them.Writers don‚Äôt have enough time in the day. Unfortunately, we all share the same hours and will never get a minute more. You probably know a few people who rise before the sun each day, bustling with energy and enthusiasm. You enjoy your pillow time, but are also envious of how much that person seems to get done and how energetic they usually are, despite rising so early.So how can you get up earlier?For some people, getting up early is natural. Maybe it won‚Äôt be for you. Fortunately, you‚Äôre a creature of habit, and even if it‚Äôs hard at first, you‚Äôll find that diligence will lead to change.Just remember: no matter how early you manage to get up, never start your day with email!Hitting my inbox first thing in the morning has cost me more time, money, and momentum than any other mistake I‚Äôve made, online or off.Too often, starting your day with email leads to disregarding the necessary cogs of your career and slipping false urgency to the front of the line. Dip into email first, and you might end up populating the first part of your day with someone else‚Äôs problems. Don‚Äôt ignore others‚Äô needs or always put yourself first, but fail to prioritize your day, and it will float away like leaves on a flooded street.Many people, especially writers, treat their inbox as a task list. Answering emails gives you license to lose focus, forces you into reaction instead of pro-action, and leaves you with more work. Worse, it‚Äôs usually the type of work that keeps you running in place. Rather than actively setting your agenda, you react to items as they arrive, regardless of actual priority.Email is a remarkable means of communication. I couldn‚Äôt run my business without it. I communicated with my business partner through email every day for a year and a half before we ever met in person. I love email, but I‚Äôve surrendered a ridiculous amount of time to its whims, and I don‚Äôt want the same thing to happen to you.So how should you start your day?By slaying the dragon and doing the one thing you absolutely do not want to do.Have you ever put something off for days, weeks, or even months because you hated the thought of doing it? Then, when you finally had no choice, you realized it only took a couple of hours (or even minutes!) and wasn‚Äôt nearly as awful as you expected? Every writer has tasks they dislike, and work grinds to a halt when they try to avoid them.The simple solution is to start with your most undesirable task first. This will help you clear your desk of the undesirable and leave you with the motivation that will make it easy to fly through the remainder of your day.Everything is easier when you are organized and focused. This is especially true for jobs you don‚Äôt want to do in the first place. Clear your mind and workspace of distractions. Turn off the phone (unless making calls is your dreaded duty), and put away everything except your required materials. Shut down all unnecessary applications, including email and your web browser.Don‚Äôt sabotage yourself with distractions or deceive yourself into thinking you‚Äôll get more done by multitasking. (Much recent neuroscience has shown that multitasking decreases the quality of your work and drastically increases the amount of time it takes to finish any one task, so don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you can do more than one thing at a time!)Start by making a simple outline of everything you need to clear the project from your plate, but don‚Äôt let yourself drown in details. Sketch your to-do‚Äôs in a logical order, so you know where to start and what to do after finishing each element. Look at the big picture as you complete each step and focus on getting the critical pieces in place rather than getting bogged down in minutiae. Use placeholders and side notes, which will keep you moving forward instead of getting stuck.Once done, give yourself a well-deserved break. Rewards are motivating and allow you time to recharge before moving on to your next task.While it‚Äôs smart to start with your worst tasks, it isn‚Äôt necessary to do it every day.Depending on the project, try consolidating dreaded tasks (billing, coming up with article ideas, pitching editors) and designate one morning per week or month to get it all done. Just make sure you make your morning about you and do the small things that will move you forward, even if you‚Äôre only draining your brain in daily pages.Most writers want to keep a journal, but it‚Äôs a habit that easily slips through the cracks. The modern writer has few excuses. The ability to store your fleeting thoughts, organized by date and safely harbored on your hard drive is worth consistent practice. Your thoughts are treasures. You never know what you will think next or where it may lead your life or business.The best thing about keeping a journal is that it will one day lead you down a road of remembrance, reminding you of who you were and once wanted to be.There are no rules in keeping a journal. You decide how often to empty your brain, how long you allow your thoughts to run, and how carefully you keep to your schedule. Benefits are countless, from a running record of your life to writing that stimulates ideas for future projects. Stay invested, and the rewards are numerous. Unfortunately, with the hectic fray of modern life, writing for yourself isn‚Äôt always a priority.Here are a few ways to make it a little easier:The questions themselves don‚Äôt matter so much, but you need a spark if you want to make fire.At first, use your journal to ground you. Once you find your rhythm, it‚Äôs the best planning tool you could possibly have.How many nights a week do you plop on the sofa to watch ‚Äúa little‚Äù TV, then suddenly realize it‚Äôs 11 p.m. You didn‚Äôt read the book you wanted to read, work out like you said you would, call your friend you‚Äôve not talked to in a month, or accomplish any of the dozens of things you say you want to do, yet somehow never have the time.Television is stealing your minutes. Even worse, too much passive media consumption can cripple your imagination, decrease your quality sleep and exercise, and pull you from the pursuit of more productive activities.Unplugging the cable can be one of the best things you ever do for your life as a writer. I unplugged my cable because we were living on credit cards and couldn‚Äôt justify the expense, but it was one of the best things I ever did.Imagine what you could do with all the hours you once spent passively watching TV.You could spend a couple hours each night reading a wide variety of literature to feed your mind and spirit. It‚Äôs amazing how many writers neglect to read and are then surprised to find their creative wells running dry.Without the burden of TV, you could spend more time in the world, socializing and observing. It‚Äôs hard to write well when all your input comes from the blue glow of the Big Happy Box.While some shows are incredibly well written, featuring strong characters and dialogue, even the best miss out on the subtleties you‚Äôll notice when you spend more time with people. Even if you‚Äôre introverted, you‚Äôll benefit by spending an hour or two each week engaged in people-watching.To tweak Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs famous quote, ‚ÄúEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a writer healthy, wealthy, and wise.‚Äù Your mind and body are more connected than you may realize. While some artists manage to destroy their bodies and still produce genius, why would you want that for yourself?Don‚Äôt swear off all onscreen entertainment; I haven‚Äôt. There are plenty of high-quality series that are an absolute joy to watch, teaching me a lot about pacing, dialogue, foreshadowing, and other literary devices. Being out of touch with popular culture is never a good idea when your job is relating to readers, especially online.Even a bit of trashy television now and then can be good for a writer‚Äôs soul. The producers and writers behind some of the worst reality television understand how to appeal to audiences in a way most writers could only dream of. We all need brain candy, whether it‚Äôs beach blanket romances or Jersey Shore. The trick is to plan your viewing, then once it‚Äôs over, get up and do something else.Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre home free if you never watch television, but still spend every night surfing the Web. Every writer needs time away from whatever hypnotic glow has their attention. Unplugging will give you the time you need to recharge, get inspired, and take care of your physical, mental, and spiritual self.",25/07/2019,1,0,10,4,1050,700,1,3,0,2,348
Identifying the Sources of Winter Air Pollution in Bangkok Part II,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/identifying-the-sources-of-winter-air-pollution-in-bangkok-part-ii-72539f9b767a,Worasom Kundhikanjana,235,9,1714,"In the previous blog, I looked at the winter air pollution in Bangkok. The main source of pollution comes from particles smaller than 2.5 micrometer (PM 2.5 particles). These particles are smaller than the width of a human hair and can easily enter our bodies, even making their way into our blood. Last week (March 17, 2019), many provinces in the northern part of Thailand had the worst Air Quality Index (AQI) in the world due to particle pollution. So far, no long term solution has been proposed because the source of the PM 2.5 particle pollution has not been clearly pinpointed. In this notebook, I identify the sources of high PM 2.5 particles in Bangkok through a machine learning model. The code can be found in my GitHub page.There are three major theories regarding the source of air pollution in Bangkok: (1) The temperature inversion effect where cold air along with pollution is trapped close to the surface of the Earth. This theory was proposed by the government at the beginning of the 2019 winter season. The government blamed emission from old diesel engines for the pollution. (2) Agricultural burning, either locally or from surrounding provinces. During winter, a lot of open agricultural burning occurs throughout the country. Some officials have tried to tackle the air pollution problem by reducing open agricultural burning. (3) Pollution from other provinces or countries. Some NGOs blamed the pollution on near by power plants.My analysis procedure is as follows: Build a machine learning model(ML) to predict the air pollution level in Bangkok using environmental factor such as weather, traffic index, and fire maps. Include date-time features such as local hour, and weekday versus weekend in the model to capture other effects from human activities. Identify dominant sources of pollution using the feature of importance provided by the ML model.If the source of the pollution is local, then the AQI will depend on factors such as weather patterns (wind speed, humidity, average temperature), local traffic, and hour of day. If the pollution is from agricultural burning, the AQI will depend on active fires with some time lag to account for geographical separation. Fire activities are included based on the distance from Bangkok. On the other hand, if the pollution not correlated with the fire map, then the model should put more weight on weather patterns, such as wind direction and wind speed.Here are a list of features I considered and their data sources:Let me first walk through all the features included in the model.Farmers in Southeast Asia pick January ‚Äî March as their burning season. For the north and northeastern provinces in Thailand, these burning activities are large enough to make these provinces among the most polluted places in the world during this time. For Bangkok, one might argue that because the region is heavily industrial rather than agricultural, it may not be affected as much by agricultural burning. But this is not the case.Because of the tiny size of PM 2.5 particles, they remain suspended in the atmosphere for prolonged periods and can travel over very long distances. From the weather data, the average wind speed is 10 km/hour. The reported PM 2.5 level is a rolling average over 24 hours. A rough estimate is that the current PM 2.5 reading may be from sources as far as 240 km away. The picture below shows the fire map measured by NASA‚Äôs satellites, indicative of agricultural burning, on Jan 8, 2018 and on Feb 8, 2018. The yellow circle indicates the area within 240 km of Bangkok. The number of fires on Jan 8, which has an acceptable level of pollution, is much lower than the number of fires on Feb 8, which has an unhealthy level of pollution.In fact, the fire pattern closely aligns with the PM 2.5 pattern.The temperature inversion effect often occurs during winter because the temperature is cooler near the ground. The hotter air on top traps the cool air from flowing. This stagnant atmospheric condition allows the PM 2.5 particles to remain suspended in the air for longer. On the other hand, higher humidity or rain will help remove particles from the atmosphere. This is one reason why in the past when the air pollution was high, the government has sprayed water in the air. Unfortunately, this mitigation does not appear to be effective, since the volume of water is minuscule compared to actual rain. How much influence does weather pattern have on air pollution? Let‚Äôs compare the weather in winter versus other seasons.Temperature, wind speed and humidity are all lower in winter, but not by a large amount. Now, let‚Äôs look at the relationship of each of these with the PM 2.5 level.Higher temperature (which disrupts the temperature inversion effect), wind speed and humidity have a negative correlation with the pollution level.On windy days, the pollution is clearly better. The median of the distribution for PM 2.5 levels is lower on windy days compared to on days without wind.In fact, the pollution level also depends on the wind direction, as seen in this plot. I selected only four major wind directions for simplicity.On the days where the wind comes from the south, the pollution level is lower likely because the Thai gulf is to the south of Bangkok. The clean ocean wind improves the air quality. Wind from the other three directions pass overland. However, having any wind is better than the stagnant atmospheric conditions on calm days.The shift in the median PM 2.5 level is smaller between rainy days and days with no rain. There are fewer rainy days during the winter season, so the data is somewhat noisy, but a difference can be observed in the cumulative density function.One of the sources of PM 2.5 particles is car engine exhaust. While campaigning for more public transportation usage is in general good for the environment, the effectiveness toward reducing PM 2.5 pollution is unclear. Here is why.We have seen that PM 2.5 levels are related to the time of day. The pollution is lower around 3 pm, but remains high during the night time. When plotted against the traffic data, the relationship with the pollution level is very noisy. There does not seem to be a strong correlation.Including the time of day and weekday versus weekend information into the model might make the relationship more clear.The current PM 2.5 value can also depend on the previous value. The partial autocorrelation plot below shows a strong correlation at 1 hr time lag, which means the PM 2.5 level is an autoregression process. Thus I include the 24 hour average values in the model, with the restriction that the model is only allowed to see the previous value for future predictions. The importance of this feature should be directly related to how long the particles stay in the atmosphere.The picture below show a dedrogram of all input features calculated from Spearman correlation. The dendrogram helps to identify redundant features that can be removed from the model. The number of fires within various distances and the level of PM 2.5 are closely related. Other features are further away. I ended up using all of these features in the model.To identify the major contributions to the pollution, I used a random forest regression to fit the model because of its simplicity and ease of interpretation. During hyper-parameter tuning, 25% of the data was allocated for the validation set. The model was retrained again using the entire dataset. The model achieves 0.99 R-squared on the training set. Since the purpose of this study is to understand the sources of the air pollution in the past, I focused on the training set. The plot below ranks the importance of each contributing factor. The importance is calculated from the decrease in the R-squared values upon permuting the column, and re-normalizing the sum of all columns.As expected the previous pollution level is the most important predictor. This is followed by the number of fires from the closest to the furthest. The number of fires as far away as 720 km has more influence on the air quality than the local humidity, traffic, or even rain. The hour of day is a more important predictor than the traffic index. Among the weather features, humidity is the most important feature.The influence of each feature is illustrated below using a tree interpreter for the data on Jan 13, 2019 at 8 am with 96 PM 2.5 level.We start with the average value of 26. The PM 2.5 level for the previous hour was 62, thus the model adds a value 20. There were 150 fires within a 240 km radius, thus the model adds 10 to the pollution level. The value is now 56. There are 1649 fires between 240-480 km, and 896 fires between 480-720 km, and the model adds a value of 9 and 8 respectively. The low wind speed and the morning rush hour (8 am) adds 8 to the model. These six top factors account for 81 out of the total 96 predicted for the PM 2.5 level. The remaining features to the right are less important and thus increase the predicted pollution value less.On a good day such as Feb 2, 2019 at 7 pm the PM 2.5 level was 10. The pollution level in the hour before was low, thus the model subtracts a value of 10. There were still a lot of fires in the area, and the model adds a value of 2. The wind speed was high, reducing the value by 2. The weather and traffic were good. The combination of many factors results in a low predicted PM 2.5 level of 10.The PM 2.5 level has a complex relationship with various factors: number of fires, weather patterns, and traffic. But this analysis confirms the suspicion that many people have ‚Äî agricultural burning is the root cause of PM 2.5 pollution in Thailand. Burning activities as far as 720 km away from Bangkok, an area which extends into Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, can cause air problems in Bangkok. Solving this problem will not be easy. It will require a collaborative international effort among the Southeast Asian countries.I leave you with a fire map from March 17, 2019, one of the worst days ever!",31/03/2019,15,0,2,0,552,365,16,1,0,5,772
The problem with data science job postings,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-problem-with-data-science-job-postings-8a3542f38724,Jeremie Harris,122000,5,728,"Every once in a while, you notice something that you realize you probably should have noticed a long time ago. You start to see it everywhere. You wonder why more people aren‚Äôt talking about it.For me, ‚Äúevery once in a while‚Äù was yesterday when I was scrolling through the #jobs channel in the SharpestMinds Slack workspace, and the ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is a big problem in the data science industry that I really don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre taking seriously enough: the vast majority of data science job descriptions do not convey the actual requirements of the position they‚Äôre advertising.How do I know this? For one, quite a few of the jobs posted to our internal board included notes from the users (usually SharpestMinds mentors) who posted them, saying things like, ‚ÄúI know the posting says they‚Äôre looking for X and Y, but they‚Äôre actually fine with Z.‚Äù As often as not I‚Äôd also get direct messages from them saying the same thing.In other words, when senior data scientists are called upon to recruit ‚Äúfor real‚Äù, their first move is often to throw away the job posting altogether.This is not good, for several reasons. First, a misleading job description means that recruiters get a *ton* of irrelevant applications, and that candidates waste a *ton* of time applying to irrelevant positions. But there‚Äôs another problem: job descriptions are the training labels that any good aspiring data scientist will use to prioritize their personal and technical skills development.Despite the obvious downsides of these mangled job postings, companies keep putting them out there, so a very natural question to ask is: why? Why are job postings so confusing (in that they fail to clearly specify the skills they expect from a candidate), or so outrageously over-reaching (‚Äúlooking for a machine learning engineer with 10 years‚Äô experience in deep learning‚Ä¶‚Äù)?There are many reasons. For one, companies make hiring decisions based on a candidate‚Äôs (perceived) ability to solve a real problem that they actually have. Because there are many ways to solve any given data science problem, it can be hard to narrow down the job description to a specific set of technical skills or libraries. That‚Äôs why it usually makes sense to put in an application for a company if you think you can solve the problems they have, even if you don‚Äôt know the specific tools they ask for.Another possible reason is that many companies don‚Äôt actually know what they want ‚Äî especially companies with relatively new data science teams ‚Äî either because the early stage of their data science effort forces everyone to be a jack of all trades, or because they lack the expertise they need to even know what problems they have, and who can help solve them. If you come across an oddly non-specific posting, it‚Äôs worth taking the time to figure out which bucket it belongs to, since the former can be a great experience builder, whereas the latter can be a recipe for disaster.But perhaps the most important reason is that job postings are often written by recruiters, who are not remotely technical. This has the unfortunate side-effect of resulting in occasionally incoherent asks (‚ÄúMust have 10+ years‚Äô experience with deep learning‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äú‚Ä¶including natural language toolkits, such as OpenCV‚Ä¶‚Äù) or asks that no human being could possibly satisfy.The net result of this job qualifications circus is that I regularly get questions from our mentees about whether they‚Äôre qualified for an opening, despite their having read all the information available on the internet about that position. Those questions are actually surprisingly consistent ‚Äî so much so that I think it‚Äôs worth listing the answers to the most common ones here, in the form of simple rules you can follow to make sure you‚Äôre applying to the right roles (and not being scared away by fake requirements):None of these rules are universally applicable, of course: the odd company will insist on hiring only candidates who meet all their stated requirements, and others will be particularly interested in people who know framework X, and will disregard people who can solve similar problems, but with different tools. But because there‚Äôs no way to know that from job descriptions alone (unless they‚Äôre explicit about it), your best bet is almost always to bet on yourself, and throw your hat in the ring.If you want to connect, you can find me on Twitter at @jeremiecharris!",30/03/2019,7,0,1,1,1024,683,1,1,0,3,1500
Predictive Maintenance: detect Faults from Sensors with CNN,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-maintenance-detect-faults-from-sensors-with-cnn-6c6172613371,Marco Cerliani,5400,6,857,"In Machine Learning the topic of Predictive Maintenance is becoming more popular with the passage of time. The challenges are not easy and very heterogenous: it‚Äôs useful to have a good knowledge of the domain or to be in touch with people who know how the underlying system works. For these reasons when a data scientist engages himself in this new field of battle has to follow a linear and rational approach, keeping in mind that the easiest solutions are always the better ones.In this article, we will take a look at a classification problem. We will apply a simple but very powerful model made with CNN in Keras and we will try to give a visual explanation of our results.I decided to take a dataset from the evergreen UCI repository (Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems).The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.We can image to have a hydraulic pipe system which cyclically receives impulse due to e.g. the transition of particular type of liquid in the pipeline. This phenomenon lasts 60 seconds and was measured by different sensors (Sensor Physical quantity Unit Sampling rate, PS1 Pressure bar, PS2 Pressure bar, PS3 Pressure bar, PS4 Pressure bar, PS5 Pressure bar, PS6 Pressure bar, EPS1 Motor power, FS1 Volume flow, FS2 Volume flow, TS1 Temperature, TS2 Temperature, TS3 Temperature, TS4 Temperature, VS1 Vibration, CE Cooling efficiency, CP Cooling power, SE Efficiency factor) with different Hz frequencies.Our purpose is to predict the condition of four hydraulic components which compose the pipeline. These target condition values are annotated in the form of integer values (easy to encode) and say us if a particular component is close to fail for every cycle.The values measured by each sensor are available in a specific txt file, wherein each row represents a cycle in the form of a time series.I‚Äôve decided to take into account the data coming from the Temperature Sensors (TS1, TS2, TS3, TS4) measured with a frequency of 1 Hz (60 observations for every single cycle).For the first cycle we have these time series from the Temperature Sensors:In order to capture interesting features and not obvious correlations from the series at our disposal, we have decided to adopt a 1D CNN. This kind of model suits very well the analysis of time sequences of sensors and imposes to reshape the data in short fixed-length segments.Developing this workflow, I took inspiration from this post which adopts a very useful approach. I picked the same CNN described on the Keras website and refreshed the parameters. The model was built to classify the status of the Cooler component giving as input only the time series of temperature in array format (t_periods x n_sensor for every single cycle).In this case, with only 10 epochs we are able to achieve incredible results!Making the prediction on the test data the model reaches an ACCURACY of 0.9909%.KPIs in each class are awesome! This result is particularly important for class 3 (component Cooler ‚Äò close to total failure‚Äô) because in this way we are able to detect and prevent possible faults in the system.If we want to have a general overview of the system status and see the incredible goodness of our model, might be useful to see a graphic representation. To reach this target we reutilize the CNN that we‚Äôve built above to make a decoder and extract clever features from the time series of every single cycle. With Keras this is possible in one single line of code:The new model is a decoder which receives as input data in the same format as the NN we utilized for the classification task (t_periods x n_sensor for every single cycle) and returns ‚Äòprediction‚Äô in form of embeddings coming from the GlobalAveragePooling1D layer with relative dimension (a row of 160 embedding variables for every single cycle).Computing the prediction with our encoder on the test data, adopting a technique to reduce dimensions (like PCA or T-SNE), and plotting the results we can see this magic:WOOW!!! This graph tells the truth! Each dot represents a cycle in the test set and the relative color is the target class of the Cooler condition. It‚Äôs possible to see how the distinction among target values of the Cooler component is well defined. This approach is a key indicator of the performance of our model.In this post, we try to solve a problem of Predictive Maintenance, in the form of a classification task for time series with CNN. A strong model with impressive performance was developed. We try to give also a visual representation of the results. It‚Äôs important to underline the power of CNN not only in the case of prediction but also as an instrument to detect invisible relations among data.If you are interested in the topic, I suggest:CHECK MY GITHUB REPOKeep in touch: Linkedin",30/03/2019,4,5,6,2,831,525,4,1,0,10,380
"Cleaning, Analyzing, and Visualizing Survey Data in Python",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/cleaning-analyzing-and-visualizing-survey-data-in-python-42747a13c713,Charlene Chambliss,444,10,1812,"If you work in data at a D2C startup, there‚Äôs a good chance you will be asked to look at survey data at least once. And since SurveyMonkey is one of the most popular survey platforms out there, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll be SurveyMonkey data.The way SurveyMonkey exports data is not necessarily ready for analysis right out of the box, but it‚Äôs pretty close. Here I‚Äôll demonstrate a few examples of questions you might want to ask of your survey data, and how to extract those answers quickly. We‚Äôll even write a few functions to make our lives easier when plotting future questions.We‚Äôll be using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to make sense of our data. I used Mockaroo to generate this data; specifically, for the survey question fields, I used ""Custom List"" and entered in the appropriate fields. You could achieve the same effect by using random.choice in the random module, but I found it easier to let Mockaroo create the whole thing for me. I then tweaked the data in Excel so that it mirrored the structure of a SurveyMonkey export.Your first reaction to this might be ‚ÄúUgh. It‚Äôs horrible.‚Äù I mean, the column names didn‚Äôt read in properly, there are a ton of NaNs, instead of numerical representations like 0/1 or 1/2/3/4/5 we have the actual text answers in each cell‚Ä¶And should we actually be reading this in with a MultiIndex?But don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as bad as you might think. And we‚Äôre going to ignore MultiIndexes in this post. (Nobody really likes working with them anyway.) The team needs those insights ASAP ‚Äî so we‚Äôll come up with some hacky solutions.First order of business: we‚Äôve been asked to find how the answers to these questions vary by age group. But age is just an age--we don't have a column for age groups! Well, luckily for us, we can pretty easily define a function to create one.But if we try to run it like this, we‚Äôll get an error! That‚Äôs because we have that first row, and its value for age is the word ‚Äúage‚Äù instead of a number. Since the first step is to convert each age to an int, this will fail.We need to remove that row from the DataFrame, but it‚Äôll be useful for us later when we rename columns, so we‚Äôll save it as a separate variable.You will notice that, since removing headers, we've now lost some information when looking at the survey data by itself. Ideally, you will have a list of the questions and their options that were asked in the survey, provided to you by whoever wants the analysis. If not, you should keep a separate way to reference this info in a document or note that you can look at while working.OK, now let‚Äôs apply the age_group function to get our age_group column.Great. Next, let‚Äôs subset the data to focus on just the first question. How do the answers to this first question vary by age group?Great. We have the answers in a variable now. But when we go to plot this data, it‚Äôs not going to look very good, because of the misnamed columns. Let‚Äôs write up a quick function to make renaming the columns simple:Remember headers from earlier? We can use it to create our new_names_list for renaming.It‚Äôs already an array, so we can just pass it right in, or we can rename it first for readability.Isn‚Äôt that so much nicer to look at? Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre almost to the part where we get some insights.Notice how groupby and other aggregation functions ignore NaNs automatically. That makes our lives significantly easier.Let‚Äôs say we also don‚Äôt really care about analyzing under-30 customers right now, so we‚Äôll plot only the other age groups.OK, this is all well and good, but the 60+ group has more people in it than the other groups, and so it‚Äôs hard to make a fair comparison. What do we do? We can plot each age group in a separate plot, and then compare the distributions.‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you might think. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to write the code for 4 different plots.‚ÄùWell of course not! Who has time for that? Let‚Äôs write another function to do it for us.I believe it was Jenny Bryan, in her wonderful talk ‚ÄúCode Smells and Feels,‚Äù who first tipped me off to the following:If you find yourself copying and pasting code and just changing a few values, you really ought to just write a function.This has been a great guide for me in deciding when it is and isn‚Äôt worth it to write a function for something. A rule of thumb I like to use is that if I would be copying and pasting more than 3 times, I write a function.There are also benefits other than convenience to this approach, such as that it:(All of which improve your programming skills and make the people who need to read your code happier!)This is, of course, generated data from a uniform distribution, and we would thus not expect to see any significant differences between groups. Hopefully your own survey data will be more interesting.Next, let‚Äôs address another format of question. In this one, we need to see how interested each age group is in a given benefit. Happily, these questions are actually easier to deal with than the former type. Let‚Äôs take a look:And look, since this is a small DataFrame, age_group is appended already and we won't have to add it.Cool. Now we have the subsetted data, but we can‚Äôt just aggregate it by count this time like we could with the other question ‚Äî the last question had NaNs that would be excluded to give the true count for that response, but with this one, we would just get the number of responses for each age group overall:This is definitely not what we want! The point of the question is to understand how interested the different age groups are, and we need to preserve that information. All this tells us is how many people in each age group responded to the question.So what do we do? One way to go would be to re-encode these responses numerically. But what if we want to preserve the relationship on an even more granular level? If we encode numerically, we can take the median and average of each age group‚Äôs level of interest. But what if what we‚Äôre really interested in is the specific percentage of people per age group who chose each interest level? It‚Äôd be easier to convey that info in a barplot, with the text preserved.That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do next. And ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to write another function.Quick note to new learners: Most people won‚Äôt say this explicitly, but let me be clear on how visualizations are often made. Generally speaking, it is a highly iterative process. Even the most experienced data scientists don‚Äôt just write up a plot with all of these specifications off the top of their head.Generally, you start with .plot(kind='bar'), or similar depending on the plot you want, and then you change size, color maps, get the groups properly sorted using order=, specify whether the labels should be rotated, and set x- or y-axis labels invisible, and more, depending on what you think is best for whoever will be using the visualizations.So don‚Äôt be intimidated by the long blocks of code you see when people are making plots. They‚Äôre usually created over a span of minutes while testing out different specifications, not by writing perfect code from scratch in one go.Now we can plot another 2x2 for each benefit broken out by age group. But we‚Äôd have to do that for all 4 benefits! Again: who has time for that? Instead, we‚Äôll loop over each benefit, and each age group within each benefit, using a couple of for loops. But if you're interested, I'd challenge you to refactor this into a function if you happen to have many questions that are formatted like this.Success! And if we wanted to export each individual set of plots, we would simply add the line plt.savefig('{}_interest_by_age.png'.format(benefit)), and matplotlib would automatically save a beautifully sharp rendering of each set of plots.This makes it especially easy for folks on other teams to use your findings; you can simply export them to a plots folder, and people can browse the images and be able to drag and drop them right into a PowerPoint presentation or other report.These could use a tad more padding, so if I were to do this again, I would increase the allowed height for the figure slightly.Let‚Äôs do one more example: numerically encoding the benefits, as we mentioned earlier. Then we can generate a heatmap of the correlations between interest in different benefits.And lastly, we‚Äôll generate the correlation matrix and plot the correlations.Again, since the data is randomly generated, we would expect there to be little to no correlation, and that is indeed what we find. (It is funny to note that SQL tutorials are slightly negatively correlated with drag-and-drop features, which is actually what we might expect to see in real data!)Let‚Äôs do one last type of plot, one that‚Äôs closely related to the heatmap: the clustermap. Clustermaps make correlations especially informative in analyzing survey responses, because they use hierarchical clustering to (in this case) group benefits together by how closely related they are. So instead of eyeballing the heatmap for which individual benefits are positively or negatively associated, which can get a little crazy when you have 10+ benefits, the plot will be segmented into clusters, which is a little easier to look at.You can also easily change the linkage type used in the calculation, if you‚Äôre familiar with the mathematical details of hierarchical clustering. Some of the available options are ‚Äòsingle‚Äô, ‚Äòaverage‚Äô, and ‚Äòward‚Äô ‚Äî I won‚Äôt get into the details, but ‚Äòward‚Äô is generally a safe bet when starting out.Long labels often require a little tweaking, so I‚Äôd recommend renaming your benefits to shorter names prior to using a clustermap.A quick assessment of this shows that the clustering algorithm believes drag-and-drop features and ready-made formulas cluster together, while custom dashboard templates and SQL tutorials form another cluster.

Handling Discriminatory Biases in Data for Machine Learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-and-discrimination-2ed1a8b01038,Matthew Stewart,6300,13,2817,"‚ÄúOf course algorithms are racist. They‚Äôre made by people.‚Äù ‚Äî Stephen Bush, New Statesman AmericaEthics in Machine LearningMost of the time, machine learning does not touch on particularly sensitive social, moral, or ethical issues. Someone gives us a data set and asks us to predict house prices based on given attributes, classifying pictures into different categories, or teaching a computer the best way to play PAC-MAN ‚Äî what do we do when we are asked to base predictions of protected attributes according to anti-discrimination laws?How do we ensure that we do not embed racist, sexist, or other potential biases into our algorithms, be it explicitly or implicitly?It may not surprise you that there have been several important lawsuits in the United States on this topic, possibly the most notably one involving Northpointe‚Äôs controversial COMPAS ‚Äî Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions ‚Äî software, which predicts the risk that a defendant will commit another crime. The proprietary algorithm considers some of the answers from a 137-item questionnaire to predict this risk.In February 2013, Eric Loomis was found driving a car that had been used in a shooting. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to eluding an officer. In determining his sentence, a judge looked not just to his criminal record, but also to a score assigned by a tool called COMPAS.COMPAS is one of several risk-assessment algorithms now used around the United States to predict hot spots of violent crime, determine the types of supervision that inmates might need, or ‚Äî as in Loomis‚Äôs case ‚Äî provide information that might be useful in sentencing. COMPAS classified him as high-risk of re-offending, and Loomis was sentenced to six years.He appealed the ruling on the grounds that the judge, in considering the outcome of an algorithm whose inner workings were secretive and could not be examined, violated due process. The appeal went up to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, who ruled against Loomis, noting that the sentence would have been the same had COMPAS never been consulted. Their ruling, however, urged caution and skepticism in the algorithm‚Äôs use.The case, understandably, caused quite a stir in the machine learning community ‚Äî I doubt anyone would want to be judged by an algorithm, after all, you cannot blame an algorithm for being unethical, can you?The Controversy GrowsSo far, all we have discussed is a purportedly unjust man who was allegedly judged harshly by an algorithm. However, the controversy behind this software gets a little more heated when we fast forward to 2014.After several more controversial results were spat out of the algorithm and scrutinized, it once again drew the public‚Äôs eye. Then U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned that the risk scores might be injecting bias into the courts. He called for the U.S. Sentencing Commission to study their use. ‚ÄúAlthough these measures were crafted with the best of intentions, I am concerned that they inadvertently undermine our efforts to ensure individualized and equal justice,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚Äúthey may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities that are already far too common in our criminal justice system and in our society.‚ÄùThe sentencing commission did not, however, launch a study of risk scores. So ProPublica did, as part of a larger examination of the powerful, largely hidden effect of algorithms in American life.ProPublica‚Äôs examination came up with some interesting conclusions. Not only was the algorithm absurdly inaccurate (less than 20% of its predictions were true), but it also showed significant racial disparities, just as Holder feared. In forecasting who would re-offend, the algorithm made mistakes with black and white defendants at roughly the same rate but in very different ways.Black defendants were still 77 percent more likely to be pegged as at higher risk of committing a future violent crime and 45 percent more likely to be predicted to commit a future crime of any kind.This may sound bad, but there is more to this story than meets the eye. Depending on the way we analyze this, we can find that the algorithm is both racist and not racist, it depends on the way we define ‚Äòequality‚Äô within our model. For the remainder of this article, I will try to help us understand that this the model was actually designed in an acceptable way, but can still produce purportedly racist results.Types of DiscriminationWe first need to define the types of discrimination that are possible in algorithms, and what kind we are dealing with in our previous examples. There are two forms of discrimination that we will refer to as disparate impact and disparate treatment.Disparate Treatment ‚Äî Involves classifying someone in an impermissible way. It involves the intent to discriminate, evidenced by explicit reference to group membership.Disparate Impact ‚Äî Looks at the consequences of classification/decision making on certain groups. No intent is required and it is facially neutral.Disparate impact is often referred to as unintentional discrimination, whereas disparate treatment is intentional.Practices with a disproportionate impact on a particular group are deemed by the Supreme Court to not cause disparate impact if they are ‚Äúgrounded in sound business considerations.‚ÄùIt is possible to cause disparate treatment or disparate impact when considering any of the following protected attributes.All of these attributes can be used as features in our machine learning algorithms, and thus our algorithms have the potential to discriminate on the basis of these attributes. Some common examples of this are facial recognition, recidivism (as previously discussed), and hiring. What can we do to help combat this?Combating disparate treatment is easy. Explicit discriminatory bias makes classification less accurate, so there is no good reason to do it. However, what about when discrimination is embedded in the historical data? Or the attributes are a result of past social injustices that still persist somewhat to this day?Discriminatory Bias in Training DataDiscrimination impacts social goods when classification and decision making is based on inaccurate information (for example, thinking that everyone over 7ft is a bad babysitter). These ideas are often perpetuated by human biases, and become embedded in data that is used to train algorithms.In this case, the biases of humans are not mitigated by the machine learning algorithm. In fact, they are reproduced in the classifications that are made. Why does this happen? Recidivism scores such as those made by the Northpointe software are based on prior arrests, age of first police contact, parents‚Äô incarceration record. This information is shaped by biases in the world (such as from cultural values and nationalism) and injustices more generally (such as racial prejudices).This bias is also present in natural language processing, which focuses on textual data. A good example of this is the research paper titled ‚ÄúMan is to Computer Programmer as Women is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings‚Äù, which showed automatically generated analogies from the software‚Äôs vectors, such as man ‚Üí computer-programmer, and women ‚Üí homemaker. These reflect sexism in the original texts.More generally, these sources of bias generally arise from:So how do we remove these biases? Machine learning algorithms can perpetuate discrimination because they are trained on biased data. The solution is to identify or generate an unbiased dataset from which to draw accurate generalizations.Removing BiasesCharacteristics such as race, gender, and socio-economic class determine other features about us that are relevant to the outcome of some performance tasks. These are protected attributes, but they‚Äôre still relevant to certain performance tasks ‚Äî and performance tasks that are putative social goods at that. For example:Machine learning is, by nature, historical. To effectively combat discrimination, we need to change these patterns. Machine learning, however, reinforces these patterns. Machine learning may therefore be part of the problem.‚ÄúEven if history is an arc that bends towards justice, machine learning doesn‚Äôt bend.‚ÄùSo where do we go from here? Are we doomed to have racist and sexist algorithms?Even when we optimize for accuracy, machine learning algorithms may perpetuate discrimination even when we work from an unbiased data set and have a performance task that has social goods in mind. What else could we do?Of all of these, optimizing for fairness seems like the easiest and the best course of action. In the next section, we will outline how to optimize a model for fairness.Optimizing for FairnessBuilding machine learning algorithms that optimize for non-discrimination can be done in 4 ways:We will discuss each of these in turn.Formalizing a non-discrimination criterion is essentially what the other 3 approaches involve, they are types of criterion which aim to formalize a non-discrimination criterion. However, this list is not exhaustive and there may be better approaches that have not been proposed yet.Demographic parity proposes that the decision (the target variable) should be independent of protected attributes ‚Äî race, gender etc. are irrelevant to the decision.For a binary decision Y and protected attribute A:P(Y=1 ‚à£ A=0) = P(Y=1‚à£A=1)The probability of some decision being made (Y=1) should be the same, regardless of the protected attribute (whether (A=1) or (A=0)). However, demographic parity rules out using the perfect predictor C=Y, where C is the predictor and Y the target variable.To understand the objection, consider the following case. Say that we want to predict whether an individual will purchase organic shampoo. Whether members of certain groups purchase organic shampoo is not independent of their membership of that group. But, demographic parity would rule out using the perfect predictor. So perhaps this is not the best procedure, maybe the others will give us a better result?Equalized odds proposes that the predictor and the protected attribute should be independent, conditional on the outcome. For the predictor R, outcome Y, and protected attribute A, where all three are binary variables:P(R=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(R=1|A=1, Y=1).The attribute (whether (A=1) or (A=0)) should not change your estimation (P) of how likely it is that some relevant predictor (R=1) holds true of the candidate. Instead, the outcome (of some decision) (Y=1) should. An advantage of this procedure is that this is compatible with the ideal predictor, R=Y.Consider the following case involving a student getting accepted into Yale, given that they were the valedictorian in their high school. Equalized odds posits that knowing whether the student is gay does not change the probability of whether the student was valedictorian.Predictor R = Whether you were high school valedictorian (1) or not (0)Outcome Y = Getting into Yale (1) or not (0)Attribute A = Being gay (1), being straight (0)P(R=1| A=0, Y=1) = P(R=1| A=1, Y=1).Well-calibrated systems propose that the outcome and protected attribute are independent, conditional on the predictor. For the predictor R, outcome Y, and protected attribute A, where all three are binary variables:P(Y=1|A=0, R=1) = P(Y=1|A=1, R=1)The probability of some outcome occurring (Y=1) should be unaffected by some protected attribute (whether (A=0) or (A=1)), and instead should be conditional on the relevant predictor (R=1). This formulation has the advantage that it is group unaware ‚Äî it holds everyone to the same standard.Contrasting this with our previous example, knowing that the student is gay does not change the probability of whether the student got into Yale. The distinction between equalized odds and well-calibrated systems is subtle, but important.In fact, this difference is the basis of the disagreement about the COMPAS software we discussed in the beginning.So is COMPAS racist?Equalized odds and well-calibrated systems are mutually incompatible standards. Sometimes, given certain empirical circumstances, we cannot have a system be both well-calibrated and equalize the odds. Let‚Äôs look at this fact in the context of the debate between ProPublica and Northpointe about whether COMPAS is biased against black defendants.Y = whether the defendant will reoffendA = race of the defendantR = recidivism predictor used by COMPASNorthpointe‚Äôs defense: COMPAS is well-calibrated, i.e.,P(Y=1|A=0, R=1) = P(Y=1|A=1, R=1).The COMPAS system makes roughly similar recidivism predictions for defendants, regardless of their race.ProPublica‚Äôs rejoinder: COMPAS has a higher false positive rate for black defendants and a higher false negative rate for white defendants, i.e., does not satisfy equalized odds:P(R=1|A=0, Y=1) ‚â† P(R=1|A=1, Y=1)The race of the defendant makes a difference to whether the individual is placed in the low or the medium/high-risk category. Whether (A=0) or (A=1) makes a difference to the probability that COMPAS has identified some recidivism risk predictor will hold of the defendant (P(R=1)), and not just whether the defendant will/won‚Äôt reoffend (Y=1).Why did this happen?When certain empirical facts hold, our ability to have a well-calibrated and an odds-equalizing system breaks down. It seems that what‚Äôs generating the problem is something we discussed earlier: background facts created by injustice. For example, higher rates of being caught re-offending due to higher police scrutiny.It‚Äôs hard to figure out when certain fairness criteria should apply. If some criterion didn‚Äôt come at a cost to the others, then you would worry less about applying one when you‚Äôre uncertain. But, since this isn‚Äôt the case, we need to understand the impact of failing to meet at some criteria.So which of our discussed criteria are the best to choose? All of these approaches have promising features, but all have their drawbacks.So what now?We cannot section off fairness in one little corner without fighting to change injustices in the world and discrimination that happens outside of machine learning systems. This doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt do anything! We must set some standards for fairness in certain domains, while at the same time striving to change base rates.Despite several controversies and its unpopularity amongst some, the COMPAS software continues to be used to this day. No one who develops an algorithm wants to be accused or imprisoned for unknowingly developing a racist algorithm, but some criteria must be selected to base predictions of in situations like that which COMPAS tries to tackle.It may be an algorithm, and it may not be perfect, but it is a start, and one has to start somewhere.Can Machine Learning Help to Reduce Discrimination?Machine learning is an extremely powerful tool. This is increasingly clear as humanity begins to transition from humanist to dataist perspectives‚Äî where we begin to trust algorithms and data more than people or our own thoughts (some people have driven into lakes because their GPS told them too!). This makes it extremely important that we try to make algorithms as unbiased as possible so that they do not unknowingly perpetuate social injustices that are embedded in historical data. However, there is also a huge potential to use algorithms to make a more just and equal society. A good example of this is in the hiring process.Say you are applying for your dream job and are in the final stage of the interview process. The hiring manager has the power to determine whether you are hired or not. Would you like an unbiased algorithm to decide whether you are the best person for the job?Would you still prefer this if you knew that the hiring manager was racist? Or sexist?Perhaps the hiring manager is a very neutral person and is basing the job purely on merit, however, everyone has their own proclivities and underlying cognitive biases that may make them more likely to select the candidate they like the most, as opposed to the person best for the job.If unbiased algorithms can be developed, the hiring process could become faster and less expensive, and their data could lead recruiters to more highly skilled people who are better matches for their companies. Another potential result: a more diverse workplace. The software relies on data to surface candidates from a wide variety of places and match their skills to the job requirements, free of human biases.This may not be the perfect solution, in fact, there is rarely a perfect answer when it comes to justice. However, the arc of history appears to tend towards justice, so perhaps this will give justice another step forwards.Another good example of this is automatic loan underwriting. Compared with traditional manual underwriting, automated underwriting more accurately predicts whether someone will default on a loan, and its greater accuracy results in higher borrower approval rates, especially for underserved applicants. The upshot of this is that sometimes machine learning algorithms do a better job than we would at making the most accurate classifications, and sometimes this combats discrimination in domains like hiring and credit approval.Food for ThoughtTo end such a long and serious article, I leave you with a quote from Google about discrimination in machine learning to mull over.‚ÄúOptimizing for equal opportunity is just one of many tools that can be used to improve machine learning systems ‚Äî and mathematics alone is unlikely to lead to the best solutions. Attacking discrimination in machine learning will ultimately require a careful, multidisciplinary approach.‚Äù ‚Äî GoogleFor updates on new blog posts and extra content, sign up for my newsletter.mailchi.mp[1] O‚ÄôNeil, Cathy.

I have tried to write these notes in a basic way to make them easy to consume. I‚Äôve recently become an aunt and have bought a few children‚Äôs books related to technology and space, I really love how the authors and illustrators have managed to simplify complicated topics. So, I‚Äôve been inspired to treat these topics in a similar way by simplifying them to make them a lot more accessible.*If you would like to know a little background info behind the course notes and other notes related to tech and product design you can find out more here.*The Microsoft Introduction to AI course provides an overview of AI and explores machine learning principles that provide the foundation for AI.

The course is free without a certificate however, if you‚Äôd like a certificate as proof of completion there is a fee. There are labs associated with this course that I won‚Äôt include in the notes as I believe the best way to learn is to actually do the labs. However, these notes are useful if you‚Äôd like to know about the fundamental theory behind AI and would like to learn it in a way that might be a lot simpler than other resources. I‚Äôve tried to write it in layman terms and have included visuals to help illustrate the ideas.

Think of it as putting a more human face on technology. AI is technology that can learn from vast amounts of data that is available in the modern world. Learning from this data it can understand our human kind of language and can respond in a similar kind of way. It‚Äôs technology that can see and interpret the world the way that we humans do.Machine learning (ML) provides the foundation for artificial intelligence.So what is it?Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data without explicitly programming that in. Well as the name suggests it‚Äôs a technique in which we train a software model using data. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process. The model learns from the training cases (training situations or examples) and then we can use the trained model to make predictions for new data cases. The key to this is to understand that fundamentally computers are very good at one thing and that is performing calculations. To have a computer make intelligent predictions from the data, we just need a way to train it to perform the correct calculations.We start with a dataset that contains historical records which we often call ‚Äòcases‚Äô or ‚Äòobservations‚Äô. Each observation includes numeric features. Numeric features are basically characteristics of the item we‚Äôre working with and they have a numeric value attached to each characteristic.Let‚Äôs call the numeric feature X.In general, we also have some value that we‚Äôre trying to predict which we‚Äôll call that Y. We use our training cases to train a machine learning model so that it can calculate a value for Y from the features in X. So in very simplistic terms, we‚Äôre creating a function that operates on a set of features ‚ÄòX‚Äô, to produce predictions ‚ÄòY‚Äô. Don‚Äôt worry if this is confusing it will make more sense in the next sections where we start to apply real world examples.Now generally speaking, there are two broad types of machine learning and they are called supervised and unsupervised.In supervised learning scenarios, we start with the observations that include known values for the variable that we want to predict. We call these ‚Äòlabels‚Äô. Since we started with data that includes the label we‚Äôre trying to predict, we can train the model using only some of the data and withhold the rest of the data which we can use to evaluate the performance of the model. We then use a machine learning algorithm to train a model that fits the features to the known label.Since we started with the known label value we can validate the model by comparing the value predicted by the function to the actual label value that we knew. Then when we‚Äôre happy that the model works well, we can use it with new observations for which the label is unknown and generate new predicted values.Unsupervised learning is different from supervised learning, in that this time we don‚Äôt have the known label values in the training dataset. We train the model by finding similarities between the observations. After the model is trained, each new observation is assigned to the cluster of observations with the most similar characteristics.Okay, let‚Äôs start with a supervised learning technique called ‚ÄòRegression‚Äô. Imagine we have some historic data about some health trials participants. We have information such as the exercise they have done, the number of calories they have spent and a lot more stats and info about them. In this case we could use machine learning to predict how many calories any new participants might be expected to burn while engaging in some exercises. When we need to predict a numeric value, like for example an amount of money or a temperature or the number of calories then what we use is a supervised learning technique called regression.For example, let‚Äôs suppose Rosy here is a participant in our health study. Here she is doing some weight exercises. We gather some data about Rosy when she first signed up for the study. We also gather data while she‚Äôs exercising and capture data using a fitness monitor smart watch.Now what we want do is model the calories burned using the features we have for Rosy‚Äôs exercise. These numeric features (X) are her age, weight, heart rate, duration, and so on. In this case we know all of the features and we know the label value (Y) of 231 calories. So we need an algorithm to learn the function that operates all of Rosy‚Äôs exercise features to give us a result of 231.Now of course a sample of only one person isn‚Äôt likely to give us a function that generalises well. So what we need to do is gather the same sort of data from lots of diverse participants and train our model based on this larger set of data.After we‚Äôve trained the model and we have a generalised function that can be used to calculate our label Y, we can then plot the values of Y calculated for specific features of X values on a chart like this.We can then interpolate any new values of X to predict an unknown Y.Now because we started with data that includes the label we are trying to predict, we can train the model using only some of the data and withhold the rest of the data for evaluating model performance.Then we can use the model to predict (F(X)) for evaluation data and compare the predictions or scored labels to the actual labels that we know to be true. The difference between the predicted and actual levels are what we call the ‚Äòresiduals‚Äô. Residuals can tell us something about the level of error in the model.Now there are a few ways we can measure the error in the model and these include root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute (MAE). Now both of these are absolute measures of error in the model.For example an RMSE value of 5 would mean that the standard deviation of error from our test error is 5 calories. Of course absolute values can vary wildly depending on what you are predicting. An error of 5 calories would seem to indicate a reasonably good model. But if we were predicting how long an exercise session takes an error of 5 hours would indicate a very bad model.So you might want to evaluate the model using relative metrics to indicate a more general level of error as a relative value between 0 and 1. Relative absolute error (RAE) and relative squared error (RSE) produce a metric where the closer to 0 the error, the better the model.The coefficient of determination (CoD(R2)) which we sometimes call R squared is another relative metric but this time a value closer to 1 indicates a good fit for the model.So we‚Äôve seen how to train a regression model to predict a numeric value. Now it‚Äôs time to look at another kind of supervised learning called classification. Classification is a technique that we can use to predict which class or category that something belongs to. The simplest variant of this is binary classification (ones and zeros) where we predict whether an entity belongs to one of two classes. It‚Äôs often used to determine if something is true or false about the entity.For example, suppose we take a number of patients in our health clinic and we gather some personal details. We run some tests and we can identify which patients are diabetic and which are not. We can learn a function that can be applied to these patient features and give the result 1 for patients that are diabetic and 0 for patients that aren‚Äôt.More generally, a binary classifier is a function that can be applied to features X to produce a Y value of 1 or 0.Now the function won‚Äôt actually calculate an absolute value of 1 or 0, it will calculate a value between 1 and 0. We will use a threshold value (dotted line in diagram) to decide whether the result should be counted as a 1 or a 0.When you use the model to predict values, the resulting value is classed as a 1 or a 0 depending on which side of the threshold line it falls.Because classification is a supervised learning technique we withhold some of the test data to validate the model using known labels.Cases where the model predicts a 1 for a test observation that actually has a label value of 1 these are considered true positives (TP).Similarly cases where the model predicts 0 and the actual label is 0 these are true negatives (TN).Now the choice of threshold determines how predictions are assigned to classes. In some cases a predicted value might be very close to the threshold but is still misclassified. You can move the threshold to control how the predicted values are classified. In the case of the diabetes model it might be better to have more false positives (FP) but reduce the number of false negatives (FN) so that more people who are at risk of diabetes get identified.The number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negative (FN) produced by your model is crucial in evaluating its effectiveness.The grouping of these are often shown in what‚Äôs called a confusion matrix shown below. This provides the basis for calculating performance metrics for the classifier. The simplest metric is accuracy which is just the number of correctly classified cases divided by the total number of cases.In this case there are 5 true positives (TP) and 4 true negatives (TN). There are also 2 false positives (FP) and no false negatives (FN). That gives us 9 correct predictions out of a total of 11 which is an accuracy of 0.82 or 82%.Now that might seem like a really good result but perhaps surprisingly accuracy actually isn‚Äôt all that useful as a measure of a model‚Äôs performance. Suppose that only 3% of the population is diabetic. I can create a model that simply always predicts zero and it would be 97% accurate but it‚Äôs completely useless for identifying potential diabetics.A more useful metric might be the fraction of cases classified as positive that are actually positive. This metric‚Äôs known as precision. In other words out of all the cases classified as positives which ones are true and not false alarms.In this case there are 5 true positives, and 2 false positives. So our precision is 5 / (7) which is 0.71 or 71% of our cases identified as positive are really diabetic and 29% are false alarms.In some situations we might want a metric that‚Äôs sensitive to the fraction of positive cases we correctly identify. We call this metric recall. Recall is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the combined true positives and false negatives. In other words, what fraction of positive cases are correctly identified?In this case, there are 5true positives and no false negatives. So our recall is 5 out of 5 which is of course is 1 or 100%. So in this case we‚Äôre correctly identifying all patients with diabetes. Now recall actually has another name sometimes it‚Äôs known as the True Positive Rate.There‚Äôs an equivalent rate for false positives compared to the actual number of negatives. In this case we have 2 false positives and 4 true negatives. So our false positive rate is 2/(6) which is 0.33.Now you may remember that the metrics we got were based on a threshold (blue dotted line) of around 0.3 and we can plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate for that threshold like this.If we were to move the threshold back to 0.5 our true positive rate becomes 4 out of 5 or 0.8. Our false positive rate is 1 out of 6 or 0.16 which we can plot here.Moving the threshold further to say 0.7 gives us a true positive rate of 2 out of 5 or a 0.4 and a false positive rate of 0 out of 6 or 0.If we plotted this for every possible threshold rate we would end up with a curved line as shown in the diagram below. Now this is known as a receiver operator characteristic, a ROC chart. Now the area under the curve (AUC) is an indication of how well the model predicts. Generally, you want to see a large AUC with a curve staying as close as possible to the top left corner of the chart. A perfect classifier would go straight up the left and then along the top giving an AUC of one. Now, you can always compare with a diagonal line and that represents how well the model would perform if you simply made a 50‚Äì50 guess. It‚Äôs an AUC of 0.5. So you‚Äôre just simply random guessing 50% of the time true, 50% false. In this case, our model has an AUC of 0.9 which means that our model is definitely outperforming guessing.Well, we‚Äôve seen some examples of supervised learning specifically regression and classification but what about unsupervised learning? Now with unsupervised learning techniques you don‚Äôt have a known label with which to train the model. But you can still use an algorithm that finds similarities in data observations in order to group them into clusters.Suppose for example our health clinic has a website that contains links to articles and medical and healthy lifestyle publications. Now I might want to automatically group similar articles together.Or maybe I want to segment our study participants and we can categorise them based on similar characteristics.There are a number of ways we can create a clustering model and we‚Äôre going to look at one of the most popular clustering techniques which is called k-means clustering.Now the key to understanding k-means is to remember that our data consists of rows of data and each row has multiple features. Now if we assume that each feature is a numeric value then we can plot them as coordinates. Now here we‚Äôre plotting two features on a two dimensional grid. But in reality, multiple features would be plotted in n-dimensional space.We then decide how many clusters we want to create which we call k. We plot k points at random locations that represent the center points of our clusters.In this case, k is 3 so we‚Äôre creating 3 clusters. Next, we identify which of the three centroids each point is closest to and assign the points to clusters accordingly.Then we move each centroid to the true center of the points and its cluster.We then reallocate the points in the cluster based on their nearest centroid.We just repeat that process until we have nicely separated clusters.So what do I mean by nicely separated? Well, we want a set of clusters that separate data by the greatest extent possible. To measure this we can compare the average distance between the cluster centers.In addition, the average distance between the points in the cluster and their centers.Clusters that maximise this ratio have the greatest separation. We can also use the ratio of the average distance between clusters and the maximum distance between the points and the centroid of the cluster.Now another way we could evaluate the results of a clustering algorithm is to use a method called principal component analysis (PCA). In this method we decompose the points in a cluster into directions. We represent the first two components of the PCA decomposition as an ellipse.The first principal component is along the direction of the maximum variance or major axis of the ellipse and the second PCA is along the minor axis of the ellipse. A cluster that is perfectly separate from the first cluster shows up as an ellipse with the major axis of the ellipse perpendicular to the ellipse of the first cluster.Every second cluster is reasonably well separated but not perfectly separated.Then it will have a major axis that is not quite perpendicular to the first ellipse. If the second cluster is quite poorly separated from the first then the major axis of both ellipses will be nearly collinear.So the ellipse may be more like a circle because the second cluster is less well defined.Thanks for reading this article, Part 1 of the Microsoft Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

Step-by-Step Guide to Creating R and Python Libraries (in JupyterLab),Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-guide-to-creating-r-and-python-libraries-e81bbea87911,Sean McClure,2100,32,6144,"R and Python are the bread and butter of today‚Äôs machine learning languages. R provides powerful statistics and quick visualizations, while Python offers an intuitive syntax, abundant support, and is the choice interface to today‚Äôs major AI frameworks.In this article we‚Äôll look at the steps involved in creating libraries in R and Python. This is a skill every machine learning practitioner should have in their toolbox. Libraries help us organize our code and share it with others, offering packaged functionality to the data community.NOTE: In this article I use the terms ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù and ‚Äúpackage‚Äù interchangeably. While some people differentiate these words I don‚Äôt find this distinction useful, and rarely see it done in practice. We can think of a library (or package) as a directory of scripts containing functions. Those functions are grouped together to help engineers and scientists solve challenges.Building today‚Äôs software doesn‚Äôt happen without extensive use of libraries. Libraries dramatically cut down the time and effort required for a team to bring work to production. By leveraging the open source community engineers and scientists can move their unique contribution towards a larger audience, and effectively improve the quality of their code. Companies of all sizes use these libraries to sit their work on top of existing functionality, making product development more productive and focused.But creating libraries isn‚Äôt just for production software. Libraries are critical to rapidly prototyping ideas, helping teams validate hypotheses and craft experimental software quickly. While popular libraries enjoy massive community support and a set of best practices, smaller projects can be converted into libraries overnight.By learning to create lighter-weight libraries we develop an ongoing habit of maintaining code and sharing our work. Our own development is sped up dramatically, and we anchor our coding efforts around a tangible unit of work we can improve over time.In this article we will focus on creating libraries in R and Python as well as hosting them on, and installing from, GitHub. This means we won‚Äôt look at popular hosting sites like CRAN for R and PyPI for Python. These are extra steps that are beyond the scope of this article.Focusing only on GitHub helps encourage practitioners to develop and share libraries more frequently. CRAN and PyPI have a number of criteria that must be met (and they change frequently), which can slow down the process of releasing our work. Rest assured, it is just as easy for others to install our libraries from GitHub. Also, the steps for CRAN and PyPI can always be added later should you feel your library would benefit from a hosting site.We will build both R and Python libraries using the same environment (JupyterLab), with the same high-level steps for both languages. This should help you build a working knowledge of the core steps required to package your code as a library.Let‚Äôs get started.We will be creating a library called datapeek in both R and Python. The datapeek library is a simple package offering a few useful functions for handling raw data. These functions are:encode_and_bindremove_featuresapply_function_to_columnget_closest_stringWe will look at these functions later. For now we need to setup an R and Python environment to create datapeek, along with a few libraries to support packaging our code. We will be using JupyterLab inside a Docker container, along with a ‚Äúdocker stack‚Äù that comes with the pieces we need.The Docker Stack we will use is called the jupyter/datascience-notebook. This image contains both R and Python environments, along with many of the packages typically used in machine learning.Since these run inside Docker you must have Docker installed on your machine. So install Docker if you don‚Äôt already have it, and once installed, run the following in terminal to pull the datascience-notebook:This will pull the most recent image hosted on Docker Hub.NOTE: Anytime you pull a project from Docker Hub you get the latest build. If some time passes since your last pull, pull again to update your image.Immediately after running the above command you should see the following:Once everything has been pulled we can confirm our new image exists by running the following:‚Ä¶ showing something similar to the following:Now that we have our Docker stack let‚Äôs setup JupyterLab.We will create our libraries inside a JupyterLab environment. JupyterLab is a web-based user interface for programming. With JupyterLab we have a lightweight IDE in the browser, making it convenient for building quick applications. JupyterLab provides everything we need to create libraries in R and Python, including:The datascience-notebook we just pulled contains an installation of JupyterLab so we don‚Äôt need to install this separately. Before running our Docker image we need to mount a volume to ensure our work is saved outside the container.First, create a folder called datapeek on your desktop (or anywhere you wish) and change into that directory. We need to run our Docker container with JupyterLab, so our full command should look as follows:You can learn more about Docker commands here. Importantly, the above command exposes our environment on port 8888, meaning we can access our container through the browser.After running the above command you should see the following output at the end:This tells us to copy and paste the provided URL into our browser. Open your browser and add the link in the address bar and hit enter (your token will be different):This will automatically open JupyterLab in your browser as a new tab:We are now ready to start building libraries.We begin this article with R, then look at Python.R is one of the ‚Äúbig 2‚Äù languages of machine learning. At the time of this writing it has well-over 10,000 libraries. Going to Available CRAN Packages By Date of Publication and running‚Ä¶‚Ä¶in the browser console gives me 13858. Minus the header and final row this gives 13856 packages. Needless to say R is not in need of variety. With strong community support and a concise (if not intuitive) language, R sits comfortably at the top of statistical languages worth learning.The most well-known treatise on creating R packages is Hadley Wickam‚Äôs book R Packages. Its contents are available for free online. For a deeper dive on topic I recommend looking there.We will use Hadley‚Äôs devtools package to abstract away the tedious tasks involved in creating packages. devtools is already installed in our Docker Stacks environment. We also require the roxygen2 package, which helps us document our functions. Since this doesn‚Äôt come pre-installed with our image let‚Äôs install that now.NOTE: From now on we‚Äôll use the terminal in JupyterLab in order to conveniently keep our work within the browser.Open terminal inside JupyterLab‚Äôs Launcher:NOTE: If you‚Äôd like to change your JupyterLab to dark theme, click on Settings at the top, JupyterLab Theme, then JupyterLab Dark:Inside the console type R, then‚Ä¶.With the necessary packages installed we‚Äôre ready to tackle each step.We need to create a directory for our package. We can do this in one line of code, using the devtools create function. In terminal run:This automatically creates the bare bone files and directories needed to define our R package. In JupyterLab you will see a set of new folders and files created on the left side.NOTE: You will also see your new directory structure created on your desktop (or wherever you chose to create it) since we mounted a volume to our container during setup.If we inspect our package in JupyterLab we now see:The R folder will eventually contain our R code. The my_package.Rproj file is specific to the RStudio IDE so we can ignore that. The DESCRIPTION folder holds our package‚Äôs metadata (a detailed discussion can be found here). Finally, NAMSPACE is a file that ensures our library plays nicely with others, and is more of a CRAN requirement.We must follow these rules when naming an R package:You can read more about naming packages here. Our package name ‚Äúdatapeek‚Äù passes the above criteria. Let‚Äôs head over to CRAN and do a Command+F search for ‚Äúdatapeek‚Äù to ensure it‚Äôs not already taken:‚Ä¶looks like we‚Äôre good.The job of the DESCRIPTION file is to store important metadata about our package. These data include others packages required to run our library, our license, and our contact information. Technically, the definition of a package in R is any directory containing a DESCRIPTION file, so always ensure this is present.Click on the DESCRIPTION file in JupyterLab‚Äôs directory listing. You will see the basic details created automatically when we ran devtools::create(‚Äúdatapeek‚Äù) :Let‚Äôs add our specific details so our package contains the necessary metadata. Simply edit this file inside JupyterLab. Here are the details I am adding:Of course you should fill out these parts with your own details. You can read more about the definitions of each of these in Hadley‚Äôs chapter on metadata. As a brief overview‚Ä¶the package, title, and version parts are self-explanatory, just be sure to keep title to one line. Authors@R must adhere to the format you see above, since it contains executable R code. Note the role argument, which allows us to list the main contributors of our library. The usual ones are:aut: authorcre: creator or maintainerctb: contributorscph: copyright holderThere are many more options, with the full list found here.You can add multiple authors by listing them as a vector:NOTE: If you do plan on hosting your library on CRAN be sure your email address is correct, as CRAN will use this to contact you.The description can be multiple lines, limited to 1 paragraph. We use depends to specify the minimum version of R our package depends on. You should use an R version equal or greater than the one you used to build your library. Most people today set their License to MIT, which permits anyone to ‚Äúuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software‚Äù as long as your copyright is included. You can learn more about the MIT license here. Encoding ensures our library can be opened, read and saved using modern parsers, and LazyData refers to how data in our package are loaded. Since we set ours to true it means our data won‚Äôt occupy memory until they are used.Our library wouldn‚Äôt do much without functions. Let‚Äôs add the 4 functions mentioned in the beginning of this article. The following GIST shows our datapeek functions in R:We have to add our functions to the R folder, since this is where R looks for any functions inside a library.Since our library only contains 4 functions we will place all of them into a single file called utilities.R, with this file residing inside the R folder.Go into the directory in JupyterLab and open the R folder. Click on Text File in the Launcher and paste in our 4 R functions. Right-click the file and rename it to utilities.R.It isn‚Äôt enough to simply place R functions in our file. Each function must be exported to expose them to users of our library. This is accomplished by adding the @export tag above each function.The export syntax comes from Roxygen, and ensures our function gets added to the NAMESPACE. Let‚Äôs add the @export tag to our first function:Do this for the remaining functions as well.NOTE: In larger libraries we would only export functions that need to be usable outside our package. This helps reduce the chances of a conflict with another library.It is important to document our functions. Documenting functions provides information for users, such that when they type ?datapeek they get details about our package. Documenting also supports working with vignettes, which are a long-form type of documentation. You can read more about documenting functions here.There are 2 sub-steps we will take:‚Äî Add the Document AnnotationsDocumentation is added above our function, directly above our #‚Äô @export line. Here‚Äôs the example with our first function:We space out the lines for readability, adding a title, description, and any parameters used by the function. Let‚Äôs do this for our remaining functions:‚Äî Run devtools::document()With documentation added to our functions we then run the following in terminal, just outside the root directory:NOTE: Make sure you‚Äôre one level outside the datapeek directory.You may get the error:In this case open terminal in JupyterLab and install roxygen2. You should also install data.table and mltools, since our first function uses these:Run the devtools::document() again. You should see the following:This will generate .Rd files inside a new man folder. You‚Äôll notice an .Rd file is created for each function in our package.If you look at your DESCRIPTION file it will now show a new line at the bottom:This will also generate a NAMESPACE file:We can see our 4 functions have been exposed. Let‚Äôs now move onto ensuring dependencies are specified inside our library.It is common for our functions to require functions found in other libraries. There are 2 things we must do to ensure external functionality is made available to our library‚Äôs functions:You‚Äôll notice in the above GIST we simply listed our libraries at the top. While this works well in stand-alone R scripts it isn‚Äôt the way to use dependencies in an R package. When creating R packages we must use the ‚Äúdouble-colon approach‚Äù to ensure the correct function is read. This is related to how ‚Äútop-level code‚Äù (code that isn‚Äôt an object like a function) in an R package is only executed when the package is built, not when it‚Äôs loaded.For example:‚Ä¶won‚Äôt work because auc_roc will not be available (running library(datapeek) doesn‚Äôt re-execute library(mltools)). This will work:The only function in our datapeek package requiring additional packages is our first one:Notice each time we call an external function we preface it with the external library and double colons.We must also list external dependencies in our DESCRIPTION file, so they are handled correctly. Let‚Äôs add our imports to the DESCRIPTION file:Be sure to have the imported libraries comma-separated. Notice we didn‚Äôt specify any versions for our external dependencies. If we need to specify versions we can use parentheses after the package name:Since our encode_and_bind function isn‚Äôt taking advantage of any bleeding-edge updates we will leave it without any version specified.Sometimes it makes sense to include data inside our library. Package data can allow our user‚Äôs to practice with our library‚Äôs functions, and also helps with testing, since machine learning packages will always contain functions that ingest and transform data. The 4 options for adding external data to an R package are:You can learn more about these different approaches here. For this article we will stick with the most common approach, which is to add external data to an R folder.Let‚Äôs add the Iris dataset to our library in order to provide users a quick way to test our functions. The data must be in the .rda format, created using R‚Äôs save() function, and have the same name as the file. We can ensure these criteria are satisfied by using devtools‚Äô use_data function:Above, I read in the Iris dataset from its URL and pass the data frame to devtools::use_data().In JupyterLab we see a new data folder has been created, along with our iris.rda dataset:We will use our added dataset to run tests in the following section.Testing is an important part of software development. Testing helps ensure our code works as expected, and makes debugging our code a much faster and more effective process. Learn more about testing R packages here.A common challenge in testing is knowing what we should test. Testing every function in a large library is cumbersome and not always needed, while not enough testing can make it harder to find and correct bugs when they arise.I like the following quote from Martin Fowler regarding when to test:‚ÄúWhenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead.‚Äù ‚Äî Martin FowlerIf you prototype applications regularly you‚Äôll find yourself writing to the console frequently to see if a piece of code returns what you expect. In data science, writing interactive code is even more common, since machine learning work is highly experimental. On one hand this provides ample opportunity to think about which tests to write. On the other hand, the non-deterministic nature of machine learning code means testing certain aspect of ML can be less than straightforward. As a general rule, look for obvious deterministic pieces of your code that should return the same output every time.The interactive testing we do in data science is manual, but what we are looking for in our packages is automated testing. Automated testing means we run a suite of pre-defined tests to ensure our package works end-to-end.While there are many kinds of tests in software, here we are taking about ‚Äúunit tests.‚Äù Thinking in terms of unit tests forces us to break up our code into more modular components, which is good practice in software design.NOTE: If you are used to testing in languages like Python, notice that R is more functional in nature (i.e., methods belong to functions not classes), so there will be some differences.There are 2 sub-steps we will take for testing our R library:6A: Creating the tests/testthat folder;6B: Writing tests.‚Äî 6A: Creating the tests/testthat folderJust as R expects our R scripts and data to be in specific folders it also expects the same for our tests. To create the tests folder, we run the following in JupyterLab‚Äôs R console:You may get the following error:If so, use the same approach above for installing roxygen2 in Jupyter‚Äôs terminal.Running devtools::use_testthat() will produce the following output:There will now be a new tests folder in our main directory:The above command also created a file called testthat.R inside the tests folder. This runs all your tests when R CMD check runs (we‚Äôll look at that shortly). You‚Äôll also notice testthat has been added under Suggests in our DESCRIPTION file:‚Äî 6B: Writing Teststestthat is the most popular unit testing package for R, used by at least 2,600 CRAN package, not to mention libraries on Github. You can check out the latest news regarding testthat on the Tidyverse page here. Also check out its documentation.There are 3 levels to testing we need to consider:Assertions are the functions included in the testing library we choose. We use assertions to check whether our own functions return the expected output. Assertions come in many flavors, depending on what is being checked. In the following section I will cover the main tests used in R programming, showing each one failing so you can understand how it works.Equality AssertionsThere are subtle differences between the examples above. For example, expect_equal is used to check for equality within a numerical tolerance, while expect_identical tests for exact equivalence. Here are examples:As you write more tests you‚Äôll understand when to use each one. Of course always refer to the documentation referenced above when in doubt.Testing for String MatchesTesting for LengthTesting for ComparisonTesting for LogicTesting for OutputsThere are many more included in the testthat library. If you are new to testing, start writing a few simple ones to get used to the process. With time you‚Äôll build an intuition around what to test and when.A test is a group of assertions. We write tests in testthat as follows:We can see we have both a description (the test name) and the code (containing the assertions). The description completes the sentence, ‚Äútest that ‚Ä¶.‚ÄùAbove, we are saying ‚Äútest that this functionality does what it should.‚ÄùThe assertions are the outputs we wish to test. For example:NOTE: It is worth considering the balance between cohesion and coupling with our test files. As stated in Hadley‚Äôs book, ‚Äúthe two extremes are clearly bad (all tests in one file, one file per test). You need to find a happy medium that works for you. A good starting place is to have one file of tests for each complicated function.‚ÄùThe last thing we do in testing is create files. As stated above, a‚Äúfile‚Äù in testing is a group of tests covering a related set of functionality. Our test file must live inside thetests/testthat/ directory. Here is an example test file for the stringr package on GitHub:The file is called test-case.R (starts with ‚Äútest‚Äù) and lives inside the tests/testthat/ directory. The context at the top simply allows us to provide a simple description of the file‚Äôs contents. This appears in the console when we run our tests.Let‚Äôs create our test file, which will contain tests and assertions related to our 4 functions. As usual, we use JupyterLab‚Äôs Text File in Launcher to create and rename a new file:Now let‚Äôs add our tests:For the first function I am going to make sure a data frame with the correct number of features is returned:Notice how we called our encode_and_bind function, then simply checked the equality between the dimensions and the expected output. We run our automated tests at any point to ensure our test file runs and we get the expected output. Running devtools::test() in the console runs our tests:We get a smiley face too!Since our second function removes a specified feature I will use the same test as above, checking for the dimensions of the returned frame. Our third function applies a specified function to a chosen column, so I will write a test that checks the result of given specified function. Finally, our fourth function returns the closest matching string, so I will simply check the returned string for the expected result.Here is our full test file:NOTE: Notice the relative path to the data in the test file.As we did above, we run our tests using the following command:This will run all tests in any test files we placed inside the testthat directory. Let‚Äôs check the result:We had 5 assertions across 4 unit tests, placed in one test file. Looks like we‚Äôre good. If any of our tests failed we would see this in the above printout, at which point we would look to correct the issue.This has traditionally been done using ‚ÄúVignettes‚Äù in R. You can learn about creating R vignettes for your R package here. Personally, I find this a dated approach to documentation. I prefer to use things like Sphinx or Julep. Documentation should be easily shared, searchable and hosted.Click on the question mark at julepcode.com to learn how to use Julep.I created and hosted some simple documentation for our R datapeek library, which you can find here.Of course we will also have the library on GitHub, which I cover below.As I mentioned in the introduction we should be creating libraries on a regular basis, so others can benefit from and extend our work. The best way to do this is through GitHub, which is the standard way to distribute and collaborate on open source software projects.In case you‚Äôre new to GitHub here‚Äôs a quick tutorial to get you started so we can push our datapeek project to a remote repo.Sign up/in to GitHub and create a new repository.‚Ä¶which will provide us with the usual screen:With our remote repo setup we can initialize our local repo on our machine, and send our first commit.Open Terminal in JupyterLab and change into the datapeek directory:Initialize the local repo:Add the remote origin (your link will be different):Now run git add . to add all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging area:Don‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúdot‚Äù in the above command. Now we can commit our changes, which adds any new code to our local repo.But, since we are working inside a Docker container the username and email associated with our local repo cannot be autodetected. We can set these by running the following in terminal:Use the email address and username you use to sign into GitHub.Now we can commit:With our new code committed we can do our push, which transfers the last commit(s) to our remote repo:NOTE: Since we are in Docker you‚Äôll likely get asked again for authentication. Simply add your GitHub username and password when prompted. Then run the above command again.Some readers will notice we didn‚Äôt place a .gitignore file in our directory. It is usually fine to push all files inside smaller R libraries. For larger libraries, or libraries containing large datasets, you can use the site gitignore.io to see what common gitignore files look like. Here is a common R .gitignore file for R:To recap, git add adds all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory to the staging area. Commit adds any changes to our local repo, and push transfers the last commit(s) to our remote repo. While git add might seem superfluous, the reason it exists is because sometimes we want to only commit certain files, this we can stage files selectively. Above, we staged all files by using the ‚Äúdot‚Äù after git add.You may also notice we didn‚Äôt include a README file. You should indeed include this, however for the sake of brevity I have left this step out.Now, anyone can use our library. üëç Let‚Äôs see how.As mentioned in the introduction I will not be discussing CRAN in this article. Sticking with GitHub make it easier to share our code frequently, and we can always add CRAN criteria later.To install a library from GitHub, users can simply run the following command on their local machine:As such, we can simply instruct others wishing to use datapeek to run the following command on their local machine:This is something we would include in a README file and/or any other documentation we create. This will install our package like any other package we get from CRAN:Users then load the library as usual and they‚Äôre good to go:I recommend trying the above commands in a new R environment to confirm the installation and loading of your new library works as expected.Creating Python libraries follows the same high-level steps we saw previously for R. We require a basic directory structure with proper naming conventions, functions with descriptions, imports, specified dependencies, added datasets, documentation, and the ability to share and allow others to install our library.We will use JupyterLab to build our Python library, just as we did for R.In the beginning of this article I discussed the difference between a ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù and a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù, and how I prefer to use these terms interchangeably. The same holds for Python libraries. ‚ÄúModules‚Äù are another term, and in Python simply refer to any file containing Python code. Python libraries obviously contain modules as scripts.I stated in the introduction that we will host and install our libraries on and from GitHub. This encourages rapid creation and sharing of libraries without getting bogged down by publishing criteria on popular package hosting sites for R and Python.The most popular hosting site for Python is the Python Package Index (PyPI). This is a place for finding, installing and publishing python libraries. Whenever you run pip install <package_name> (or easy_intall) you are fetching a package from PyPI.While we won‚Äôt cover hosting our package on PyPI it‚Äôs still a good idea to see if our library name is unique. This will minimize confusion with other popular Python libraries and improve the odds our library name is distinctive, should we decide to someday host it on PyPI.First, we should follow a few naming conventions for Python libraries.Our library name is datapeek, so the first and third criteria are met; let‚Äôs check PyPI for uniqueness:All good. üëçWe‚Äôre now ready to move through each step required to create a Python library.JupyterLab should be up-and-running as per the instructions in the setup section of this article.Use JupyterLab‚Äôs New Folder and Text File options to create the following directory structure and files:NOTE: Bold names are folders and light names are files. We will refer to the inner datapeek folder as the ‚Äúmodule directory‚Äù and the outer datapeek directory as the ‚Äúroot directory.‚ÄùThe following video shows me creating our datapeek directory in JupyterLab:There will be files we do not want to commit to source control. These are files that are created by the Python build system. As such, let‚Äôs also add the following .gitignore file to our package framework:NOTE: At the time of this writing JupyterLab lacks a front-end setting to toggle hidden files in the browser. As such, we will simply name our file gitignore (no preceding dot); we will change it to a hidden file later prior to pushing to GitHub.Add your gitignore file as a simple text file to the root directory:Just as we did for R, we should add metadata about our new library. We do this using Setuptools. Setuptools is a Python library designed to facilitate packaging Python projects.Open setup.py and add the following details for our library:Of course you should change the authoring to your own. We will add more details to this file later. The keywords are fairly self-explanatory. url is the URL of our project on GitHub, which we will add later; unless you‚Äôve already created your python repo, in which case add the URL now. We talked about licensing in the R section. zip_safe simply means our package can be run safely as a zip file which will usually be the case. You can learn more about what can be added to the setup.py file here.Our library obviously requires functions to be useful. For larger libraries we would organize our modules so as to balance cohesion/coupling, but since our library is small we will simply keep all functions inside a single file.We will add the same functions we did for R, this time written in Python:Add these functions to the utilities.py module, inside datapeek‚Äôs module directory.Our library will often require other packages as dependencies. Our user‚Äôs Python environment will need to be aware of these when installing our library (so these other packages can also be installed). Setuptools provides the install_requires keyword to list any packages our library depends on.Our datapeek library depends on the fuzzywuzzy package for fuzzy string matching, and the pandas package for high-performance manipulation of data structures. To specify our dependencies, add the following to your setup.py file:Your setup.py file should currently look as follows:We can confirm all is in order by running the following in a JupyterLab terminal session:NOTE: Run this in datapeek‚Äôs root directory.After running the command you should see something like this:‚Ä¶with an ending that reads:Finished processing dependencies for datapeek==0.1If one or more of our dependencies is not available on PyPI, but is available on GitHub (e.g. a bleeding-edge machine learning package is only available on Github‚Ä¶or it‚Äôs another one of our team‚Äôs libraries hosted only on GitHub), we can use dependency_links inside our setup call:If you want to add additional metadata, such as status, licensing, language version, etc. we can use classifiers like this:To learn more about the different classifiers that can be added to our setup.py file see here.Just as we did above in R we can add data to our Python library. In Python these are called Non-Code Files and can include things like images, data, documentation, etc.We add data to our library‚Äôs module directory, so that any code that requires those data can use a relative path from the consuming module‚Äôs __file__ variable.Let‚Äôs add the Iris dataset to our library in order to provide users a quick way to test our functions. First, use the New Folder button in JupyterLab to create a new folder called data inside the module directory:‚Ä¶then make a new Text File inside the data folder called iris.csv, and paste the data from here into the new file.If you close and open the new csv file it will render inside JupyterLab as a proper table:We specify Non-Code Files using a MANIFEST.in file. Create another Text File called MANIFEST.in placing it inside your root folder:‚Ä¶and add this line to the file:NOTE: The MANIFEST.in is often not needed, but included in this tutorial for completeness. See here for more discussion.We also need to include the following line in setup.py:Our setup.py file should now look like this:As with our R library we should add tests so others can extend our library and ensure their own functions do not conflict with existing code. Add a test folder to our library‚Äôs module directory:Our test folder should have its own __init__.py file as well as the test file itself. Create those now using JupyterLab‚Äôs Text File option:Our datapeek directory structure is now set to house test functions, which we will write now.Writing tests in Python is similar to doing so in R. Assertions are used to check the expected outputs produced by our library‚Äôs functions. We can use these ‚Äúunit tests‚Äù to check a variety of expected outputs depending on what might be expected to fail. For example, we might want to ensure a data frame is returned, or perhaps the correct number of columns after some known transformation.I will add a simple test for each of our 4 functions. Feel free to add your own tests. Think about what should be checked, and keep in mind Martin Fowler‚Äôs quote shown in the R section of this article.We will use unittest, a popular unit testing framework in Python.Add unit tests to the datapeek_tests.py file, ensuring the unittest and datapeek libraries are imported:To run these tests we can use Nose, which extends unittest to make testing easier. Install nose using a terminal session in JupyterLab:We also need to add the following lines to setup.py:Our setup.py should now look like this:Run the following from the root directory to run our tests:Setuptools will take care of installing nose if required and running the test suite. After running the above, you should see the following:All our tests have passed!If any test should fail, the unittest framework will show which functions did not pass. At this point, check to ensure you are calling the function correctly and that the output is indeed what you expected. It can also be good practice to purposely write tests to fail first, then write your functions until they pass.As I mentioned in the R section, I use Julep to rapidly create sharable and searchable documentation. This avoids writing cryptic annotations and provides the ability to immediately host our documentation. Of course this doesn‚Äôt come with the IDE hooks that other documentation does, but for rapidly communicating it works.You can find the documentation I create for this library here.The standard approach for sharing python libraries is through PyPI. Just as we didn‚Äôt cover CRAN with R, we will not cover hosting our library on PyPI. While the requirements are fewer than those associated with CRAN there are still a number of steps that must be taken to successfully host on PyPI. The steps required to host on sites other than GitHub can always be added later.We covered the steps for adding a project to GitHub in the R section. The same steps apply here.I mentioned above the need to rename our gitignore file to make it a hidden file. You can do that by running the following in terminal:You‚Äôll notice this file is no longer visible in our JupyterLab directory (it eventually disappears). Since JupyterLab still lacks a front-end setting to toggle hidden files simply run the following in terminal at anytime to see hidden files:We can make it visible again should we need to view/edit the file in JupyterLab, by running:Here is a quick recap on pushing our library to GitHub (change git URL to your own):Now, anyone can use our python library. üëç Let‚Äôs see how.While we usually install Python libraries using the following command:‚Ä¶ this requires hosting our library on PyPI, which as explained above is beyond the scope of this article. Instead we will learn how to install our Python libraries from GitHub, as we did for R. This approach still requires the pip install command but uses the GitHub URL instead of the package name.With our library hosted on GitHub, we simply use pip install git+ followed by the URL provided on our GitHub repo (available by clicking the Clone or Download button on the GitHub website):Now, we can import our library into our Python environment. For a single function:‚Ä¶and for all functions:Let‚Äôs do a quick check in a new Python environment to ensure our functions are available. Spinning up a new Docker container, I run the following:Fetch a dataset:Check functions:Success!In this article we looked at how to create both R and Python libraries using JupyterLab running inside a Docker container. Docker allowed us to leverage Docker Stacks such that our environment was easily controlled and common packages available. This also made it easy to use the same high-level interface to create libraries through the browser for 2 different languages. All files were written to our local machine since we mounted a volume inside Docker.Creating libraries is a critical skill for any machine learning practitioner, and something I encourage others to do regularly. Libraries help isolate our work inside useful abstractions, improves reproducibility, makes our work shareable, and is the first step towards designing better software. Using a lightweight approach ensures we can prototype and share quickly, with the option to add more detailed practices and publishing criteria later as needed.As always, please ask questions in the comments section should you run into issues. Happy coding.If you enjoyed this article you might also enjoy:towardsdatascience.comtowardsdatascience.comtowardsdatascience.com",31/03/2019,4,70,332,69,931,304,44,17,0,75,605
Getting Started with Google BigQuery‚Äôs Machine Learning ‚Äî Titanic Dataset,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-bigquerys-machine-learning-titanic-dataset-ab7294efb863,Alex Blyakhman,78,12,2403,"While still in Beta, BigQuery ML has been available since mid last year; however, I didn‚Äôt get around to working with this Google cloud-based Machine Learning offering until recently. As a non-data scientist, my first impression ‚Äî what‚Äôs not to like? After all, the ability to run ML models from the comfort of web-based SQL editor is a dream come-true for any analyst out there. Not only this platform eliminates the need to learn a programming language, be it R , Python or SAS; it also streamlines data engineering process by leveraging existing BigQuery data sources, instead of having to bring external data into your model. Effectively, this product removes a number of barriers to entry into this coveted data science specialty and democratizes the field of ML by allowing any analyst with adequate knowledge of SQL to run linear and logistic regression models without having to invest in pricey hardware, such as multi-core GPUs usually needed to support a scalable ML project. Below image does a great job showcasing platform‚Äôs capabilities:Many aspiring data science students turn to the trusted Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster data set from one of the most popular Kaggle competitions to practice working with binary classification models. In fact, for a beginner, a binary classification model is a fairly easy concept to grasp: your task is to simply predict whether a certain event will occur or will not happen; or whether a certain condition will evaluate to be true or false. For this problem, anyone is able to wrap their head around the concept of predicting whether a particular Titanic ship passenger survives one of the most monumental ship wrecks of all times: there are only two possibilities here. To follow along you simply need to log in to existing Kaggle account or create a new one and download all three files provides. The irony of using Kaggle website (purchased by Google back in 2017) and BigQuery platform (another Google product) is not lost on me. Let‚Äôs dive into this problem using sample data set and a working BigQuery instance.We can apply different Analytics frameworks to determine which steps are needed to complete the task at hand. The approach that worked for me typically includes below, let‚Äôs adopt it for our Machine Learning process:It goes without saying that understanding what it is we are trying to accomplish here is a given. Similar to any business problems you might be faced with, we have to understand precisely what the goal of this exercise is: selecting relevant factors to help us accurately predict if a given passenger survives the Titanic wreck.Step 1 ‚Äî Exploring Titanic data setA. Defining dataFirst things first, let‚Äôs look into the data Kaggle makes available for us. We can think of three CSV files: training and test data sets, along with the gender_submission as three database tables available for our analysis. We will use the training set to build our machine learning model, while we will run the model on the test set to predict the outcome (survival of the wreck.) The submission table could serve as a template we would follow to test the accuracy of our predictions by submitting results to Kaggle for scoring. According to the data dictionary, we have quite a few fiedls in our training table we could consider in our solution to predict survival:PasserngerID ‚Äî unique ID assigned to each passenger;Survived ‚Äî Survival flag, where value of 1 indicates that passenger survived and 0 identifies perished passengers ‚Äî this represents a target value we are trying to predict;Pclass ‚Äî Passenger‚Äôs ticket class, which can also be interpreted as a proxy for socio-economic status: 1 stands for first class ticket/Upper class citizen, 2 for the second class ticket/Middle class, and 3 for the third class ticket holders/lower class citizens;Name ‚Äî Passenger‚Äôs name;Sex ‚Äî Passenger‚Äôs gender, make a mental note that for the purposes of model building we would need to convert this string type of record into a numeric data type;Age ‚Äî Passenger‚Äôs age (in years);SibSp ‚Äî Number of siblings/spouses traveling together;Parch ‚Äî Number of parents/children traveling together;Ticket ‚Äî Passenger‚Äôs ticket number;Fare‚Äî Passenger fare, how much this passenger paid for their ticket;Cabin‚ÄîCabin number assigned to the passenger;Embarked ‚ÄîPort of Embarkation ( C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)B. Identifying what‚Äôs missingWe can start by looking at missing values within our data set. A quick spot check would typically suffice when working with a small data set such as ours. In fact, just browsing through records we can identify the only three fields with missing values: Age, Cabin, and Embarked. To quantify the impact of missing values let‚Äôs run our very first SQL query on this data:It appears that one in five records is missing Age value, while three out of four Cabin records cannot be found, with only 2 of 891 records missing Embarked flag:Note that I‚Äôm using Standard SQL in the query and imported our training data into tbl_train table saved within dataset_Titanic data set within prj-titanic project in my BigQuery instance.Practically speaking, not all variables (or features should we choose to use them in the model) available should be used in any given prediction model; in case of the Titanic data set we can recall from the second highest-grossing movie of all times that women and children first policy worked in favor of women and children who were given priority in terms of having access to lifeboats. First class passengers seemed to be the next favored group. Let‚Äôs explore our data to see if in fact Sex, Age, and Pclass could be good predictors of passenger survival.C. Which data is relevant?A quick query below validates above assumption for the Sex dimension. Based on the data provided, women were almost 4(!) times more likely to survive this wreck then men:Note that the above chart comes courtesy of seamless BigQuery and DataStudio integration; a truly end-to-end exploratory data analysis solution from Google.When querying survival rate for Pclass variable we can also confirm that passenger class should in fact be one of the features/predictors of our model:When it comes to visualizing your data, it‚Äôs much easier to work with categorical data, rather than values of continuous data type. Before we graph results for the Age variable, let‚Äôs bucket passengers in different age bracket. You might think of a better solution, but I personally would use five age groups:Child - Under the age of 13Teenager - Between 13 and 18 years oldYoung Adult - Between 19 and 35 years of ageAdult - 36 to 55 age groupSenior Citizen - Over 55.When we run our new query it becomes apparent that children did survive at considerably higher rates than other age groups. Teenagers took the distant second spot:Naturally, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that fields such as Name, PassengerID, Ticket, and similar could possibly have any bearing on survival, however other less intuitive fields might in fact be helpful. What happens if we look at the survival rate by Embarked category? Ignoring two missing records which show 100% survival rate, Cherbourg stands out from the other two ports in terms of having higher survival rate, with Queenstown being more favorable than Southampton:Step 2 ‚ÄîData cleansingA. Handling missing valuesAfter completing the EDA process, it‚Äôs time to get our hands dirty with some basic data wrangling tasks. Assuming we are keen on using all four fields discussed above: Age, Sex, PClass and Embarked, we need to account for 177 missing Age values and 2 Embarked values.Let‚Äôs try to impute port of embarkation based on everything that we do know about passengers. The easiest solution would be to look at distribution of passengers by their embarkation point, which leads to Southampton representing 72% of all passengers:Additionally we can consider using PClass information to see if the majority of first-class ticket holders embarked from a particular port. With the help of the below query we can determine that 59% of such passengers did embark from Southampton as well:Another way to accomplish this task would be to see if the Cabin information can be used to fill in these missing values. After some rudimentary search we can learn that the first letter of the cabin field refers to the deck, which naturally is highly correlated to the passenger class value. In our case, B happens to stand for the Promenade (not to be confused with the Upper Promenade) deck. Looking at the distribution of passengers by known port of embarkation for this deck, it‚Äôs a fair coin toss, with roughly half of folks (51.11% to be exact) starting their journey in Southampton and remaining half coming from Cherbourg.Summarizing all of the above findings let‚Äôs take a leap of (somewhat calculated) faith and assume that the missing Embarked values should be assigned the value of S [Southampton.] Dealing with the 177 missing Age values is not as trivial, partly due to the size of this sample, partly due to the absence of reliable predictors in the data set. We can perhaps look at passengers‚Äô names to decipher their titles and make reliable assumptions that all of the married passengers (Mrs., etc) are definitely not children. It would become more difficult to zoom in on their actual age, other than perhaps look at mean or mode values in the data. Let‚Äôs simplify our life and take the easy way out here: let‚Äôs ignore all of the records with missing Age values in hopes of having large enough remaining data set to utilize in our prediction model.B. Preparing data for the modelSpeaking of the models, they don‚Äôt play very nicely with the text/string data types, we would need to convert all such fields into numeric values. For example for the Sex field we can perhaps assign a value of 1 to all males and value of 0 to all females.Moving on to the Pclass field, we can recall from previous observations that first-class passengers were 1.33 more likely to survive than the second-class ticket holders. However, if we just use nominal values of 1 and 2 for respective ticket classes, this relationship would be incorrectly interpreted as second-class passengers being twice as likely to perish than the first-class ticket holders. We could scale this relationship by creating three fields (one for each passenger class) and flagging records accordingly. First-class ticket holder would have a value of True (read: 1) in the PClass1_Flg field, and values of False (read: 0) for the PClass2_Flg and PClass3_Flg columns:We would apply a similar principle to the Age category fields and create five new fields to flag records according to the passenger age group.Step 3‚Äî Run our machine learning Titanic modelA. Create our modelWe are finally done with all of the prep work and ready to proceed to the final phase of our project. To demonstrate how easy it is to create our model let‚Äôs follow BigQuery ML syntax below and run our first logistic regression model based on a single feature ‚Äî Gender:B. Evaluate model resultsIt only takes one line of code to evaluate our model, and the results look rather promisingC. Run our modelThe moment of truth is here, let‚Äôs run our model against the test data, let‚Äôs create a table with model results while we‚Äôre at it:Working with a single feature/column wasn‚Äôt that hard, but as we recall from our EDA, gender seems to be the best predictor of survival. It‚Äôs time to save this table as CSV and make our Kaggle submission. This fairly effortless exercise yielded 76.55% accuracy placed us in the top 74% of all Kaggle contestants. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of analytics power to see that this score is actually shared with other 1,481 competition participants, so effectively ,we are in the top 60%! There is definitely room to grow from here, but not too shabby for the first try.D. Experiment and optimizeTest and iterate is the definitely the spirit here. We can further experiment with the model by fitting it to our needs, be it changing the learning rate, setting regularization, capping the number of iterations, etc. All of these parameters can be found in the OPTIONS portion of the model statement.In addition, we can try to improve the accuracy of our model by changing the features used; let‚Äôs use this approach. I was very saddened to realize that by adding additional features (age category, passenger class, and port of embarkation) the accuracy of the model actually went down:We should be able to do better though, correct? What if we consider the fact that families might have a better chance of survival by staying together and helping each other. Luckily, we can add number of parents/children travelling together (parch) and number of siblings/spouses (sibsp) to tally up total family size. It helps to know that as per our earlier EDA there are no missing values within these two fields. Please also note that passengers traveling solo would have 0 values in either of the fields. Let‚Äôs build a new, more comprehensive and hopefully more accurate model then:This tactic was right on the money, we marginally improved the accuracy of our submission to 77%, and moved 1,476 places up, bypassing all of the folks using gender as the only predictor. We now share our position with only 583 competitors, effectively placing us into the top 54%!I‚Äôm not certain what the realistic accuracy level we can aim to achieve, (all of those 95%+ scores on the leaderboard do seem suspicious), however one thing to keep in mind is that the type of model might play a role here, perhaps Random Forest can yield better results than classification? Nonetheless, there is still work to do when it comes to improving our score.If you‚Äôre looking for the next steps, Google does provide BigQuery ML Getting Started guides for both: data analyst and data scientist tracks. Good luck on your machine learning journey! Please share your thoughts and methodology used, should you be more successful in your results!3/31/19 Edit ‚Äî Thanks to a very informative comment by Felipe Hoffa, I learned that some of my code used above was actually redundant; in fact BigQuery makes things even simpler.Replace this code:With this statement:Should you want to learn more BigQuery and BigQuery ML tips and tricks turn to Felipe‚Äôs excellent post here and all of the other articles he shared so far.P.S.

An Executive‚Äôs Guide to Implementing AI and Machine Learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/an-executives-guide-to-implementing-ai-and-machine-learning-2f1dc2d18b60,Tim Darling,445,7,1371,"As a Chief Analytics Officer, I‚Äôve had to bridge the gap between business needs and data scientists. How that gap is bridged is, in my experience, the difference between how well the value and promise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is realized. Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned.AI = machine learning (at least in 2019)Machine learning is a path to get to AI. At least as of 2019, it is the only known viable path that I‚Äôm aware of. In the coming years, there may be other approaches. The two terms are not interchangeable, but for our purposes I will focus on machine learning.Machine learning is a category of tools and approaches where a computer is given a large training set of data that includes an ‚Äúanswer key‚Äù. The machine then learns how to derive the answer key from combinations of the inputs. The model is then tested against a different testing data set to determine its accuracy.Machine learning as a category can include basic statistical tools (e.g. linear regression) that fit this approach. It also includes neural networks, decision trees, and several other tools.Is machine learning the right tool for the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve?This one has tripped me up in the past.For example, recently I had a data set with a lot of data collected from hospitals which had, for each employee, fifty measurements (for example, whether they showed up for work on time or whether they were consistently the only experienced person on their shift) and an indicator of whether they resigned in the weeks and months following. The question was: given this data set, could we create a model to predict employees who would resign before they did so, allowing hospitals to intervene early?We spent months reviewing the data set and had used basic data visualization approaches to determine a set of rules. For example, employees who were just hired were twice as likely to resign than employees who had already worked at the hospital for ten years. Employees in certain clinical specialties had different average resignation rates as did employees in specific age ranges. Employees who were asked to work over sixty hours a week for two or more weeks per month were 50% more likely to resign.Was this problem a good candidate for machine learning? Couldn‚Äôt we just assemble these rules and build a statistical model?Ultimately, I believe it was a good candidate, but a similar problem might not have been. Caltech Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa describes three qualities that problems need to have to be candidates for machine learning:1 - There is enough data.2 - There is a relationship between the inputs you have and what you‚Äôre trying to predict.3 - The pattern cannot be described in plain English.Starting here and making sure that the right tools are deployed might save you a lot of time. Even if the above are true for your data set, are they true enough to justify the investment in the approach?From an ROI perspective, is the value of predicting an event that happens = to the cost of erroneously predicting one that does not?Data analysts compare and optimize models based on accuracy. Accuracy is a tradeoff between predicting as many of the events that will happen versus incorrectly predicting as few of the events that will not. There are ways to adjust the model thresholds to see the tradeoff after the models are run, but interpreting such results requires a bit of mental gymnastics.A better approach for business owners is to set up the models before running them in the terms of the business objective. In our example, the value of correctly predicting an employee who will resign might be worth thousands of dollars (i.e. the value of avoiding having to replace them with a new hire) whereas the cost of incorrectly predicting the resignation of an employee may be small. However, there are thresholds: if 10% of the workforce resigns every year, our understanding of our customers informs us that we can‚Äôt identify more than, say 20%, as high risks to intervene on. These criteria need to be translated from business requirements and vernacular (e.g. ROI) into model inputs (e.g. penalty matrices).The important point is to determine the relative cost versus value of this tradeoff and to ensure the model is built to optimize on it.One of the most famous machine learning implementations, the Netflix Prize, overlooked this I believe. The prize was given to the model that could most accurately predict movies that a viewer would like. Accuracy in their case was impartial to whether we gave a low score to a movie they might love or whether we gave a high score to a movie they might dislike. Is that the right business need though? If Netflix recommends five movies to me and I know I will strongly dislike two of them, as a user, I may well discount any of their recommendations in the future. But if I see five movies recommended for me and it doesn‚Äôt happen to include a movie I know I‚Äôll love‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs really not an issue for me at all.Do you need stability in the model? In other words, if one small thing changes in the input, is it OK that the output swings wildly?In my experience, the more accurate the model (at least by machine learning‚Äôs definition of accuracy), the more discontinuous the input-output relationship.If you have a series of photos and you want a machine learning model to flag the ones that include a fire hydrant, you may well be OK with this level of instability because there‚Äôs no case where a user will change a pixel in a photo and expect that the output will remain similar.In our case, though, some amount of stability is important. If we‚Äôre following an employee over time, we don‚Äôt want their predicted resignation risk to jump unpredictably every month when their age goes from 31.1 to 31.2 to 31.3.Do you need to know which input fields are contributing to the predicted output? Or is it OK to have a complete black box?Neural networks are black box models. You give it your inputs and it will return an output; that‚Äôs it. You get no insights into how it got the output or which inputs were most heavily weighted in the determination of the output. Neural networks tend to be more accurate than other models, but is the extra few percentage points of accuracy worth the complete lack of transparency to you from a business need?Other models, such as linear regression and decision trees, will show you the combination of inputs that lead to the outputs. Data analysts may want to run multiple decision trees and take the average of all of their outputs. This may increase model accuracy but may reduce the ability to see how it is working.I‚Äôve found mixing models to be a way to get the best of both approaches. One model is a neural network model (with some dampening factor to maintain stability) that gives the turnover risk value. Another model is a linear regression that identifies the key drivers. We display the results of both to users. There‚Äôs some risk in that there‚Äôs no guarantee the models will match up (in other words, the neural network may identify a high-risk event that the other model does not identify drivers for) but there are ways to account for this.In conclusion ‚Ä¶The above question and discussion sections were based on experiences I‚Äôve had trying to bridge the gap between business objectives and analytics teams. Business objectives require a mix of both art than science. The science behind machine learning is increasingly commoditized: models are available for anyone to run and there is a wealth of resources available for getting to mathematically robust results. But the business you‚Äôre building is not a mathematical one. It‚Äôs a mix of user needs, marketing needs, and practicalities of integrating and deploying solutions. The art of deploying machine learning solutions is particularly interesting to me and hopefully these give some points for consideration.Also published on strategist.blog, where I share thoughts on building analytics-based products and businesses.

Trust and interpretability in machine learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/trust-and-interpretability-in-machine-learning-b7be41f01704,Abhishek Mukherjee,174,9,2137,"Do machine learning models always need to be interpretable? Given a choice between an interpretable model that is inaccurate and a non-interpretable model that is accurate, wouldn‚Äôt you rather choose the non-interpretable but accurate model? In other words, is there any reason for sacrificing accuracy at the altar of interpretability?Before going any further we should try to clarify what makes a model interpretable. Often, interpretability is equated with simplicity. This definition is obviously ambiguous; what is simple for one person may not be so for another. More importantly, advanced machine learning is most useful for modeling complex systems. These systems are called complex for a reason ‚Äî they are not simple! Demanding that useful models for such systems should be simple, by any measure, makes very little sense.Perhaps, we can go further if we consider how we think about interpretability in a traditional modeling setting. Consider the mathematical model of an internal combustion engine in a car. I doubt if anyone would consider that to be simple. But, on the other hand, I also doubt if anyone would consider the model of an internal combustion engine to be non-interpretable, either. This is primarily because we can derive this model in a deductive manner from well established physical theories such as thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.Why not use this as our definition of interpretability? A model should be considered to be interpretable if it can be derived (or at least motivated) from a trustworthy theory. This definition of interpretability serves the dual purpose of understanding and trust. It helps us understand the model because we tend to understand things in a deductive manner ‚Äî by going from the known to the unknown. Also, with such a definition, the trust in the model is derived from the trust that we place in the underlying theory.Indeed, there are situations where both understanding and trust are necessary ‚Äî scenarios where we are interested in determining the causal factors behind the behavior of a system. In such scenarios, we must insist that the corresponding models must be interpretable according to the above definition. Most models in the realm of physical sciences belong to this category. One can argue that purely inductive blackbox models are not suitable for such scenarios.However, there are many other situations where understanding might be nice to have, but by no means is it a must have. In these situations what really matters is the ability to make trustworthy predictions. In these situations, if we could provide an alternate source of trust, then our models need not be bound by the definition of interpretability given above. This is a common argument, and there is merit to it. Remember, machine learning is a way of systematically building models from (preferably) large amounts of data using inductive reasoning. Constraining these models to be interpretable in a deductive manner can seriously limit their accuracy.So then the question becomes how can we generate trust in a blackbox model where we have little to no insight into its inner workings. A credible basis for trust could be testing. After all, testing forms the basis of our trust in regular software. But to test a model we need be able to formalize our expectations about it. If we could formalize our expectations completely then that would correspond to a complete specification of the model itself. In that case, we would not really need machine learning or any other modeling methodology. What we really need to be able to do is to formalize our expectations about the aspects of the model that we consider important. This is not easy either, because many of the concepts that we care about, such as fairness, do not lend themselves to a convenient mathematical treatment.It is worth pointing out that significant progress has been made in developing testing methodologies for testing machine learning models. I personally find the idea of using metamorphic relations for formalizing expectations to be particularly promising. But, we are still a long way from having concrete methodologies that will allow us to perform comprehensive testing of blackbox models, and this inability of ours contributes to a trust deficit in blackbox models.One could question the efficacy of such expectation-based comprehensive testing. After all, the goal of machine learning is to find undiscovered patterns in data. By insisting that the models meet our expectations amounts to pre-defining the model, which defeats the whole purpose. Following this line of reasoning, one would argue that as long as the data is representative and our algorithms are powerful enough to capture the patterns, there is little reason not to trust the model ‚Äî we should expect the model results to generalize to the overall population, and the extent to which we should expect them to generalize is encapsulated in the model‚Äôs performance (accuracy) scores.Thus, in essence we are asked to delegate our trust to the trifecta of data, algorithms and performance scores. We first need to dissuade ourselves from the notion that a single performance (accuracy) score can form sufficient basis for trusting the model. A performance score is usually a point estimate of how a model is expected to generalize on an average over a population given the current data. Trust, on the other hand, is a nuanced multidimensional concept that cannot be encapsulated in such a single coarse grained score. One can imagine defining more granular performance scores‚Äî e.g. by population segments. But, that would require a certain level of understanding of the population and determining what we consider important ‚Äî this is not very different from forming expectations.Let us examine the data aspect of this argument. It is, indeed, quite easy to convince oneself that if the data is representative of the population we are interested in, then it should contain all the relevant patterns and no spurious ones. Unfortunately, that is rarely the case. The degree to which the data can be non-representative depends quite acutely on the situation. Nonetheless, we can identify certain high level scenarios.In the first scenario, we would have a good understanding of the population and complete control over the data collection mechanism. In this scenario, we can choose our data to be representative, and with a high degree of confidence we can expect our resulting model‚Äôs predictions to be applicable to the overall population. However, note that having a good enough understanding of the population to be able to draw a representative sample for the task at hand means that we already have some understanding of which features are important for the prediction. Hence, in this case it is debatable if blackbox models are terribly useful. Opinion polling for predicting election results is a good example of this scenario.In the second scenario, we do not have complete control over the data collection, but our predictions do not affect the data collected. In this scenario, if we assume that the data collection mechanism is unbiased then were we to wait long enough, we would have a representative sample of the population. Of course, there are a lot of ifs and buts that go with this assumption. Firstly, one does not know how long is long enough. Thus one needs to assume that the time scale over which the data is collected is long enough to produce a representative sample. Furthermore, the population itself might change in the meantime. Thus, an additional assumption is that the time scale over which population changes is much longer than the time scale over which a representative sample is generated. As long as we can justify those assumptions, then the estimated performance will be reliable. A model for predicting the stock prices is an example of such a scenario ‚Äî as long as we are not making investments that are large enough to tip the market as a whole, the decisions that we make as the result of the predictions should not affect the stock prices.The third scenario is one where the data collection is impacted by the predictions, but we have a moderate to high risk appetite for wrong predictions. An example of this is a product recommender system. The model for a recommender systems will be trained on data consisting of ordered lists of products that different users have bought/clicked on. Based on this data the model will predict what a user is most likely to buy/click on and based on the model‚Äôs predictions the system will decide what the user gets to see, which limits what (s)he can buy/click-on. Thus the prediction biases the data collection. In product recommender systems, one can circumvent this problem, somewhat, by keeping an exploration budget ‚Äî for a fraction of the cases the system shows the user a random set of products regardless of the prediction of the model. The observations resulting from these randomized predictions can then be used to estimate the performance of the model. One still has to address the concerns of the aforementioned second scenario in order to access the reliability of these estimates.In the fourth and final scenario, the data collection is impacted by the predictions, but we have little to no risk appetite for wrong predictions. For example, suppose we have to build a model to predict whether someone will default on their mortgage loan payments. The mortgage loan will be approved or not based on the prediction. If the prediction is that the person will default, then the loan will not be approved, and in that case there is no way of knowing whether this person would have actually defaulted or not. It is difficult to imagine a situation where an institution would randomly approve (or otherwise) a loan for the sake of data exploration. In these situations, it is very difficult to gauge the reliability of the estimated performance of the resulting model without additional information.Thus, it is not such a great idea to blindly expect the data to be representative of the population. In most scenarios, given the constraints of the problem at hand, it simply might not be possible to get an unbiased representative sample. Understanding the limitations of one‚Äôs data collection mechanism, being able to deduce the implications of those limitations, and having the honesty to report those as a part of the model‚Äôs results goes a long way in building trust.Let us now consider the algorithm aspect of the argument. It is a widespread belief that the more flexible an algorithm is the better it is, because flexibility equips an algorithm to capture more complex patterns. But if the history of the actual successful applications of machine learning are anything to go by, then this belief would appear to be utterly misplaced. In computer vision, success came when we were able to encode the symmetries in pictures into models in the form of convolutional neural networks. In natural language processing we are now able to build extremely accurate cross-purpose language models because we could encode our knowledge about languages, including structure and word context, into these models. In recommender systems ‚Äî most collaborative filtering algorithms including matrix factorization methods, make strong assumptions about the affinity of a user towards an item.Whether we would like to slap the label of interpretability on these models or not, it is an objective fact that we build better models when we understand the domain and the context in which the model needs to operate. The best models do not come from the most flexible algorithms, they come from algorithms that are well constrained by domain knowledge and have just the right amount of flexibility to capture the relevant patterns in the data.We have seen the word understanding being used quite a few times in the above discussion. What we should have realized by now is that it is difficult to build trust without understanding. In the end, it boils down to how one perceives machine learning. Yes, machine learning is an incredibly powerful inductive modeling technique. When combined with big data and big compute, it allows us to model systems and solve problems that were previously out of our reach. But the entry of machine learning should not imply the exit of everything else, including common sense. Machine learning is one element in the wider modeling family that includes deductive modeling as well as domain knowledge. The better we understand and leverage the interconnections between these elements, the further we will go towards robust complex system modeling.Trust is contextual and trust can have multiple sources, but eventually it flows from knowledge and integrity; specifically in our trust in the knowledge and integrity of the individuals who are building the models. Trust as well as adoption of models will come, in my opinion, only when the wider audience is convinced that the modelers have the knowledge to understand the limitations of their models (machine learning or otherwise), and the integrity to report them.",30/03/2019,0,0,0,0,1050,787,1,0,0,3,181
What libraries can load image in Python and what are their difference?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-library-can-load-image-in-python-and-what-are-their-difference-d1628c6623ad,Kevin Luk,307,3,196,"When we face computer vision project, first of all we need to load the images before any preprocessing.There are various libraries out there to perform imread() .

Transfer Learning Intuition for Text Classification,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-learning-series-part-4-transfer-learning-intuition-for-text-classification-4eb90495c19f,Rahul Agarwal,13600,10,1587,"This post is the fourth post of the NLP Text classification series. To give you a recap, I started up with an NLP text classification competition on Kaggle called Quora Question insincerity challenge. So I thought to share the knowledge via a series of blog posts on text classification. The first post talked about the different preprocessing techniques that work with Deep learning models and increasing embeddings coverage. In the second post, I talked through some basic conventional models like TFIDF, Count Vectorizer, Hashing, etc. that have been used in text classification and tried to access their performance to create a baseline. In the third post, I delved deeper into Deep learning models and the various architectures we could use to solve the text Classification problem. In this post, I will try to use ULMFit model which is a transfer learning approach for NLP.As a side note: if you want to know more about NLP, I would like to recommend this excellent course on Natural Language Processing in the Advanced machine learning specialization. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial. This course covers a wide range of tasks in Natural Language Processing from basic to advanced: sentiment analysis, summarization, dialogue state tracking, to name a few. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial.Before introducing the notion of transfer learning to NLP applications, we will first need to understand a little bit about Language models.In very basic terms, the objective of the language model is to predict the next word given a stream of input words. In the past, many different approaches have been used to solve this particular problem. Probabilistic models using Markov assumption is one example of this sort of models.In the recent era, people have been using RNNs/LSTMs to create such language models. They take as input a word embedding and at each time state return the probability distribution of next word probability over the dictionary words. An example of this is shown below in which the below Neural Network uses multiple stacked layers of RNN cells to learn a language model to predict the next word.Now, why do we need the concept of Language Modeling? Or How does predicting the next word tie with the current task of text classification? The intuition ties to the way that the neural network gets trained. The neural network that can predict the next word after being trained on a massive corpus like Wikipedia already has learned a lot of structure in a particular language. Can we use this knowledge in the weights of the network for our advantage? Yes, we can, and that is where the idea of Transfer Learning in NLP stems from. So to make this intuition more concrete, Let us think that our neural network is divided into two parts -Now as it goes in a lot of transfer learning models for Image, we stack the Language Specific part with some dense and softmax layers(Our new task) and train on our new task to achieve what we want to do.Now the concept of Transfer learning in NLP is not entirely new and people already used Language models for transfer learning back in 2015‚Äì16 without good result. So what has changed now?The thing that has changed is that people like Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder have done a lot of research on how to train these networks. And so we have achieved state of the art results on many text datasets with Transfer Learning approaches.Let‚Äôs follow up with the key research findings in the ULMFit paper written by them along with the code.To Train a model as per ULMFiT we need to take these three steps:a) Create a Base Language Model: Training the language model on a general-domain corpus that captures high-level natural language features b) Finetune Base Language Model on Task Specific Data: Fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on target task data c) Finetune Base Language Model Layers + Task Specific Layers on Task Specific Data: Fine-tuning the classifier on target task dataSo let us go through these three steps one by one along with the code that is provided to us with the FastAI library.This task might be the most time-consuming task. This model is analogous to resnet50 or Inception for the vision task. In the paper, they use the language model AWD-LSTM, a regular LSTM architecture trained with various tuned dropout hyperparameters. This model was trained on Wikitext-103 consisting of 28,595 preprocessed Wikipedia articles and 103 million words. We won‚Äôt perform this task ourselves and will use the fabulous FastAI library to use this model as below. The code below will take our data and preprocess it for usage in the AWD_LSTM model as well as load the model.It is also where we preprocess the data as per the required usage for the FastAI models. For example:The tokenized prepared data is based on a lot of research from the FastAI developers. To make this post a little bit complete, I am sharing some of the tokens definition as well.This task is also pretty easy when we look at the code. The specific details of how we do the training is what holds the essence.The paper introduced two general concepts for this learning stage:The Main Idea is: As different layers capture different types of information, they should be fine-tuned to different extents. Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, discriminative fine-tuning allows us to tune each layer with different learning rates. In the paper, the authors suggest first to finetune only the last layer, and then unfreeze all the layers with a learning rate lowered by a factor of 2.6.According to the authors: ‚ÄúFor adapting its parameters to task-specific features, we would like the model to quickly converge to a suitable region of the parameter space in the beginning of training and then refine its parameters‚ÄùThe Main Idea is to use a high learning rate at the starting stage for increased learning and low learning rates to finetune at later stages in an epoch.After training our Language model on the Quora dataset, we should be able to see how our model performs on the Language Model task itself. FastAI library provides us with a simple function to do that.This is the stage where task-specific learning takes place that is we add the classification layers and fine-tune them to perform our current task of text classification.The authors augment the pretrained language model with two additional linear blocks. Each block uses batch normalization and dropout, with ReLU activations for the intermediate layer and a softmax activation that outputs a probability distribution over target classes at the last layer. The params of these task-specific layers are the only ones that are learned from scratch.Here also the Authors have derived a few novel methods:The authors use not only the concatenation of all the hidden state but also the Maxpool and Meanpool representation of all hidden states as input to the linear layers.Rather than fine-tuning all layers at once, which risks catastrophic forgetting(Forgetting everything we have learned so far from language models), the authors propose to gradually unfreeze the model starting from the last layer as this contains the least general knowledge. The Authors first unfreeze the last layer and fine-tune all unfrozen layers for one epoch. They then unfreeze the next lower frozen layer and repeat, until they finetune all layers until convergence at the last iteration. The function slice(2e-3/100, 2e-3) means that we train every layer with different learning rates ranging from max to min value.One can get the predictions for the test data at once using:I am a big fan of Kaggle Kernels. One could not have imagined having all that compute for free. You can find a running version of the above code in this kaggle kernel. Do try to experiment with it after forking and running the code. Also please upvote the kernel if you find it helpful.Here are the final results of all the different approaches I have tried on the Kaggle Dataset. I ran a 5 fold Stratified CV.The results achieved were not very good compared to deep learning methods, but I still liked the idea of the transfer learning approach, and it was so easy to implement it using fastAI. Also running the code took a lot of time at 9 hours, compared to other methods which got over in 2 hours.Even if this approach didn‚Äôt work well for this dataset, it is a valid approach for other datasets, as the Authors of the paper have achieved pretty good results on different datasets ‚Äî definitely a genuine method to try out.PS: Note that I didn‚Äôt work on tuning the above models, so these results are only cursory. You can try to squeeze more performance by performing hyperparameter tuning using hyperopt or just old fashioned Grid-search.Finally, this post concludes my NLP Learning series. It took a lot of time to write, but the effort was well worth it. I hope you will find it helpful in your work. I will try to write some more on this topic when I get some time.

Repetition in Songs: A Python Tutorial,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/repetition-in-songs-a-python-tutorial-3dbd1c279f19,Okoh Anita,624,8,1398,"Everyone has heard a song or knows what a song sounds like. I can carelessly say everyone can define a song ‚Ä¶in their own words. Just for the benefit of the doubt, a song (according to Wikipedia) is a single work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections.In his journal article called ‚ÄúThe complexity of Songs‚Äù, computer scientist Donald Knuth capitalized on the tendency of popular songs to devolve from long and content-rich ballads to highly repetitive texts. As some may waste no time agreeing with his notion, it does raise some questions like: Does repetitiveness really help songs become a hit? Is music really becoming more repetitive over time?In an attempt to teach some basic python code in the form of a case study, I am going to test this hypothesis (Are popular songs really repetitive?)with one of my favorite songs. One way to test this hypothesis is to figure out the unique words and calculate the fraction of those words to the total number of words in a song.In this tutorial, we‚Äôll cover:To get the most out of this tutorial, you can follow along by running the codes yourself.For the purpose of this case study, we will streamline our hypothesis by asking two major questions:Let's get started analyzing already1.A String is a list of characters. A character is anything you can type on the keyboard in one keystroke, like a letter, a number, or a backslash. However, Python recognizes strings as anything that is delimited by quotation marks either a double quote (‚Äú ‚Äú) or a single quote (‚Äò ‚Äò) at the beginning and end of a character or text. For example: ‚ÄòHello world‚ÄôFor this case study, a string is our lyrics as seen below2.Variables are typically descriptive names, words or symbols used to assign or store values. In other words, they are storage placeholders for any datatype. It is quite handy in order to refer to a value at any time. A variable is always assigned with an equal sign, followed by the value of thevariable. (A way to view your code output is to use a print function. As you may already know with Jupyter notebook, an output can be viewed without a print function)To store the lyrics, we will assign it a variable named perfect_lyrics .3.Lists can be created simply by putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.). It can even have another list as an item. For example:Now that we have gotten a sense of what a list looks like. Let go back to our data.Since one of our aims is to figure out the number of unique words used, it means we will need to do a bit of counting i.e to count each word. In order to achieve these, we will not only have to put our string into a list but will have to separate each word using a .split()method. Therefore our dataset will look like thisInputOutputFrom the above output, you will notice that each word has been separated into independent strings. And the whole lyrics make up the list called split_lyrics(which is also a variable)We will also need to separate the unique words of the rest of the words and the count. To do this, we would need to use python functions.A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Python has many built-in functions like print( )-to show your output, list( )-to create a list, len( )- to count the number of characters in a list or string, etc. Python also allows you to create your own functions. But we will not be creating our own function in this case study.We will be using a few functions in the case study but we will start with the set( ) function. To separate the unique words from the whole lyrics, we need a set( ) and a print ( ) function i.eInputOutputTo count the number of words in the whole lyrics, we would need a len ( ) functionInput & OutputDoing the same for the unique words extractedOur above analysis has helped answer our first question: How many unique words were used as compared to the whole lyrics of the song?Simply put, 129 unique words were used in over 290 words in total.Our next goal is to figure out the second part of the question What are the most repetitive words used and how many times were they used?In order to answer this question, we will need to learn more data structures.4. Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of items. While data structures have only values as an element, A dictionary has a key:value pair. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value. An example is a simple German-English dictionary:5. Loopsare great when trying to run the same block of code over and over again. In python, there are two types of loops: for and while. For this analysis, we will focus more on the for loop. The for loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence. It is often used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat ‚Äòn‚Äô number of times.It works like this: ‚Äú for all elements in a list or dictionary, do this ‚ÄúFor exampleGoing back to our datasetTo know the most repeated word(s), we need to know the number of times each word appeared in the lyrics. To do that, we will need to use both a dictionary(to store each word with their corresponding count) and a for loop (to iterate the counting process as each word appears)First, we need to store the unique words in a dictionaryInput & OutputThen we need to use the for loop again to count the number of times each unique word appears in the whole lyrics.Input & OutputNow we have found out the number of times each word appears, let's sort them out to view them from highest to lowest using the sorted ( ) functionThere seem to be too many words that only occurred once. Because our aim is to find the most popular word or words, we will narrow our list to the 10 words by slicing it. You can learn more about slicing hereInput & OutputThen changing back to a dictionaryAn additional question will be: What are the 10 most popular words in the song called perfect by Ed Sheeran? We can easily extract this information by using the key ( )method under the dictionary data structure and then creating a list of those words.Input & OutputFrom the above output code, we can confidently say that the most popular word used in the song called Perfect by Ed Sheeran is ‚ÄòI‚Äô which appeared 24 timesLet‚Äôs improve our analysis a little further6. Visualizing data with python.Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this analysis, we will focus data visualization strictly on a library in Python, namely Matplotlib.Lets quickly visualize the analysis on the top 10 most popular words in our case studyWhat are some key insights we can draw from this case study? I can spot out threeThis case study does help to see that a greater percentage of a song is made up of repetitive words. However, we can not conclude with just one song that Donald Knuth theory is true. We will need to analyze a lot more songs to conclude that hit songs are as a result of the repetitiveness of words in a song. Although it is good to point out that Perfect by Ed Sheeran was actually a Hit song‚Ä¶ (and still is in my world).If you want to improve your Python skills, these are some articles that may helpP.S Like me, anyone can learn to be a data analyst and if you want to be notified on my next project or updates on my learning, feel free to sign up to my newsletter",30/03/2019,2,3,26,24,847,213,12,5,0,8,144
Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-convolutional-neural-network-3f7ef6c9b7ae,KamWoh Ng,167,5,699,"This paper by Quanshi Zhang, Ying Nian Wu, and Song-Chun Zhu from University of California, Los Angeles proposes a method to modify traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) into interpretable CNNs, in order to clarify knowledge representations in high conv-layers of CNNs.Problem: without any additional human supervision, can we modify a CNN to obtain interpretable knowledge representations in its conv-layers?Bau et al. [1] defined six kinds of semantics in CNNs, i.e. objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors.In fact, we can roughly consider the first two semantics as object-part patterns with specific shapes, and summarize the last four semantics as texture patterns without clear contours. Filters in low conv-layers usually describe simple textures, whereas filters in high conv-layers are more likely to represent object parts.Their approach is to train each filter in a high conv-layer to represent an object part. In a traditional CNN, a high-layer filter may describe a mixture of patterns, i.e. the filter may be activated by both the head part and the leg part of a cat (Figure 1). Such complex representations in high conv-layers significantly decrease the network interpretability. Therefore, their approach forces the filter in an interpretable CNN is activated by a certain part.This paper invented a generic loss to regularize the representation of a filter to improve its interpretability.The loss encourages a low entropy of inter-category activations and a low entropy of spatial distributions of neural activations which means forcing feature map of a layer in a CNN not to be randomly activated by different region of an object and to have consistent distribution of activations.The filter must be activated by a single part of the object, rather than repetitively appear on different object regions.They assume that repetitive shapes on various regions are more prone to describe low-level textures (e.g. colors and edges), instead of high-level parts.In their code implementation, actually they are finding maximum (there are 2 methods, but simplest one is maximum) value in a feature map, then create a gaussian-like shape of mask (like Figure 3) same shape with the feature map (e.g. feature map has size of 6x6, then the template mask has size of 6x6), then perform element-wise multiplication with the mask and produced a new masked feature map (Figure 4). If maximum value is 0 in a feature map, then the template is considered as a negative template which means this filter does not activate for the object.1. feature map = a filter in a layer.2. The training data in this paper only contain one part/ object per image, if there are two same objects, the training might fail? Or the two same objects might have a bit difference and hence activated by two filters.I am too young to explain this, I can only tell my understanding on the loss function. Please read original paper for more details on these equations.TLDR: All these equations are still cing cong for me, for my understanding, the loss function push filter f to represent a specific object part of the category c and keep silent on images of other categories and feature map of a layer in a CNN not to be randomly activated by different region of an object and to have consistent distribution of activations.Architcture: AlexNet & VGG for simplicityThree benchmark datasets: Because they needed ground-truth annotations of object landmarks (parts) to evaluate the semantic clarity of each filter, they chose three benchmark datasets with landmark /part annotations for training and testing, including the ILSVRC 2013 DET Animal-Part dataset, the CUB200‚Äì2011 dataset, and the Pascal VOC Part database.They have achieved better result on part interpretability and location stability. Ordinary CNNs performed better in single-category classification. Whereas, for multi-category classification, interpretable CNNs exhibited superior performance to ordinary CNNs. The good performance in multi-category classification may be because that the clarification of filter semantics in early epochs reduced difficulties of filter learning in later epochs. For more results, please read in the original paper.Interpretable CNN has more consistent and understandable activations as compared to ordinary CNN. We can confirm that the specific filter in the top conv-layer represent head patterns of the specific animal.ReferenceCode: https://github.com/zqs1022/interpretableCNNPaper: Quanshi Zhang, Ying Nian Wu, and Song-Chun Zhu, ‚ÄúInterpretable Convolutional Neural Networks,‚Äù in CVPR 2018",30/03/2019,1,0,18,22,835,356,13,2,0,4,171
We are All Baby Shark (in Data Tracking),Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/we-are-all-baby-shark-in-data-tracking-20d6b5cd8418,Christian J. Ward,72,7,1348,"Data is amazing. You know that already. You‚Äôre told it every moment of every day. We are literally told or shown by ESPN, our kids report cards, our treadmills, our wristwatch, our Alexa, our Google, our Siri, our phones, and our apps that data is here and has the answer.In some cases this is accurate, but in many cases, data isn‚Äôt the answer. Actually, it doesn‚Äôt even describe the answer. Instead, it is a massive glut of content, numbers, and unstructured signals that require a lot more work to actually be useful.For example, take the use of telemetry‚Ä¶‚ÄúTelemetry is an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.‚Äù ‚Äî WikipediaI remember being absolutely fascinated as a kid by telemetry when it came to ‚Äútagging‚Äù animals in the wild to learn more about them as they travel and live their lives. One example of this has been the tracking of sharks as they traverse the oceans.In the last couple of years, this data on sharks (and where they may be headed) has sparked a lot of interest along the East Coast of the United States. Here‚Äôs a great example of the yellow line indicating the various path waypoints for this 91.5lb female white shark named Amagansett, as she travels between her work in Montauk and her summer home in New Jersey. She is literally a baby shark.Ocearch tracks whales, seals, sharks, and many other types of sea life as they make their way back and forth across the ocean. The tracking is available on their site and you can even sign up to follow certain sharks as they send in their telemetry data to the center.All of this comes together as a ton of data including, location, speed, depth, heart rate and other metrics in the hope that we can better understand these animals in their own environment. By tracking and storing all of this data, environmentalists and biologists hope to analyze and improve the understanding of these magnificent creatures, without disturbing them.The process of tagging an animal certainly has some momentary pain for the animal, and then they pretty much go about their lives and begin to transmit tons of data.In her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, Shoshana Zuboff does an excellent write up on telemetry and its origins and similarities to human tracking. Telemetry in the wild requires us to capture and forcibly attach a device to the animal. In the human realm, this happens in retail stores and on Amazon when we buy our fitness trackers. Sure, it‚Äôs a bit painful to pay the $600 for a top-notch tracker, but heck, I want to improve my fitness, so let‚Äôs go for it.About ten years ago, this was my Timex watch. It was before fitness tracking really took off. There were a few Garmin and Polar trackers back then, but they were like strapping a microwave to your wrist, so only the most die-hard triathletes used them. Most of us just used this type of stopwatch to keep track of how long we worked out. This Timex was a higher-end model because it actually stored something like the last 20 workouts, which amounted to exactly 40 data points total. Start. Stop. Start. Stop. Start. Stop.Truly high-tech.Today, I have this incredible Garmin Fenix watch. This watch tracks literally everything. Time, location, waypoints, direction, speed, cadence, pace, heart rate, elevation, VO2 Max (oxygen velocity), steps, weight, swim speed, and even your SWOLF. Never heard of SWOLF? It‚Äôs what you get if swimming and golf have a baby.To think how far these devices have come in such a brief period is amazing. I imagine they learned many of their algorithmic tricks from the classic use of telemetry in other fields of biology.Tracking all of this data is at first amazing to a data geek such as myself. However, after a few months of inspecting and analyzing the data, I came to understand two painful realizations.Gathering data is not the same as having an answer or an action plan. The reality is that data is helpful but it must be interpreted and turned into action by individuals. As it turns out, my findings personally are not that dissimilar to others, in that fitness tracking doesn‚Äôt have a drastic difference in the outcome.The reams and reams of data available from Garmin are impressive but what I realized is that I would analyze that data for a pretty decent amount of time each week. At the end of each workout and at least a few times a week, I‚Äôd review the data for anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. Add that up, and I could have actually used that time to work out, resulting in roughly one additional 45-minute workout a week. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but to give credit to the Timex stopwatch, finding the most important data points and focusing on those is sometimes more important than tracking everything.Being the geek that I am, I took the output from Garmin from one 8-mile run while visiting the Jersey Shore and began to analyze it. Garmin provides these beautiful dashboard views of the data it gathers workout by workout. You can view some combination of screens on your phone or desktop through their App.Not only am I not any healthier (point 1), but the amount of data I am producing and sharing back to Garmin is astounding. Additionally, Garmin reminds me regularly that, if I want to, I can link Garmin to my Apple Health App and other platforms to get the most out of all of this data.So I decided to export all of the underlying data from this one workout into a CSV file, where I then converted the data to plain text. I wanted to see, in more human terms, just how much data am I providing back on a single workout. Naturally, I was expecting a few pages of content, but what I found was that this single workout, when imported into a Google document was 396 pages long (single-spaced text.)Look, this is disturbing. One jog at the shore sent more pages of personal data to a third-party (and probably others) than all the pages in my first book, Data Leverage, Unlocking the Surprising Growth Potential of Data Partnerships. In fact, it was almost double the length of our book which is wholly depressing. Thank goodness I didn‚Äôt go for a stroll along the beach this time.I love my watch. I am fascinated at the capabilities to track all of this data, but at this point, I am literally no different from any animal being tracked in the wild. And while the general understanding of tracking baby shark is to learn and help protect these creatures, the data we are all sharing with companies is used for little more than to target us with additional marketing and sales.Again, I am not saying there isn‚Äôt value here. There is for sure. But at some point, you need to question whether we need all of this data. Ask yourself:Am I really better off because of this data?Am I making better decisions with this data?Would far less data be just as useful to me in my decision making?Who else is getting all of this data, and what are they using it for?After a couple of decades in the data business, all I can say is that more data doesn‚Äôt always equate to better decisions. I‚Äôve seen it time and time again. Sure, it can, but most of the time storing massive quantities of data ends up in piles of unused database records with little to no purpose for existence. In the old days, we were taught ‚ÄúSave everything!, Data storage is cheap!‚Äù but in this new age of data minimization and GDPR-like regulations, it is time that you evaluated all of the data you are creating and sharing as a baby shark.Originally published at wardpllc.com on March 30, 2019.

How a hackathon can help founders find their purpose,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-inner-path-to-becoming-sensai-9422a23cc7fe,Arjan Haring,589,5,720,"Recently I did a proof of concept hackathon with Yama characterizes himself as a ‚Äúcrazy development economist‚Äù. When he was young, his family had to leave Afghanistan and they ended up in the Netherlands where he became a succesful student. Yama first studied electrical engineering then economics, but there was something missing. After his studies, in search of his ikigai, he drove all the way from the Netherlands to Afghanistan to give kids boxing lessons.‚ÄúTechnology is just a medium to get the message across.‚ÄùHe then realized that through sports you can empower this generation to become more resilient and you can even inspire them to be true changemakers. With a touch of irony, martial arts could lead to a peaceful society with less violence and competition. Technology is just a medium to get the message across. But what is the message?Yama is one of a kind, with an energy that matches mine (almost), he is someone you can not not like. He sees connections everywhere and gets almost everyone excited about his ideas. And his ideas are great, if you ask me. Normally people would say someone like Yama needs to focus to be more effective. That could be true, but that most probably doesn‚Äôt make him happy.In the process of our hackathon Yama‚Äôs ideas were made tangible. One team wanted to work on his idea of a circular boxing bag that would help both the problem of used car tires and that of obesity in working class neighborhoods. And another team start working on the idea to gamify boxing, both for professional and private use.To run a sustainable, as in long term viable, company you need a robust busines model. That much is certain. So the tendency of millenials to work on something that is ‚Äúgood for the world‚Äù still needs to be matched by a revenue model. There are too many nice initiatives that don‚Äôt last because there is no clear revenue model. Volunteering or bootstrapping is often not a sustainable model.To run a sustainable, as in long term viable, company you need a robust business model.Thinking by doing is a wellknown strategy in a lot of disciplines, for example in electrical engineering. But this is not yet a very common approach to the art of living. And in some cases, like finding a life partner, you want to take a more conservative approach and think more before you do.‚Äúa failed startup is even considered a positive addition to your resume‚ÄùBut in your working life I would argue you have quite a lot of flexibility to test things out. Is it something you like doing? Is it something you see yourself doing in 10 years still? Job hopping is more and more accepted, and a failed startup is even considered a positive addition to your resume (lucky me üòú).So why not test with life a little?So why not test with life a little? Enjoy the different things it has to offer and better prepare yourself for choices that have great impact on your life.During the hackathon in the proof of concept lab Yama has a special relationship with 5 time World Champion Thai boxing Yucel Fidan. Yucel is one of the persons that sees the great things that SensAI could be part of. And Yama would like to learn how to be a champion like Yucel, albeit in a different arena.For me it was an incredible honor to be part of the follow-up day of the SensAI hackathon as well that was hosted at Fidan Gym. Yucel is an incredibly balanced champion. Having worked hard myself, I am always in awe of people that managed to metaphorically move mountains, made a small dent in the universe and stayed true to themselves no matter what.I am not sure what choices Yama will take in the nearby future. But I hope, and I am pretty sure, he stays true to himself. I have a feeling that the proof of concepts have given him more grip on what the effects are of the choices he makes as an entrepreneur for his own life.I am very grateful to have worked with Yama for my first proof of concept session at JADS. And it might not surprise you we are already planning a new proof of concept session soon. Stay tuned, stay SensAI.",31/03/2019,0,0,0,1,1050,654,5,0,0,8,104
Wild Wide AI: responsible data science,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/wild-wide-ai-responsible-data-science-16b860e1efe9,"Michel Kana, Ph.D",5200,9,1495,"Data Science can do good things for us: it improves life, it makes things more efficient, more effective and leads to a better experience. There are however some miss-steps that data-driven analysis has already exhibited. Here are few examples where data science tools were intentionally or unintentionally misused:It is often claimed that data science is algorithmic and therefore cannot be biased. And yet, we saw examples above where all traditional evils of discrimination exhibit themselves in the data science ecosystem. Bias is inherited both in the data and in the process, is propelled and amplified.Transparency is an idea, a mindset, a set of mechanisms that can help prevent discrimination, enable public debate and establish trust. When we make data science, we interact with society. The way we do decisions has to be in an environment where we have trust from the participants, from the public. Technology alone won‚Äôt solve the issue. User engagement, policy efforts are important.Aspects of responsibility in the data science ecosystem include: fairness, transparency, diversity and data protection. The area of responsible data science is very new but is already at the edge of all the top machine learning conferences because these are difficult but interesting and relevant problems.What is Fairness?Philosophers, lawyers, sociologists have been asking this question for many years. In the data science context we usually solve the task of predictive analytics, predicting future performance or behavior based on some past or present observation (dataset). Statistical bias occurs when models used to solve such tasks do not fit the data very well. A biased model is somehow imprecise and does not summarize the data correctly. Societal bias happens when the data or the model does not represent the world correctly. An example occurs when the data is not representative. This is the case if we only used the data for police going to the SAME neighborhood over and over, and we use this information only about crime from those particular neighborhoods. Societal bias can also be caused by how we define world. Is it the world as it is that we are trying to impact with predictive analytics or the world as it should be? Who should determine what the world should be like?What is discrimination?In most legal systems, there are two concepts defining discrimination:When we talk about discrimination, we are using terms which could be uncomfortable, such as racism, gender, sexual orientation. Political correctness in the extreme sense has no place in these debates about responsible data science. We have to be able to name concepts to be able to talk about them. Once we can talk about those concepts, we can take corrective action.Technical definition of fairnessLet‚Äôs consider vendors who are assigning outcomes to members of a population. This is the most basic case, a binary classification. Positive outcomes may be: offered employment, accepted to school, offered a loan, offered a discount. Negative outcomes may be: denied employment, rejected from school, denied a loan, not offered a discount. What we worry about in fairness is how outcome is assigned to members of a population. Let‚Äôs assume that 40% got the positive outcome. Some sub-population however may be treated differently by this process. Let‚Äôs assume that we know ahead of time what the sub-population is, for example red haired people. Thus we can divide our population into two groups: people with red hair, and people without red hair. In our example we observe that while 40% of the population got the positive outcome, only 20% of red haired received the positive outcome. 60% of the other received the positive outcome. Here, according to some definition, we observe disparate impact on the group of red haired individuals. Another way to denote this situation is that statistical parity fails. This is a baseline definition of fairness without conditioning. There is quite some sophistication about using such assessment in real-life, for example in courts. This basic definition of fairness, written into many laws around the globe, dictates that demographics of the individuals receiving any outcome are the same as demographics of the underlying population.Assessing disparate impactThe vendor could say that he actually did not intend or did not look at all at hair color, which happens to be the sensitive attribute in the dataset. Instead the vendor would say that he decided to give the positive outcome to people whose hair is long. The vendor is denying the accusation and saying that he is not discriminating based on hair color. The thing is that the vendor has adversely impacted red haired people. It is not the intention that we care about, but the effect on the sub-population. In other words, blinding is not a legal or ethical excuse. Removing hair color from vendor‚Äôs process on outcome assignment does not prevent discrimination from occurring. Disparate impact is legally assessed on the impact, not on the intention.Mitigating disparate impactIf we detect a violation of statistical parity, we may want to mitigate. In an environment in which we have a number of positive outcomes which we can assign, we have to swap some outcomes. We have to take a positive outcome from somebody in the not-red haired group and give it to someone else in the red haired group. Not everyone will agree with swapping outcomes. An individual who used to get the positive outcome would stop getting it any more. This would lead to individual fairness. It stipulates that any two individuals who are similar within a particular task should receive similar outcomes. There is a tension between group and individual fairness that is not easy to resolve.Individual vs group fairnessAn example in which individual fairness and group fairness was taken to the supreme court appears in the Ricci v. DeStefano case in 2009. Firefighters took a test for promotion, and the department threw out the test results because none of the black firefighters scored high enough to be promoted. The fire department was afraid that they could be sued for discrimination and disparate impact if they were to admit results and not promote any black firefighter. But then the lawsuit was brought by the firefighters who would have been eligible for promotion but who weren‚Äôt promoted as a result of this. There was an individual fairness argument, a disparate treatment argument. They argued that race was used to negatively impact them. This case was ruled in favor of white firefighters, in favor of individual fairness.Individual fairness is equality, everybody gets the same box to reach the tree. Group fairness is the equity view, everybody gets as many boxes as they need to be able to reach the tree. Equity costs more because society has to invest more. These are two intrinsically different world views that we cannot logically decide which one is better. These are just two different points of view, there isn‚Äôt a better one. They go back to what we believe a world as it is, is a world as it should be. The truth is going to be somewhere in the middle. It is important to understand which kinds of mitigation are consistent with which kinds of belief systems.Friedler et. al. tease out the difference between beliefs about fairness andmechanisms that logically follow from those beliefs in their paper from 2016. The construct space is intrinsically the state of the world. It is made of things we cannot directly measure such as intelligence, grit, propensity to commit crime and risk-adverseness. We however want to measure intelligence and grit when we decide who to admit to college. We want to know the propensity of a person to recommit crime and his risk-adverseness in justice. These are raw properties which are exhibited and not directly accessible. Instead we look at the observed space where there are proxies, which are to a greater or lesser degree aligned with the properties that we want to measure. For intelligence the proxy would be SAT score, grit would be measured by high-school GPA, propensity to commit crime by family history and risk-adverseness by age. The decision space is then made of what we would like to decide: performance in college and recidivism.Fairness is defined here as a mapping from the construct space to the decision space, via the observe space. Individual fairness (equality) believes that the observed space faithfully represents the construct space. For example high-school GPA is a good measure of grit. Therefore the mapping from construct to decision space has low distortion. Group fairness (equity) however says that there is a systematic distortion caused by structural bias, society bias when going from the construct space to observed space. Furthermore this distortion aligns with groups structure, with membership in protected groups in our society. In other words the society systematically discriminates.to be continued ‚Ä¶References: lecture on responsible data science at Harvard University by Prof. Julia Stoyanovich (New York University) ‚Äî selected chapters from ‚Äú The Age of Surveillance Capitalism‚Äù book by Shoshana Zuboff ‚Äî thoughts from ‚ÄúWhat worries me about AI‚Äù post by Fran√ßois Chollet.",30/03/2019,0,0,12,1,512,252,4,2,0,6,10
Applied AI: Going From Concept to ML Components,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-ai-going-from-concept-to-ml-components-7ae9c5d823d3,Abraham Kang,69,6,1197,"Opening your mind to different ways of applying machine learning to the real world. By Abraham Kang with special thanks to Kunal Patel and Jae Duk Seo for being a sounding board and providing input for this article.Many people are interested in automating redundant processes within the organization using AI. Let‚Äôs start with a concrete problem, what I noticed is that lawyers typically gather facts from clients when something bad happens. These facts form the basis of causes of action (negligence, battery, assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress) that an individual can sue on. Once the causes of action have been determined based on legal justification and the facts, a complaint is written up and submitted to the court for commencement of the legal action. The complaint is a legal document which sets out the facts giving rise to a legal basis for taking action against another party. Manually creating this document can be time consuming and similar facts result in similar causes of action. For example, if someone hits another person there is usually a ‚Äúbattery‚Äù. If someone accidentally hurts someone else or someone slips and falls within a store there could be an action for negligence. Based in this problem we have a customer who would like to use AI to learn how to write a complaint from a fact paragraph describing what happened.Trying to get AI/ML to read facts and figure out a way for AI/ML to write a whole complaint might be biting off more than the model can chew and may be an effort that would take years to solve. However, if you take the time to understand and think about the underlying problem, you can find existing techniques (with some slight modifications) that could be used to solve different pieces of the puzzle. For example, when you look at a complaint it starts with a description of the parties and their positions (plaintiff vs defendant) as well as counsel representing them. There may be a class action section, a justification of jurisdiction (does court have power over parties), description of the parties, a justification of venue (are we in the proper court location), a listing of the causes of action, and description of the facts. When you look at the sections you have to think about where the data that is going to build the individual sections is going to come from. In certain cases you will not have an answer but if you look carefully you will see patterns and correlations between different sections of the complaint. This will allow you to think about what your inputs to the neural network will be and the candidate outputs.We don‚Äôt have any data per se but there may be a way to parse the facts out of all existing complaints and use them as the input for our neural network. Every complaint that is submitted to the court becomes public information so there will be plenty of data. This solution will require attorneys to write their facts as if they were inserting them directly into the complaint, but this is a minor inconvenience to be able to have machine learning provide generated complaints. Generating a complete complaint may be difficult. So let‚Äôs break the problem down.Logically how would you break the generation of a document down into smaller pieces? Well you need to look at one so here is an example: https://www.heise.de/downloads/18/1/8/9/1/3/4/6/NP-v-Standard-Innovation-Complaint.pdf. To make it interesting I picked a maker of adult toys so it might peak your curiosity. Basically, we want to eventually generate a complaint (above pdf) from the facts provided by a lawyer. So if you look at the document and at other complaints you will find similar patterns as to structure.So what do you think would be the best way to break things down‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt scroll down until you have had time to think about it.‚Ä¶.Really think about it‚Ä¶..Well if you said to break things down by section using templating, then this would be the route that would probably be best.When you break down a complaint there are causes of action listed in the complaint. Each cause of action (violation of Federal Wiretap Act, Illinois Eavesdropping Statute, Intrusion upon Seclusion, Unjust Enrichment, Fraud and Deceptive Business Practice Act, etc.) has supporting rules and justification based on the facts. So now there are two problems. How do you come up with the causes of action from the facts text and how do you generate the supporting text under each cause of action?When we look at the facts of the case we need to find all of the causes of action (laws that were broken) that we could sue on. There are no direct solutions for finding causes of action from text so we will have to think more fundamentally.What existing techniques do you think we can use to look at text and infer meaning or a description of the text. If you said multi-label text classification or multi-label sentiment analysis, then you are ahead of the game (https://paperswithcode.com/task/text-classification, https://paperswithcode.com/task/sentiment-analysis). Analyzing text to determine its associated causes of action is a similar process to classifying text or finding the sentiment of related text. There are associated problems like the fact that causes of action will need to be updated as laws are introduced. There may be an alternate way to create an embedding for the facts and then tie the causes of action to the facts based on triplet (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) or quadruplet loss (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01719.pdf) to push causes of action sharing similar words together in the embedding space and unrelated causes of action further apart. Then use a clustering technique to find causes of action close to determinative word embeddings used in the supporting argument associated with the words in the individual cause of action sections of the complaint.Now that you have figured out how to get the high level causes of action from the text, how can you generate the supporting argument text for each of the individual cause of action sections (violation of Federal Wiretap Act, Illinois Eavesdropping Statute, Intrusion upon Seclusion, Unjust Enrichment, Fraud and Deceptive Business Practice Act, etc.)?This one is not so straight forward. Think about a what neural network architectures which generate text (Don‚Äôt scroll down until you have some ideas)‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶.Open your mind‚Ä¶.Use the Force‚Ä¶.Text generation algorithms (https://paperswithcode.com/task/data-to-text-generation, https://paperswithcode.com/area/nlp/text-generation) might be an option but even the best ones create gibberish often. The better alternative might be to use an architecture like neural networks involved in translation (https://paperswithcode.com/task/machine-translation, https://paperswithcode.com/task/unsupervised-machine-translation, https://paperswithcode.com/paper/unsupervised-clinical-language-translation). In addition, it might be a good idea to have a separate ‚Äútranslation‚Äù neural network for each cause of action to help each neural network focus on identifying the key facts used in generating a supporting argument for each cause of action.It is probably going to be a good idea to run the candidate text for the supporting argument text for each cause of action through a grammar checker/fixer (https://paperswithcode.com/task/grammatical-error-correction). This way any blatant mess ups are fixed.I hope you learned how to apply the machine learning solutions more broadly. Let me know if you get stuck as I would definitely be interested in hearing about problems that people are trying to solve with machine learning.",30/03/2019,2,0,1,0,1050,640,2,0,0,12,107
"Card Sorting ‚Äî what, how & the perks",UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/card-sorting-what-how-the-perks-29f6cb020270,Saurav Pandey,92,4,458,"Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate information architecture. In a typical card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and group them accordingly. To conduct a card sort, you can use actual cards, pieces of paper, or one of several online card-sorting software tools.Different types of techniques used for card sorting:Open ‚Äî In open card sorting, each participant is given a stack of cards.The participants are then asked to group those cards together in any way they want. Then they create labels for the groups that they chose. This method is commonly used for new/existing information architectures (IA) or organizing products on a site.Closed ‚Äî In a closed card sorting, the researchers create the labels for their respective groups. Participants are given a stack of cards and are asked to put each card into a group. This method is normally used when adding new content to an existing site or gaining a second round of insights after an open card sort.Card sorting can also be done either remotely or face to face.Remote ‚ÄîRemote card sorting sessions are computer-based sessions in which participants work independently on their own personal systems. Open or Closed card sorts both can be done remotely. Several software programs exist to help you with large-scale remote card-sorting studies.Using the software is an advantage because it analyzes the data for you.Most preferred card sorting toolFace to face‚ÄîThis type of sorting session happens in person where an impartial observer is present. Participants are provided with a set of cards and they think aloud while sorting, giving a clearer picture of their reactions and thought processes. The observer has the opportunity to clarify any observations they are unsure of to gain a better insight into why the user has made those choices.Once collected, the data is analyzed to identify common trends. This is done by using cluster analysis software or if the sample size is small, by inputting the data into a spreadsheet to see if there are any patterns in the groupings or labeling.Card sorting is a great technique but it‚Äôs not always the right technique for UX research. However, when using card sorting along with other UX methods such as usability testing it can help you to find out some functional info about users to get new projects up and running. One should always spend enough time weighing up the benefits and problems before selecting any kind of UX research technique.Thank you for reading my first blog.

How we use InVision Freehand to journey map together,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/how-we-use-invision-freehand-to-journey-map-together-33257f2286d8,Mike Kuechenmeister,123,6,1084,"Working remotely can be a wonderful thing. However, collaborating between individual remote workers and co-located teams can be problematic. As part of our ACST design process, a handful of our design activities are much richer if they are done with a group of people. Somewhere along the beginning of most projects, we do some version of a design workshop. A particular pain point for our team is the collaborative journey map exercise.Previously, our best idea was to try to have the workshop facilitator travel to the largest, closest team of co-located participants. Everyone gets a meeting invite, project summary (requirements, scenarios, research), and agenda. The facilitator and co-located team gather in a large room with a whiteboard, markers, and stacks of sticky notes. Then remote participants joined via hangout. The problem with this approach is twofold:Not only would they have to request that someone in the room write their idea on the board, they typically did not have a good view of what was already on the board. This left them trying to catch enough of the dialogue to stay on the train of thought and greatly marginalized as a contributor.One would assume those in the room together would be highly engaged, but it typically didn‚Äôt go that way. These sort of group workshops are foreign to how most participants are used to working. Sorting out strategy and ideation through conversation and sticky notes in front of a group made most participants retreat rather than engage with the process. This leaves the facilitator trying desperately to draw out the team.Several times we tried using online collaborative tools with varying degrees of success. Some are more structured, like tools where you create and arrange sticky notes. Some are free-form like InVision Freehand. We struggled to find a tool that was the right degree of structured and open. The biggest challenge of InVision Freehand is the lack of structure. Its collection of symbols is pretty sparse and drawing isn‚Äôt intuitive which is a dealbreaker for most participants. We muddled through a few sessions which typically fell into the old style of everyone watching the facilitator tap dance. A handful of engaged individuals would try to pull it all together.Along the way, we‚Äôve found a few keys to making these sessions more successful:Sitting remotely at a computer in another time zone is very different from sitting together sans computers in a conference room. Use a shared platform regardless of location.Google Hangouts isn‚Äôt perfect but connecting via video at least allows for some degree of personal connection. We rely on non-verbals to enrich communication, hopefully even create a sense of trust and empathy. A tool that allows remote collaboration while still allowing us to see each other is helpful.Writing an idea on a sticky note and putting it on a whiteboard doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal. But it can be if it is your first time doing this with a group of people. It is easy to be self-conscious about your idea, your handwriting, your appearance, lots of things that create small barriers to engagement. We live on computers which provide the opportunity to remove these small barriers.The same meeting invite, summary, and agenda go out. But now all participants bring a laptop regardless of location. Camera and a large screen still allow us to see each other via Google Hangout. The co-located team still gets the value of interacting and being together.Previous attempts we tried to create all the structure on the fly. One of our talented designers came up with a simple but amazing idea. The gamechanger is preparing key screens within the Freehand document that structure our conversation.We typically start a journey mapping session with an activity to help the team build empathy. It's challenging but important that participants disconnect a little from the hurried and focused nature of their daily work to approach the journey map activity from the customer‚Äôs perspective as much as possible.We use XPLANE‚Äôs excellent empathy map. The activity is not scientific. However, we have some existing persona work and the team has hopefully had the opportunity to visit customers.The thing about this example that makes my heart happy is seeing the breadth and degree of engagement.This wasn‚Äôt a painful act of drawing people out to engage. It was more like play. Making great product design feel more like play is a rich and untapped resource.When I saw that happen, I knew right away we were on to something.Our journey map is based on the process outlined by Harry Brignul. We feel its a great way to capture the journey in with an actionable amount of detail but a lot of other really good and useful stuff. We work through a list of scenarios. Some are their own unique journey but most are similar with subtle differences (like journeying a ‚Äúcreate‚Äù vs. ‚Äúedit‚Äù flow).Again, the amazing thing here is the degree to which participants feel they are free to engage and interact.The completed journey map is a powerful thing. Not only is it critical to approach the project as a journey (rather than just pages), but doing it collaboratively captures a greater breadth of ideas and aligns the team going forward.Keep in mind that great design is not simply the aggregate of everyone‚Äôs ideas. Collecting lots of ideas and input is important, but it is equally important to curate those ideas and focus on constructive exploration.We love whiteboards and sticky notes. But we have found they are often a barrier for collaborating with remote participants. This new approach allows us to drive greater participation, more active engagement, and a larger and richer pool of ideas to draw from.Collaborating this way is actually kinda fun. Seeing activity in the form of each other‚Äôs butterfly‚Äôish cursers flutter across the screen and put down ideas has the effect of creating a sort of contagious creative energy.This InVision Freehand link also serves as a design artifact to refer back to. This same board will serve to handle our team brainstorming and other design activities. We typically do thumbnails, upload photos, perform idea review and dot voting on the board. The tedious task of documenting all these activities is eliminated as the working document serves as the artifact.I have no doubt that both workflow and tools will continue to evolve as the community of practice continues to evolve. But for us, right now, this serves our needs pretty well. If you have tools or process you‚Äôve found success with, I‚Äôd love to hear about them.",30/03/2019,0,0,4,0,1410,839,5,0,0,3,65
Introducing Gravity ‚Äî a Product Design case study,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-gravity-a-ux-case-study-579467264bf5,Louis Moody,183,6,869,"Role: Research, Product DesignContributors: Louis MoodyDate: 29/03/19Money is important. The future is important. Have you ever thought of the future of money and the opportunities there are with innovation in technology? Well, I have. I believe pushing the bounds between innovation and tangible design by creating useful and valuable products to empower people to lead better lives.Gravity is a self-initiated mobile-only banking concept that imagines experiences you won‚Äôt find in an ordinary bank. Designing the use of AI, well crafted UX and beautiful UI design. Gravity is the bank of the future.I divide my process into the following structure. Makes it easier to communicate my rationale. (But you probably already know that by now.)We‚Äôre all visual thinkers.‚Äã Most of the time we have to see something for us to understand it. By creating visuals (in my case some rough sketches) I can take the research discovered from an idea into a üåü North Star, sometimes in the form of ‚Äúproblem statement‚Äù that can keep me on a stable path for product delivery.‚ÄúI need my bank not only to be a safe environment to store my money but to help me save my money, get the maximum out of my money and to even help me earn more money.‚ÄùI‚Äôll begin by showing you what I did. Then, we‚Äôll move on to how I did it.For a smoother, safer and pretty much more fun banking experience, I needed to establish some core guiding principles.I carefully chose a dominantly black and white colour palette with the exception of harmonious pastels. The font was considered due to its impact across all applications while keeping it easy to read. Being a Google font makes it highly recognisable.People interact with mobile experiences differently.Knowing this, I had some real fun when creating innovative custom animations with Framer X.I used my learnings from research and development (we‚Äôll get on to that later) that both served the User Interface and business goals.When designing the experience and interactions of a product, my focus and objective are to get the user to her desired destination with as little work as possible. To do this, I need to discover what the secrets are at the core of her problem, define objectives and then expand outwards.I set off to learn about how FinTech is challenging the banking system. Money is important, to all of us. I used my learnings to drive this work of creating a brand that both served people with fairness and clarity.100% of users are people. Focusing on the mindset we share with each other, I created two separate user persona‚Äôs based on intuition and assumption. knowing who the people you‚Äôre designing for and what they‚Äôre about is the best way to create value.Building scenario‚Äôs put‚Äôs the user journey in context. I create multiple scenarios that apply to the person using the product circumstance outside the scope of using the product.When I‚Äôm creating a new project or product, it‚Äôs pretty important that I understand the context of use the user will experience with the product. To help me do that, I create simple user journey maps like this.Summarising the research and user persona‚Äôs, I created multiple empathy maps and developed the following considerations:Sketching ideas, prototyping and testing was the perfect balance creation and reaching the objectives. Sketching helped me create a lot of different versions before reaching the final decision.The solutions resulted in three different scenarios. You can watch the flows/iterations and read my rationale below.Prototypes made with Framer X.The solution I arrived for setting your budget is a pretty simple one that can be achieved in two ways. One with manual interaction by the user, the other is a command said to Issac, which he gracefully accomplishes with ease.Cleverly designed AI will create segments of your transactions and give tips on which payments can be amended to save you money.Great apps utilise the power of other apps. Why try and re-invent the wheel? Do the one thing well and harness the power of other platforms who are also the best version of themselves. Just like a sports team; that‚Äôs exactly what this flow intends to express.Time is money ‚Äî and I would have spent a lot to discover the type of data required to make an accurate execution of the user needs and experience. Most of the data collected were discovered on the web such as Monzo, WSJ, Starling Bank, Revolut and Wealth Simple.Reading loads about people, and money really helped me understand the current state and how people feel about money, banking and finance. But this amount of qualitative data is pretty impractical without the quantitate data to compare it with. As a consequence of this, most of the rationale was based on personal experiences and opinions from publications which led to more assumptions than I‚Äôd like to use for designing experience for people.One thing is clear to me though, that 2019 is most likely to maximise the usage of intelligent machine learning algorithms that provide optimal experiences, which is much more personalised, and the assistants more approachable.Hi, I‚Äôm Louis Moody.I‚Äôm a product designer from Shoreditch, London.Check out my Dribbble, Instagram and Twitter to see my UI designs, follow my process and to stay in the loop.",30/03/2019,0,0,4,1,1056,650,15,1,0,11,322
Is the chatbot a hype of the past? What are the key takeaways?,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/is-the-chatbot-a-hype-of-the-past-what-are-the-key-takeaways-3922a6895500,Takuma Kakehi,159,10,1923,"Facebook debuted its Messenger bot platform in April 2016, and Google announced its Google Assistant in May 2016. During this time, I was on the team that launched The Wall Street Journal bot, which partnered with Facebook, and I witnessed how people‚Äôs expectations got so inflated.Unlike regular mobile apps, users can interact with these bots in chat interfaces. It is an easy-to-understand metaphor for how AI (artificial intelligence) is becoming so human-like. People imagined themselves interacting with these bots just as if the bots were their friends and families.Chatbots are not a new concept; people had already created Twitter bots for ages. People loved talking about fun bots in their early days, though these bots are seen much more negatively today, associated with being the noise of the internet or consisting of fake accounts pretending to be humans.In this regard, 2016 was special. Large platformers like Facebook and Google formally announced that they will support business owners to build chatbots on their platforms. More importantly, they presented promising use cases that are natural to peoples‚Äô everyday lives.People don‚Äôt need to download a separate appThis is the biggest advantage of building chatbots on these large platforms. Conversations with bots can take place on their widely adopted messaging apps. Service providers don‚Äôt need to make an app or website on their own or separately. Not needing to download any additional apps from the App Store is important; If this wasn‚Äôt the case, huge marketing efforts would be required to get users to install these apps, alongside product efforts to keep users coming back to the app.Chatbots can be a simple and cheap optionFrameworks provided by larger platformers can help service providers build basic bots with much less effort than would otherwise have been necessary to build conventional apps or websites from scratch.Chatbots on these platforms can provide better access to NPL (Natural processing languages)NYU hosted a consumer study on IVR (Interactive voice response) systems back in 2011. The study showed that 83% of people didn‚Äôt find IVR systems useful, unless they were able to understand and respond to straight-forward questions (Consumer Study Finds Overwhelming Dissatisfaction with IVR). Chatbots without NPL may be as useless as these legacy IVR systems. However, by running bots on tech giants‚Äô frameworks, they have better access to advanced AIs, addressing this issue.Message UI is optimal for mobile experienceSome of the first display interactions on mobile devices were short text messages. Since then, chat UIs evolved to naturally fit into users‚Äô mobile experience.An example of this is that the chat UI is great for going back through one‚Äôs conversation history. You just need to swipe up on your mobile device to revisit content of a recent message.Together with voice interactions such as Echo, Google Home and Siri, the growth of conversational interactions has suggested great prospects for this trend. For example, Amazon announced that more than 100 million Echo and other Alexa pre-installed devices were sold by 2018. Additionally, eMarketer, a market research company, previously estimated that there will be 17.2 million buyers using smart speakers in US by 2018 , and 25.6 million by 2020.As stated previously, the growth of both chat and voice technology depends on the improvements of NPL. Moreover, the growth of voice and chat bots do and will continue to complement each other.Today, MAUs (Monthly Active Users) of major messaging apps surpassed MAUs of some of major social media apps. For instance, the growth of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger has been steady, while that of Snapchat and Twitter is hitting a plateau. The more frequently users open messaging apps, the more opportunities there are for users to engage with chatbots. The growth of chatbots has been predicted to grow at a pace similar to that of websites in the late 1990s.Projected chatbot growth based on 200% growth rate. Historical website statistics from Internet Live Stats (Graph is reposted from Chatbots Magazine)Now, I would like to address pros and cons for chat UIs in more details, and I hope to reflect these findings for future projects to come.In comparison to mobile apps with rich graphical interfaces, chat UIs require users to take more steps to find what they want.The retail brand, Spring, was one of the initiators on the messenger platform with a well-executed bot. Their bot showed the world the potential for a conversational shopping experience inside a chat UI. There, users were asked a series of questions such as gender, product types, styles, etc. to find the product they want. However, because retail categories are nested deeply, users had to answer many questions in order to see even a preliminary product list.Additionally, it is not intuitive to start a new search while users are already deeply enthralled in an existing conversation. Although Spring‚Äôs chatbot was brilliant, browsing nested items could be done much quicker in a regular app or website.As stated, chat UIs are limited in their ability to provide intuitive interaction options, which other websites or apps provide. To address this issue, Facebook and Google have provided richer UI options as well as intuitive access to web-view in order to supplement interactions only by text.For example, Facebook introduced the 2.1 platform with a rich payment interface in July 2017. A new SDK (Software Development Kit) enables users to make payments via a one-step process in Messenger‚Äôs webview. This feature can also show payment details that are hard to keep compact without this UI format.In regular chat styles, if users have to type in a message to reply to a chat, they are required to use additional brain resources to keep an interaction going than if they weren‚Äôt required to do so. Additionally, free text inputs are often in too random of formats for the system to understand correctly. For example, I often don‚Äôt get my desired results when I try to search for a video on my Google Home only with my voice. To address this issue, Facebook and Google introduced Quick and Smart Reply respectively. The quick or smart reply is a list of suggested responses to allow conversations to flow smoothly.The smart reply is adopted widely into a variety of Google chat base products. In Gmail, users can start writing a response by tapping one of the smart reply options. The name ‚Äúsmart‚Äù suggests Google‚Äôs seeming emphasis on anticipating responses ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù, based on user behaviors. Contrastingly, the name ‚Äúquick‚Äù reply by Facebook, implies that their options are pre-sets and meant for quicker responses. Additionally, these UI elements give unique advantages to a visual chat UI in contrast to voice chat UIs like Alexa or Google Home.Bot applications can exist alongside users‚Äô everyday conversations. In fact, this provides one of the strongest advantages for bots that run on the messaging platforms. These platforms put immense effort into making user sharing to friends and family as seamless as possible.To this regard, users can directly access various bots from regular conversations with friends in Facebook Messenger, for example. Users need to simply tap a plus icon which opens a drawer with a list of suggested bots. Once they select a bot, they will have access to unique functions that the bot provides, which enriches their conversation with their friend.As shown in the screens below, OpenTable, for example, lets users reserve a table at a restaurant and share the information within a conversation with their friend.It is even more powerful when bots are suggested effortlessly within regular conversations with others. For example, the example below shows how an Uber ride can be suggested simultaneously as users talk about a given location on Facebook Messenger.Alternatively, Google Allo lets users add a Google Assistant in a regular conversation. For instance, the example below shows how Google Assistant can insert information relevant to a conversation; a list of restaurants can be suggested if users are talking about a dinner plan per se.Ultimately, chat UIs are most suited for when a conversation is the most comfortable format for users to interact in. In a survey by Moxie Software, 62% of customers expect live chat on their mobile devices when going on websites, and if available, 82% would use it (Source: ICMI). Evidently, quick and articulate help could drastically improve overall customer satisfaction.The average customer service call makes people wait, on hold, for quite a long time. The chat as an alternative, could at least suggest answers to frequently asked questions instantaneously ‚Äî in fact, according to IBM, up to 80% of routinely asked questions can be automated. Additionally, a chat on a display is less stressful than having to wait for a long time to get a response. Moreover, according to Harris Research (ICMI), 53% of customers prefer interacting with an online chat rather than calling for support.Today, many customer service chats are a hybrid of automated responses and human-operations. This hybrid solution is most optimal for a better customer experience with reasonable operation cost. Users want quick responses and 80% of routinely asked questions may be solved instantaneously with automated responses. For the rest, the system can switch to human operators to provide more sincere support.A concierge service is another unique opportunity that bots have. Kik, a messaging platform from Canada, released bots under their fashion categories, featuring key brands such as SEPHORA, H&M, and Victoria‚Äôs Secret.The new proposition is for users to have one-on-one interactions with these bots. In addition, users can invite friends to chat conversations to ask for friends‚Äô advice, for example. Also, retailers can learn about customers‚Äô preferences through their interactions and personalization options. The service provides a great monetizing opportunity for loyal customers purchasing items directly on the platform.However, most bots today are still too premature to take full advantage of chat UIs that are well-evolved for human conversations. The premature bots that only routinely update content wouldn‚Äôt make the interactions as vibrant as the conversations with your friends. For example, I find it more useful if the concierge bot is not use by each brand, but rather having one concierge bot that suggests products from a variety of brands.All in all, the role of a given platform is extremely imperative to pushing this bot trend to the next level. In early 2018, Facebook discontinued its virtual assistant and M. Google discontinued Allo as well. This news implies how these bots are not mature yet and are not straightforward enough for people to talk to directly. Voice has a unique advantage, because it‚Äôs completely hands-free. I am looking forward to applying this knowledge to future applications and seeing how these bots will become more practical and useful as time goes on.Original post: http://www.ta-kuma.com/product-design/is-the-chatbot-a-hype-of-the-past-what-are-the-key-takeaways/Chatbot Report 2018: Global Trends and Analysis | Chatbot MagazineThe Rise Of Intelligent Conversational UI | Smashing MagazineCustomer service and virtual assistant bots will be prevalent for online businesses in many markets | BI IntelligenceFacebook Is Shutting Down M, Its AI Concierge | BuzzFeed newsA Google R&D team wants to bring Smart Reply to all your chat apps | TechCrunchMarketing in the Age of Alexa | Harvard Business ReviewVoice Commerce‚Äôs Growing Pains | eMarketerAmazon joins the chatbot conversation: BI IntelligenceMore than 100 million Alexa devices have been sold | TechCrunchMessenger Platform 2.1 Brings a Seamless Payments Process, New Call-to-Action Buttons | AdWeekTHE MESSAGING APPS REPORT: Messaging apps are now bigger than social networks | BI IntelligenceFacebook‚Äôs new chatbots still need work | TechCrunchWhy No One Is Using Chatbots | Chatbot MagazineBots won‚Äôt replace apps.

Design Thinking: putting people first,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/design-thinking-putting-people-first-8e5c6e61b692,Bethan Phillimore,60,15,3309,"The objective of this article was to critically analyse and reflect on Design Thinking as an organisational resource, emphasising the significance of the empathy phase, while taking ethics into account. I‚Äôll also reflect on my experience of applying Design Thinking to a brief set by CityCo and Manchester Police during the MA Digital Experience Design program at Hyper Island.In its most basic format, Design Thinking is a linear approach to problem-solving using methods perceived previously as exclusively for designers. ‚ÄúDesign Thinking is a human-centred approach to innovation that draws from the designer‚Äôs toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success‚Äù (Brown, 2009, pg. 17). In addition, by emulating the designer, a business can create innovative solutions to challenging problems, usually by teams with varied backgrounds (Moggridge, 2010). Furthermore, Design Thinkers can be traditional designers or those with ‚Äòanalytical‚Äô backgrounds but by using the framework, individuals can unlock their creative confidence (Kelley and Kelley, 2013, pg.4).d.School Stanford, IDEO and the British Design Council are most frequently mentioned as pioneers of the approach. While they all define Design Thinking as a methodology for creative problem solving, IDEO puts the emphasis on the importance of the end-user and therefore creating human-centred products, services, and internal processes (Kelley and Kelley, 2013, pg.21). Although, if done correctly the process can try to capture the mindsets and needs of the target group, assess opportunities based on their needs and find anchor points for designs to start from, forming the perfect balance of desirability, viability and feasibility (IDEO, 2010).At first glance, Design Thinking is easily mistaken for an abstract notion but various frameworks and models offer tangible methods to navigate through the process. The models are designed to be addressed collaboratively within multidisciplinary teams so different models lend themselves better to different groups depending on the level of guidance (Plattner, Meinel and Leifer, 2013). From the many examples, IDEO‚Äôs five phases of the design process (fig. 1), d.School Stanford‚Äôs five hexagons (fig. 2) and the Design Council‚Äôs Double Diamond (fig. 3) are the most established. Nevertheless, while these models offer guidance, one can argue that studying these alone is not enough to understand Design Thinking, as the opportunity for learning Design Thinking happens with the ‚Äòdoing‚Äô (Berk, 2017). Evidently, although the packaging of the different models varies, the steps of empathise, define, ideate, prototype and test remain at the core of them all and therefore, time should not be wasted on deliberating which models but better spent ‚Äòdoing‚Äô the process.While the term Design Thinking has gained more traction and praise over recent years, a controversy around interpretation has become more prevalent. For one, Richard Buchanan argues in ‚ÄòWicked Problems in Design Thinking‚Äô that no single term can adequately cover the broad diversity of ideas and methods it claims to. By giving Design Thinking a name, it is possible to restrict the expanding opportunities of design preventing it from revealing unexpected dimensions in practice (Buchanan, 1992, pg.5). In contrast, to others, the issue lies in that it is just a new name for a complex process that designers have been exercising for years, ultimately, glorifying the design process as a new fad. When Jared M. Spool was asked what Design Thinking was, his response was ‚ÄúProblem solving? Multidisciplinary teams? End-to-end solutions? Delighting users? I‚Äôd been researching and writing about integrating these elements for decades‚Äù (Spool, 2017). Natasha Jen, a partner at Pentagram, supports this view, stating ‚Äúit must be realised that design thinking is nothing new. It‚Äôs a rudimentary problem-solving framework masquerading as a scientific method‚Äù (Jen, 2018). It is worth observing that Spool and Jen are designers and thus one can conclude that designers who are already accustomed with the discover, define, develop and deliver process on their own terms, find the name to be a grossly simplified label for their complicated, creative process they have been doing over the duration of their careers.Potential confusion with the term and understanding the difference between ‚ÄòDesign Thinking‚Äô and ‚Äòdesignerly thinking‚Äô has also been debated. The contrast between ‚Äòwho‚Äô and ‚Äòhow‚Äô design is used in a process, puts the two definitions apart (Johansson-Sk√∂ldberg, Woodilla and √áetinkaya, 2013 pg.123). One can debate that the term Design Thinking, can be used beyond the design context and by people without a design background (Johansson-Sk√∂ldberg, Woodilla and √áetinkaya, 2013, pg. 123). Thus arguing, Design Thinking can be used as a term that does not involve designing. In an interview with Erik Michielsen, Jon Kolko expressed concerns with this use of the term in this context. ‚ÄúMy problem with that approach is that it implies that you can do Design Thinking without doing ‚Äòdesign doing‚Äô‚Äù (Kolko, 2011).From this academic critique of the ethical concerns with using the term Design Thinking, a clear deduction is that the value can become easily lost in the multiple interpretations. Some even claim that Design Thinking is not well understood by anyone, either by the users of it or the public (Kimbell, 2011). Although, Bruce Nussbaum expresses his belief that the ‚Äúconstruction and framing of Design Thinking itself has become a key issue‚Äù (Nussbaum, 2011). By giving the process a name, it invites those who do not truly understand the definition to use it as a throwaway term, thus devaluing the process. The term Design Thinking, therefore, should not be a considered a simplified, universal application to every chaotic design problem. Furthermore, Hillary Collins goes on to state in her paper ‚ÄòCan Design Thinking Still Add Value?‚Äô that the change needs to come as viewing Design Thinking as a paradigm shift instead (Collins, 2013). In conclusion, the term is better used as a mentality which can be personalised and adapted to individual teams and problems within the context, allowing expansion rather than restriction.Not to be confused with sympathy, empathy can be defined as ‚Äúthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another‚Äù (Hornby and Deuter, 2015). Creating empathy for the user is the first step of the Design Thinking process and a critical foundation for the development of products, services and environments (McDonagh and Thomas, 2011). Similarly, Kolko builds on this, saying through empathising with the users, a design-centric organisation encourages their employees to observe and draw insights from their behaviour, to find their wants and needs (Kolko, 2015). What‚Äôs more, only by stepping away from the objective knowledge can we uncover blind spots (Turnali, 2016). In addition, Tim Brown of IDEO goes as far as saying ‚Äúwithout the understanding of what others see, feel, and experience, design is a pointless task‚Äù (Brown, 2008). It can be concluded that the Design Thinking process starts at the point of deeply understanding the needs and wants of the user, only then can they truly design for them and without this input, it could even be said it is a meaningless activity.The business potential for innovation through empathetic, user-focused products and companies cannot be ignored. For instance, when Bank of America undertook a user-centred redesign of its account registration, online-banking traffic increased by 45 percent (Ross, 2014). Additionally, Hasso Plattner believes in the potential of empathy in creating innovative business opportunities. He states by observing people, the opportunity arises to uncover insights, which are vital in creating the innovation solutions businesses strive for (Plattner, n.d.). Although, it is crucial that a company fully adopts an empathetic approach to see results, ‚Äúpretty much all companies insist they focus on the customer. Yet reality often belies that assertion‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù the difference with design-driven companies is that they seek to go far beyond understanding what customers want to truly uncover why they want it‚Äù (Kilia, Sarrazin and Yeon, 2015). Thus, evidencing the necessity for ‚Äòdoing‚Äô in Design Thinking to see tangible results. To see real change in a business, the requirement to put words into action is vital and analysing those actions at a profound level.In conclusion, the evidence of a one-size-fits-all approach to users is severely outdated and a deeper understanding of the user is essential for a highly successful outcome (Dam and Siang, 2018). Dr Prabhjot Singh agrees explaining ‚ÄúWe spend a lot time designing the bridge, but not enough time thinking about the people who are crossing it‚Äù (Singh, 2010). By underestimating the value of empathising, companies could set themselves up for failure, Google Glass being an example of this. In 2013, a ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô product was released but no one bought it. Google failed to empathise with the target user and missed cues on whether the user would use the product (Metz, 2014). Although, in response, Tim Brown argues that he did not view it as a failure, explaining that it is a na√Øve perspective to think the first version would be perfect. Therefore, it could be claimed that the failure of the Google Glass lay in the lack of looping back to the empathy phase within the prototype phase of the Design Thinking process. Concluding that empathy is not just the most important first step in Design Thinking, but the most important step to apply throughout and Design Thinking should not be thought of as a linear process, but an opportunity to revisit previous steps.d.school Stanford identifies the three ways of creating empathy as; observe, engage and watch/listen (d.School Stanford, 2008). Using these steps as guidelines, different techniques can be adopted to suit the user. Secondary research methods can be used, although sparingly to gain the deepest insights into one‚Äôs specific user (IDEO, 2009). For the purpose of this paper and to give context to the second section of the paper, only methods explored within the group project will be discussed. The most widely recognised tool for empathising is person-to-person interviews. Although it can be argued the traditional market research techniques are often unreliable (Evans, 2011). There are pros and cons of different interview formats but in-person interviews give the opportunity for personal intimacy and directness (Mortensen, 2019). In addition, Dinica discusses that they give the opportunity to observe non-verbal communications, which often leads towards deeper insights into what the interviewee is saying (Dinica, 2014). Furthermore, observations as ‚Äòthoughtless acts‚Äô should be noted where possible (Suri, 2005). Within interviews, engaging with extreme users also proves beneficial. Bill Moddridge argues the benefits by saying that only by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the pitfall of designing for yourself (Moggridge, 2007, pg. 726). While Evans also recognises the significant benefits of extreme users, he claims outside experts should conduct the research to accurately identify the unique modes of thinking without bias (Evans, 2011). To sum up, there are many considerations when interviewing and the value does not only lie in verbal communications, but also in the unsaid actions. Once the interviewer has gained ample experience interviewing, they can unlock hidden feelings and insights behind the spoken words, an invaluable tool for empathising.Personas offer the opportunity to organise insights and summarise them as an ideal user. ‚ÄúPersonas help us understand which tasks are truly important and why, leading to an interface that minimises necessary tasks while maximising return‚Äù (Cooper et al., 2014). Furthermore, personas are especially useful for user-facing solutions and allow designers to find the problems in the product from the user‚Äôs perspective (Luchs, Swan and Griffin, 2015). On the other hand, Zakary Kinnaird opposes and argues that personas limit designers by primarily focusing on current user needs, consequently not striving for the opportunity to create new ones (Kinnaird, 2017). Consequently, proving the necessity to base personas on real-life data with newly discovered wants and needs.Outlined are just a few of many tools that can be used to create empathy for a user. Although, assuming a beginner‚Äôs mindset for any of the tools can greatly maximise the desired output of finding more profound insights. By doing this, it makes it easier to leave personal assumptions behind and truly delve into the wants and needs of the user, without bias.When interacting with target users directly with the aim of trying to empathise, ethical considerations must be measured. Some argue it is an ethical duty to meet those with problems, to be able to solve them (Monteiro, 2017). In contrast, Phil Hesketh first suggests considering whether the research has been completed by existing organisations who are working in the research area. By doing so, additional exposure can be avoided (Hesketh, 2016). Once one has decided how and if they will proceed with user interactions, carefully selecting how and where they will be interviewed should be reviewed. As detailed by Lorraine Smith, other points of consideration are diversity within the participant samples, gaining consent and avoiding bias (Smith, 1992). Oberai and Anand resonated with the need to avoid bias too, especially confirmation bias within interviews (Oberai and Anand, 2018). While they believe unconscious bias is unavoidable entirely, it is an important consideration when leading ethical interviews.As part of the ‚ÄòDesign Thinking‚Äô module at Hyper Island, I was given the chance to try, test and review Design Thinking tools and techniques in the context of a challenge set by CityCo and Manchester Police.‚ÄúHow can we design a support tool for a Manchester night out? A night out that helps you consider how to engage with what the city has to offer in a safe and enjoyable way, and what to do if things start to go wrong?‚ÄùComparable to any team working applying Design Thinking in industry, we were split into multidisciplinary groups with different interpretations of Design Thinking. I was the only team member with a formal design background and was familiar with ‚Äòdesignerly thinking‚Äô but not ‚ÄòDesign Thinking‚Äô (Johansson-Sk√∂ldberg, Woodilla and √áetinkaya, 2013). As none of the group were familiar with Design Thinking, we decided to follow Dan Nessler‚Äôs adaptation of the Design Council‚Äôs Double Diamond as we felt it gave the most guidance; particularly needed considering the extent of the brief (Nessler, 2016). While considering ethics, I will examine our journey using the methodology and the tools which influenced our outcome most significantly.Our group chose to target over the 60s and as none of us were part of this age group, creating deep empathy and avoiding assumptions was essential during the discover phase. We could not rely on academic theory alone to understand the wants and needs of the target user (Brown, 2008, pg 33). Therefore, we mainly used a variety of primary research methods while attempting to adopt a beginner‚Äôs mindset to avoid bias.By the end of the discover phase, we insights and observations from twenty-five people. The interviewees were ethically considered and consisted of different; ages, genders, socio-economic backgrounds and marital status. Within the user group, we aimed to discover insights from ‚Äòextreme users‚Äô, in these cases were a 60-year-old and an 85-year-old and by considering these we could hopefully cater for the average. We also decided to interview those who worked with over 60s in Manchester and found fascinating insights. By interviewing a representative from Age-Friendly Manchester we were offered a valuable ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô overview of the target group.We adapted the questions dependent on if we were interviewing those over the 60s or those who worked with the age group and the formats included; in person, over the phone and online questionnaires. We initially used a structured interview format but ‚Äòin-person‚Äô interviews gave opportunities to ask further questions and use the ‚Äò5 Whys‚Äô tool to gain deeper insights, (Ohn, 2006). Unspoken body language was noted where possible. With practice, we learnt to avoid leading questions, although it was more difficult when conducting phone interviews as the need was felt to fill any silences. For ethical reasons, we did not ask for personal information and asked consent to use information that might make the interviewee identifiable. When recording the audio of the conversation, it was essential we asked for consent first and respected the decision of those who denied.A persona was created from summarising the interviews and was carried through the other stages and even demonstrated our solution during the pitch.In conclusion, I found this stage in the process to be vital in getting to the true needs and wants of the user. The insights we uncovered were different from initial assumptions, emphasising the importance of this step. I firmly believe that had we decided not to extensively explore this stage of the design process, our solution would have been useless. One personal observation from this stage was that interviewing is an exceptionally difficult skill to master but with more practice, our insights could have been even more profound.Armed with a wealth of insights and information, we needed to make sense of it all. We used Dan Nessler‚Äôs Double Diamond, along with additional tools from Hyper Island‚Äôs and SessionLabs‚Äô toolboxes to guide us through this phase. One useful tool for finding clarity, was clustering any insights from the interviews to find common ground and identify the most significant. Confirming Kolko‚Äôs belief in the importance of synthesising data, we could find patterns and finished with two overlapping ‚ÄòHow Might We?‚Äô questions (Kolko, 2011), (Design Kit, n.d.). At times, this complicated the process but we felt they were equally important. The most challenging aspect of this stage was resisting the urge to jump forward to thinking about a solution and because of this, we may have rushed this stage to progress to the ideation phase sooner.As we did not have long for this phase we decided to embark on a short ‚Äòsprint‚Äô of ideating. Using our HMW questions, we modified the Crazy 8 tool to generate as many ideas as we could in two rounds of 8 minutes, as we did not feel like one round was enough, finishing with over 30 ideas once we had removed repeats. This tool was excellent for generating a great number of ideas. By clustering the ideas on a ‚ÄòNow, How, Wow‚Äô graph, we could discuss in terms of feasibility, especially important considering our tight deadline (SessionLab, n.d.). Once debated, we completed an ‚ÄòIdea Napkin‚Äô each of a proposed solution (The Straight Up Business Institute, n.d.) This tool worked especially well for turning abstract concepts into tangible ideas prepared for discussion. We concluded a combination of two ideas made the best solution. Again, proving the value of collaboration within Design Thinking.To start the Deliver phase, using storyboards ensured we all understood the solution equally regarding the two main stakeholders. To ‚Äòfail fast‚Äô we wrote up an explanation and immediately started testing it on different target users (Kelley and Kelley, 2013, pg. 39). Feedback through nonverbal communication indicated this method of prototyping was ineffective so a more visually engaging, simplified version was tested for the second round of prototyping.A personal reflection on this phase was that I found it difficult to prototype a ‚Äòservice‚Äô due to its abstract nature. To further develop the prototyping phase of the brief, with more time, I believe a focus group would have been beneficial for receiving more thorough feedback.Today, with increasingly competitive markets and more compound problems stemming from people in a more complex society, Design Thinking offers a structure to guide designers and non-designers, collaboratively through these challenges. This paper demonstrates that while Design Thinking‚Äôs definition lacks clarity, it is still widely praised and embraced. Its human-centred approach, when adopted ethically, can prove hugely beneficial in creating mindful products, services and systems. The empathy stage was critically reviewed using academic and professional resources and then again based on first-hand reflections. As evidenced in a task challenged by CityCo and Manchester Police, it creates a vital starting point to address a problem by finding authentic wants and needs. The client favourably responded to our pitch and praised our ‚Äúexcellent insight into the issues and concerns faced by the older generation and reflects an important issue for the city‚Äù (Swift, 2019). Even with the inherent ethical concerns with creating empathy, Design Thinking offers the unique opportunity to uncover fresh human insights and thus drive innovation into the future.",30/03/2019,1,0,1,2,,,10,0,0,60,167
Top 10 soft skills that a UX leader must possess,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/top-10-soft-skills-thatll-help-you-become-a-ux-leader-50033db75b12,Surya Raveendran Pillai,183,7,1266,"‚ÄúHow do I explain what I do at a party? The short version is that I say I humanize technology.‚Äù ‚Äî Fred BeecherA UX design project is never black or white ‚Äî it comes with a lot of ambiguity and challenges at different phases in the design process. These challenges can only be tackled if a designer has certain soft skills to back one‚Äôs technical knowledge.The good news is, most of these skills can be developed and refined with practice and self-motivation.Here are the top 10 soft-skills that a UX leader must strive towards developing-Design, unlike art, is not just a representation of the designer‚Äôs own self or personal ideas. One cannot just get to work as soon as a brief is provided and then submit the design files once the work is done without any communication in between these phases.A UX Designer has to be vocal right from the beginning ‚ÄìIf you expect it to be a desk job, that doesn‚Äôt require much communication, then I am afraid, that is very far from the reality of what a design process entails.‚ÄúThere are three responses to a piece of design‚Äì yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for.‚Äù ‚Äî Milton GlaserAnd getting to that ‚ÄòWow‚Äô moment takes a considerable amount of time and effort. An innate passion for solving problems is a big plus in the field of UX.You have to be the kind of person that thinks design can change the world. Only that level of enthusiasm will keep you going in the seemingly never-ending Create-Iterate-Test cycles involved in Product design.A UX Designer will have test out multiple solutions to come up with the ‚ÄòWinner‚Äô ‚Äî For example ‚Äî a landing page that gives you high conversions or sales.And that leads us to our next soft skill ‚Äî patience.Patience is a virtue in any field, but in design, even more so!Conducting multiple user tests, tweaking the product, constantly communicating with other teams, awaiting feedback from users until you come up with the perfect solution ‚Äî all need a tremendous amount of patience.You will, at all times, be thinking about ways to make a product better. And that requires constantly analyzing test results, and keeping an open mind about the fact that there is no such thing as a ‚Äòperfect product‚Äô.Even the best of the products in the market need to be repeatedly modified to make them better and relevant to the changing times.The field of User experience is always evolving. New concepts, ideas are always hitting the market. In order to keep up with these changes and incorporating them into your Design process, you need to have a sense of curiosity, and a hunger to keep learning.Only a curious mind can constantly ask insightful questions to stakeholders, and engage in a more in-depth manner with users to understand various problems that crop up in the product design.Product Design can never be a one-man show.It involves collaboration between multiple stakeholders ‚Äî designers, developers, product owners, marketing team and the users. You will have to engage with each one of these stakeholders at various points of the design process.For this, you will have to be a collaborator who engages in respectful, insightful discussions with various teams.Need to code your product a certain way? Talk to the developer. Require feedback on how your product is making life easier for your users? Engage your user through Users tests.And these discussions will happen on a daily basis, during the design process, and one needs to be a collaborator to keep up.A great UX Leader is someone who can adapt to changing times. This involves keeping up with the ever-evolving technology trends, new design tools, changing user behavior and repeated iterations to the product based on analyzing user data.Every Design project brings with it, new challenges. No two design processes can ever be identical.The industry the product is based in, the user demographics, user‚Äôs interests, needs, aspirations and pain points are all factors that affect the design process. The UX designer has to be flexible enough to adapt to these changes.What differentiates a UX Designer from a Marketer or an Artist is that they cannot be added to the left brain or right brain club. It has to be a combination of the two ‚Äî creativity accompanied by rationality.Unlike an artist, a designer cannot only think about self-fulfillment, or unlike a Marketer ‚Äî cannot only make decisions based on numbers. There has to be a middle ground ‚Äî one that involves a lot of ambiguity.This is because UX, at the end of the day, is human-centered ‚Äî and designing for humans cannot be an approach where everything can be predicted beforehand. This requires open-mindedness to try out new ideas and perspectives.This quality is essential for most leadership roles. Assertiveness and standing up for oneself is something everyone could benefit from.With respect to UX Designers, assertiveness becomes all the more important because of the sheer number of people you are dealing with ‚Äî Product owners, development teams, marketers, etc. Imagine the amount of feedback and ideas that will be thrown at you to consider.The UX person is like the advocate of the users and their needs. For a great product to be designed, a Designer has to be heard. And to be heard, they need to have a voice and be assertive.Humility is a highly underrated virtue for a UX Designer.It is very easy to fall in love with the product that you designed. It‚Äôs not always easy to welcome criticism. In such instances, humility is key.Being a human-centered discipline, it is important that a Designer doesn‚Äôt come across as pushy during User tests. Humility makes users more comfortable to open up and point out problem areas in the product design. And this is vital in improving your product.In today‚Äôs times, when the focus is shifting from Intelligent quotient(IQ) to Emotional quotient (EQ) of digital products, empathy has become a key skill for a UX designer, up there on the list with technical skills.To create a product that makes the life of your user easier, you need to first, step into their shoes and think and feel like them.Simply put, empathy allows a designer to understand target users better. And that is the foundation upon which your the design process should be based on.Here is a bonus skill that is a personal favorite ‚Äì‚ÄúEvery great design begins with an even better story.‚Äù ‚Äî Lorinda MamoGreat User experiences tell great stories. It is an essential part of the design process ‚Äî especially at the stage when you are creating User personas. The more detailed these character sketches and their back-stories are, the better.Detailed narratives provide that much needed human touch to an otherwise technology-driven field.Stories help document the needs, motivations and key pain-points or potential design flaws, and make you better equipped to design a solution keeping users at the center of the design process.The key to being an effective UX Designer is not only about how skilled you are at Adobe XD, Balsamic or¬†Sketch.It‚Äôs about how you interact with various stakeholders, how involved and keen you are at trying out new ideas and concepts, how you react to feedback and how much of a human touch you can bring to an otherwise technical product design process.These qualities will be instrumental in defining your position as a UX Leader among a multitude of designers crowding the market.As designers, can you think of any other soft-skills that have been instrumental in your growth?

Designers must have a seat at technical meetings,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/designers-must-have-a-seat-at-technology-meetings-8a79f83e51cd,rasterfield,256,3,609,"I joined the team as a UX designer last year. The team consists of the product manager, technical business analysts, and developers. For them, my role is making the product interface prettier and I am also assisting with user acceptance testings. So the tasks I add to the backlogs are ‚Äúdo it when we have time‚Äù which we never have. I am here for proactively preventing bad experiences for customers.The team has been chased by fixing technical issues every day so that they have forgotten about the customers. Dealing with reported defects are clearer for them to see in the burn-down charts, than spending time thinking about proactively improve customers pain points.To show what I can help with for them to make better products, I have a couple of experiences that show designers must have a seat at a technology meeting with developers, at an early stage as possible.The good experience is that when we started a new project. The team lead always invited me to the meetings with the client, legal, and technical discussions. I could understand the overview of the status and what needed to be done by me, and others if not entirely but could predict what was coming. More importantly, the context and why the way we do and how we plan the project. Carefully listening to the conversations at the meeting, I could offer design suggestions proactively before PM or BA asked me to do so because I understood the context and could anticipate what they would want to see.The other experience is how I was working with the BA‚Äôs direction. I wasn‚Äôt at any of the meetings, and I never asked to be in them. This project had gone for more than a few months. My part was done, so it became a past project for me. Four weeks ago, the project came back to me to rework. The project was still going on, and somehow I had to rework everything from the beginning.This time I have been invited to all the meetings so that I understand what and why we are doing, starting from grasping the circumstances. I now can think of HOW I can provide my design. I learnt this is what happens when designers are not included and not involved with the people and the project.Designers, who work closely with developers, need a seat at the meetings to understand the high level of technology and how the data is displaying on your interface and how our customer interacts with them.If you are working in a strong technology team, I recommend that you participate in as many meeting and discussion with them as possible, even if the design work is not immediately relevant. You could ask questions after the meeting or when they are at the kitchen making tea.Your digital product won‚Äôt go well when a designer only sends her ‚Äúpretty designs‚Äù and telling developers that the descriptions for interaction and CSS codes within the Invision. Conversely, if you ask a designer to design something without informing them of any background, it‚Äôs never going to get done, or the designer sends you quite the opposite of what you expected.We work together for our customers. Designers provide good experiences to the product considering how the systems work. Designers‚Äô imagination and aspiration about the products are limitless, but technologies, time, and money, people (resources) are limited. As a designer, these constraints are healthy and happy to challenge them.Extra ===My friend asked, ‚Äúhey, how is your project going?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mess and chaos.‚ÄùShe said, ‚Äúevery project is a mess and chaos.

The Best Ways To Get More Clients For Your Social Media Marketing Agency (SMMA) Today,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-best-ways-to-get-more-clients-for-your-social-media-marketing-agency-smma-today-627167ee42a5,[arlie] PEYTON,3000,14,2982,"When it comes to creating a profitable SMMA, sales is your most important asset.Sure, that can be said about any business.However, as I watch hundreds of people come and go in the SMMA industry, I‚Äôm noticing the biggest pattern for failed agencies: the lack of sales.More specifically, the lack of going out and getting them.If you search for a term like ‚Äúonline business‚Äù in Youtube or Facebook, you‚Äôre likely to get an ad for SMMA. Visitors are sold all the hype about how they can make endless profits from owning an SMMA.Like any online business, it‚Äôs just not that easy.Many people don‚Äôt understand how to get more clients, let alone their first.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, with most SMMA courses the sales training is provided. You can even go online and watch free videos on how to do all of that.But the unseen truth about starting an SMMA is for the first part of it, it‚Äôs mostly just sales. Before you plop down a few hundred (or thousand) dollars on a course about SMMA, let me show the sales process.If you can get sales, you have a chance at making great money with an SMMA. If you think you‚Äôll struggle with sales, you‚Äôre doomed from the beginning. It‚Äôs something that can be learned, but real salespeople are a special breed as well.Before we get into the sales part, let me unpack the SMMA operating model.Like any marketing agency, an SMMA is composed of specialists. You need at least one person who is an expert at creating effective social media ads and content. In many cases, Instagram and Facebook is the focus because of the potential reach and ROI.It‚Äôs not rocket science to navigate the Facebook dashboard or to create a good ad. However, since policies, rules, and strategies constantly change an expert on the subject is often needed. Campaigns and accounts get shut down all the time, so working with someone very familiar with the landscape is imperative. In my agency, I never hire anyone with less than $150,000 in ad spend experience.And that‚Äôs the kicker.A lot outside the SMMA think that the business owner is the ad expert: they‚Äôre not. Most of what I see are owners who understand social media well, but hire experts (on Upwork or a similar website) as subcontractors to do the technical work. It‚Äôs like a restaurant. The owner is not always the chef. In many cases, SMMA owners also act as the social media expert to cut costs. However, running an SMMA and deploying multiple campaigns for clients can get complicated.So what‚Äôs an owner to do?If they hire a subcontractor to place and optimize ads, an owner‚Äôs role is simple: get sales. That‚Äôs it. Technically, onboarding clients would be another major task but that can be automated with a video and an online form.I came to this conclusion early in my journey with SMMA. I had it all wrong. I focused on the mechanical aspects of mastering Facebook ads, but none of that really mattered if I had no one to create ads for. And to be honest, no one is good at getting fantastic results when they‚Äôre just starting out.That‚Äôs when it hit me.I felt like a poser. How could I go on about getting awesome results for potential clients when all I had was a couple of weak case studies I created with my friends? Business owners would be forking over $2,000 a month, and for what? An amateur cutting his teeth on paid ads? That did not hold a lot integrity for me, but unfortunately it‚Äôs a pretty common situation in this industry.That wasn‚Äôt for me.I decided to stop learning Facebook Ads and hire a real expert. I interviewed a lot of top-notch social media experts for paid ads and found a couple real pros with enterprise-level experience. I paid them nearly half of the retainer (minus client ad spend costs). It was more like a business partnership until I learned how the finances really worked in an SMMA. (It‚Äôs about a 70/30 split plus performance bonuses now.)After the first few clients, I thought things were going pretty well. Clients would get at least 1,000% ROAS and plenty of new business. But what they don‚Äôt tell you is that clients don‚Äôt always stay for the retainer you prescribed (usually 3‚Äì6 months with an incentive/discount to stay on).If you lose a couple clients, it‚Äôs a huge hit on your revenue. Therefore, the agency owner‚Äôs job is to keep new clients coming in. You can always hire more ad specialists if need be.That brings us to the hardest part of running an SMMA. It‚Äôs where I see dozens of would-be owners lose interest and give up the business entirely. This happens daily. Here are the three patterns of SMMA failure:1.FEAR OF FAILURE AND REJECTION ‚Äî No one likes to hear no‚Äôs all day. You must build thick skin to compete in sales and some people just don‚Äôt have it. In the beginning, you‚Äôre calling on 50‚Äì100 people a day to get a presentation appointment. The best strategy is to never sell your service on the phone, but talk up potential sales results for the client based on your custom research. All the selling, data, and proof-of-concept happens in a lengthier face-to-face meeting. Because of this, prospecting calls only last a minute or two. Even so, every rejection adds up and it‚Äôs defeating.2.LACK OF PROPER SALES TRAINING ‚Äî Resources on how to sell are a dime a dozen. A lot of them are pure regurgitated hype. However, there are some sales training gems out there that are worth paying for. The truth is that sales are in the realm of psychology and communication. Both of those topics are not exactly scientific, though they try to be. In reality, it‚Äôs messy and speculative at best. However, refining scripts, body language, and responses have proven to be valuable to increase sales.3.SMMA IS A POOR BUSINESS-FOUNDER FIT ‚Äî Some people are natural introverts. While some introverts do quite well in this industry, a lot don‚Äôt because there are constant interactions with complete strangers. You have to serve your client, reach out to hundreds of people every week, and give talks on building businesses with social media ads. This is the job. If you‚Äôre an introvert that can‚Äôt ‚Äúturn it on‚Äù when you need to, this is not the right business for you. Furthermore, some people just find that running an agency isn‚Äôt what they thought it was. The business-owner fit is completely off and perhaps another field would be a win-win.So how do you get over all of these obstacles to getting sales?There are a few solutions that have helped SMMA owners handle sales. Here are three actions great salespersons do to get more SMMA clients:First, they commit to reaching out every day (preferably by phone). If you called at least 50 people every day for a month purely for the experience with talking to strangers, you‚Äôre guaranteed to get better at your people skills. That is assuming you adjust your conversations based on feedback.I‚Äôm talking about using a little bit of The Scientific Method here.There are lots of things to recalibrate when you do sales and seeing the whole process more scientifically will definitely improve it.Second, let others do some heavy lifting for you. I wrote about this in another article, but it‚Äôs a common tactic for the most advanced salespeople. They use their existing network to send them pre-qualified prospects.Here is a short list of networks most people have at their disposal: Friends and Family, Former Co-Workers, Email Lists, Former Classmates (alumni), LinkedIn Contacts, Facebook Contacts, etc.If your lists are full of mostly weak connections, leverage the network lists of close friends and family.It‚Äôs easy to spruce up your lists.You simply meet up with people you know, like, and trust. You learn what they‚Äôre up to lately, and you get a good handle on what their ideal client looks like. Then you do the same for your business. Lastly, you send each other potential clients. Over-deliver on your quid pro quo. (A good book about all of this is by professor Adam Grant: Give And Take: Why Driving Others Drives Our Success).The key here is to have your contact call the potential client before you call. This is called a ‚Äúfavorable introduction‚Äù. They can briefly talk you up and let others know you‚Äôve done business with them. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work out, but it‚Äôs worth a try.Me, I don‚Äôt like to get emails or calls that are unsolicited. I‚Äôve seen the failed business hook-up scheme far too many times to count, and this is what goes through my head each time:Gee Bob, thank you for connecting me to this complete stranger in an awkward way that clearly points to a form of cross-promotional marketing. You‚Äôre disinvited to next week‚Äôs BBQ!However, if someone I trust really understands my business and deep down they truly believe some stranger can add value to it, I‚Äôm happy to give them a minute or five on the phone.This is the way empires, past and present, have been built.We only buy from whom we know, like, or trust ‚Äî unless we desperately need something. A favorable introduction tactic is like standing outside in the long sinuous line at Club Business. You‚Äôre at the very end of it. After waiting, you bump into someone who knows and likes you. You get to talking and they realize you should meet the club owner because of your shared interests. From there, your friend walks you right up to the front of the line, tells the bouncer ‚Äúhe‚Äôs with me‚Äù, and suddenly the red velvet rope is unlatched for you to walk through. Next thing you know, you‚Äôre being introduced to the club owner.It works, so work your network!Third, get a sales coach or mentor. Learn from the best and someone who has done what you want to do.Model success: it‚Äôs that simple.If they‚Äôve been where you‚Äôre at, it‚Äôs likely they know all the common ways to fail at selling in your field. They also know a lot of ways to succeed. Why waste your time and money trying to figure it out for yourself? If SMMA sales training is not a big part of your current program, get more training elsewhere. Remember, at the end of the day sales is a vital activity. No sales, no profit.The catch is, a lot of sales advice is misguided and unethical.I have a strong and unpopular opinion on a few sales gurus that seem to get all the attention. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt think their tactics work. Again, we‚Äôre talking psychology and communication here, the weakest sciences of all. Something is bound to work.What I look for in sales training are the three E‚Äôs. Training needs to be Effective, Efficient, and Ethical. Bottom line, the sales system must actually get sales (effective). Parts of this sales system and training must be scalable and automated to free up my time and energy (efficient). It‚Äôs the last ‚ÄúE‚Äù that is usually questionable. A lot of sales advice is too slick for me (ethics).So where should you go to get sales training for your SMMA?Learn from whomever you are comfortable with. If that‚Äôs Belfort or Cardone, go for it. My picks are the less flamboyant types like Zig Zigler, Jeffrey Gitomer, and Oren Klaff. But to each their own.As you learn more about sales, focus on the general principles and verify that it aligns with your company values and goals. All the details will be ironed out by putting in the long hours practicing it in the field.That can take a long time to master, but the good news is that the pains of SMMA sales are quickly being addressed. One key to SMMA sales is to hone in on specific platforms and niche strategists with proven results for what they do.For example, to get to decision-makers it makes sense to utilize LinkedIn. Recently, I came across a company that passes my 3 E‚Äôs test called (SurgeFlowDigital owned by Natasha Vilaseca ‚Äî no affiliation). This company has done-for-you lead generation services and training on how to systematically acquire SMMA clients from LinkedIn. Since getting clients is difficult, this is a great solution.To get the edge, I would look at the way you qualify your leads. A lot of time and money is spent on calling prospects that are in no position to qualify for your services. I have coached SMMAs to set up 5‚Äì10 criteria for their ideal client. Those items are put on a spreadsheet. You can hire cheap labor on Upwork or Fiverr to do this task. It‚Äôs called Lead Sourcing. Build a quality list of businesses to call by pre-qualifying them first.For example, here are a few things I look for. A good client must be bringing in at least $20,000 a month. In my town, there are several lists and reports that make his information available to all (The Book of Business Lists). They must also be within 15 miles from where my business is located so only focus on a few local cities in my region. Their website must not have a Facebook pixel (use Chrome‚Äôs extension called FB Pixel Helper and turn off any ad blockers).Other good signs are that they don‚Äôt have recent ads on their business Facebook Page. If they don‚Äôt have a page, but they‚Äôre a big business it‚Äôs actually a selling point for your services. Often I look at Instagram to evaluate their follower count and engagement, especially if they have visual services or products (gyms, homes, retail goods, etc). Low activity on Instagram could be a golden opportunity to discuss with them.Every criterion takes you a step closer to finding a high-quality lead. Guesstimating the average sale is a good criterion. You want that figure to be over $100, but ideally north of $500. If they‚Äôre already advertising on traditional media, this is a great sign. In my mind, they‚Äôve wasted a lot of money on print ads or television and that kind of marketing is hard to track. Moreover, on Facebook they‚Äôll simply get more exposure to their ideal and highly-targeted market. I like to take a look at their Google Business page and/or Yelp page see if there are only a few reviews. That‚Äôs a good indicator they might need social media marketing help too.There are many more things to look for when creating a good lead sourcing list. However, the list of things I look for above is a start. In addition, many SMMA owners have discovered that even though leads meet their basic criteria they still have to go one step further.I first discovered a problem with basic online sales funnels when I had a luxury real estate client. My client‚Äôs task was to pre-lease fancy units from buildings that weren‚Äôt even finished. I learned that they spent a lot of marketing dollars to acquire new tenants (CoCA): $3,500 per sale. That seemed like a lot, but their year-long leases were worth over $80,000 a year per unit.The client‚Äôs goal was to get enough interested parties to go through the sales funnel and come out signing contracts. That was easier said than done. That‚Äôs when I learned that even within the funnel there were pre-qualifying features and segments that would determine the best kinds of buyers from the tire-kickers.From this point onward, I started to implement the idea of Lead Scoring into my high-end clients and my own agency. Sadly, this was a new term to me a few years ago. Lead Scoring is when you evaluate the best leads based on select criteria, urgency, and trust. For example:All of these things add up and become prioritized in your lead scoring system. This is why my real estate client spent so much money on acquiring customers. They didn‚Äôt want a basic list generated from placing a few targeted video ads on Facebook. They needed more commitment and engagement to land customers.This process was like throwing a whole new dimension on to my basic funnel and lead sourcing activities. The payoff of lead scoring is that what you end up with the Glengarry leads. Leads that score the highest are truly the best and have the greatest probability of doing business with you.If you get lots of leads that don‚Äôt go anywhere and you sell high-ticket items, you need lead scoring. It takes more time and money, but this is another task that can be outsourced and automated with lead scoring software. When you get a budget for it, implement it immediately.All this heavy sales stuff might sound daunting to new SMMA owners. It does get easier and more interesting. As you build up your case studies and client base, you‚Äôll take on different roles.In the beginning, 80% of your time should be doing some sort of direct sales activity.However, when your agency is cruising along practically on auto-pilot because you have more help, the percentage of time flips. Now you spend 80% of the time improving business systems and only 20% doing pure sales.I‚Äôm lucky to have survived the pains of early SMMA growth. I have certainly learned a lot and failed a lot of times. But today, a big part of business development is simply collecting referrals from previously satisfied clients.

Turning quality interview into numbers,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/turning-quality-interview-into-numbers-c184946d1bdc,Anna Mizina,35,3,526,"Interviewing at early empathy stage is mostly about insight searching. However, when it is prepared research it‚Äôs not about random questions to the potential user. It‚Äôs about hypothesis validation.1. what is your hypothesis?2. how will you approve or disapprove it?Mostly we do not measure interviews in numbers as they are considered to be more quality research than quantitate. We just work with quotes we heard from a user, and get the answer to assumptions in ‚Äúyes‚Äù, ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúyes, but ‚Ä¶‚Äù formats.In order to take more from that information and to dive deeper into analysis, it‚Äôs required to transform data into the numbers. What it gives:1. it‚Äôs the way to estimate interview, measure whether it was successful or not, whether you can use that data at all and accept it as true. At this point it is important to remember: unsuccessful interviews are valuable too because they give you the chance to failure earlier.2. Gain the understanding of whether the problem exists at all, not in researcher ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù way, but by a specific score.3. Another way to analyze the research result and find new insights. For example, you can compare the score of different parameters and see new things.I offer two main ways to make it.A. Give your customers a few questions, where they can give you numbers.Remember, how the product-market fit is measured?When you asking user about his problem and receive an answer, ask him to make a score ‚Äúhow important is that problem from 0 to 10?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow much does this specific problem bother you?‚Äù It can give you information whether he is lying about the existence of the problem. But also, an opportunity to have quantifiable data.B. This type of measuring was proposed in almost classic book Lean Analytics by A.Croll & B.Yoskovitz.After completing each interview, ask yourself the following questions.You have to raise at least 31 points per interview to take it‚Äôs as successful research.The original idea is mostly about the decent indication of whether you‚Äôre onto something or not with the problems you want to solve. You should adopt those questions to your research goals and main product assumptions.Those two described ideas are just the basic ways to modeling score system. It has to be a part of preparing the research at the same stage as your formulating hypothesis, make a question list and respondent —Åhoice —Åriterias1. compare the score of different interviews. It could help with customer development on the next steps and choose the priority among TA segments.2. interview has to have minimum score level. That‚Äôs how you can understand if the information is useful, can it be taken as the proof or disproof of a hypothesis.As an example, if you have a few interviews which look like the proof of your hypotheses, you should check the score of all the interviews. What if only one of them has a high-quality level and it has the opposite result?Clearly, interviews are quality researches first of all. The main point of this paper is not even about turning everything into numbers, but more about the deeper analysis of this information, comparing it and making the priorities easily.Get more from your researches!",30/03/2019,0,0,7,0,1050,560,3,0,0,2,311
3 routines that made me a better UX designer,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/3-routines-that-made-me-a-better-ux-designer-185f314b9037,Micha Wiebe Kafka,9,5,886,"In our job as UX Designers we‚Äôre honored to improve and enrich the lives of millions on a daily basis. We work where beautiful design and the users reality meet ‚Äî and we balance these with business-inherit necessities.I‚Äôd like to share with you three routines to become a better UX Designer, you can start with apply today. These tips (or hacks if you like) helped me to become a better UX Designer for me, my team and the whole organization.To follow the newest trends in tech or design has become impossible. Even in a 25-hour day you couldn‚Äôt keep up with all the interesting articles, podcasts or talks on conferences around the world.But UX Designers are often asked to envision the next big thing on a daily basis. So how can you stay on top of things but still get your job done?The solution I found was a self-made tool, that helps to organize the mess. It works automatically, is highly customizable, does categorization and everything is fully searchable.PLUS: Everybody on your team can contribute and use it as a knowledge base with minimum effort.First, I started to use Evernote as a database to collect all information: from talks, screenshots to internal reportings and blog posts.The handy tool IFTTT.com helped me to connect the Evernote and automatically create notes, whenever a defined event happens.Let‚Äôs say you want to keep up with publications, blogs and news. Just add the RSS Feed to IFTTT and create a new note for every new item. This way you can also track reviews on the App Store or on a review platform like Trusted Shops.Reporting tools like Google Analytics support automatic reports. I just forwarded them to my Gmail, connect it with IFTTT and automatically create a new note. Or your user research expose that comes as a PDF? It‚Äôs all searchable due to the built-in OCR that also searches images.Now, I turn to this database of knowledge whenever I have a question. My boss asks me to redesign the Burger Menu? First thing I do is search the database for ‚ÄúBurger Menu‚Äù and I‚Äôll get trends, reportings and all the contextual information I need to start designing.Not only with news and trends it‚Äôs easy to lose the overview. Companies with many employees make it just as easy.This no sole problem for me as a designer, but also to other teams that work collaboratively.Over the last years in design I learned that you need to explain UX Design a lot and advertise for it in your company.As designers we shouldn‚Äôt be too shy about our profession. I believe that we contribute a lot to the entrepreneurial vision, so let‚Äôs talk about it.For example you could establish a routine presentation of just 30 minutes for new employees. Especially in fast-growing companies you‚Äôll get a lot of interested listeners.On a 3-monthly routine I get the chance to answer questions like: ‚ÄúWhat the hack is UX?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow can we work together?‚Äù.I can also recommend internal newsletters about your work, posters in the hallways or internal research to get more visibility.What do I get from it? One important effect is, that this lets other teams know you‚Äôre there. No matter if they find usability bugs or are able to contribute buckets of data that inform our design decisions..The other is that you connect with other teams and start to relate to the companies vision. For me that‚Äôs is crucial to good design.Me for example found great colleagues that are curious about UX in many teams, mostly unexpected. Our social media team, buying department , customer service agents or the SEO-teammates now help me to build better products.It sounds so simple but I always tend to forget that I‚Äôm the designer ‚Äî not the user. But our brains lets us identify so much with our work, that we start to believe our needs are the users needs.So I turned to quantitative research and data analysis but that doesn‚Äôt help either. It actually makes my problem worse: I start to project myself and my prejudices into bare data.It was a while until I realized that empathy with your users doesn‚Äôt start with personas. UX is design for humans, not idealized imaginations.I needed to see the human behind the data, when it was almost invisible.My solution was to put up photos of the people that I interviewed when doing qualitative research. Now in our UX office you‚Äôll see friendly faces and names of real people and they get more and more.Also we hung up important KPIs about engagement and devices. I need to understand what a users day would be like. Imagine stories, where your product is involved, that don‚Äôt reflect the streamlined, idealized vision.Just never forget that there‚Äôs a human being on the other end of the interface.I personally got a lot from establishing these routines. My job is to balance between design, business and user needs.TL;DRHave fun at what you‚Äôre building. User experience is so much about making great products that make the world a better place.Enjoyed the story?

Why are you carrying all that baggage?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-are-you-carrying-all-that-baggage-bbdae7d1a3a9,Heath Evans,1300,3,529,"Every time we prepare to board a plane we are faced with a dilemma? What do we need to pack?It requires intentionality because there‚Äôs a scarcity of space, so we can only take those things that are going to help us on our journey.For some it means filling our bags to the brim, for others it‚Äôs about leaving plenty of room for those treasures and trinkets we might pick up along the way.For all of us, the mindset is simple. Only pack what we need, because anything extra adds to the burden and will come at a cost.As I considered this I realised what a powerful metaphor this is for our lives. I wondered what would change if we took this intentional approach to the baggage we carry with us every day.So I ask you:Is it you?If it is, why do we so often carry that burden of a mistake we made in the past, or hold onto that grudge, that jealousy, that tension which has consumed us for so long.How have these items ever helped us, or is it simply that they have been with us for so long that we no longer considered the possibility that we can let them go and create space for something new?The shame of a failed venture, a broken relationship, a misguided mistake, a fear that you‚Äôre not ready? How long do we need to hold onto these and how do they impact the posture we take into day?So often it is others trying to force us to carry these burdens, because they‚Äôve been unable to leave these behind themselves and want us to experience their struggle.But how does this help either of us progress when neither of us are now able to help the other lighten their load?We are filled with a world where success feels so fleeting, and failure feels forever, and are surrounded by a society determined to ensure we never leave these tags behind.But what if we did?What if instead of holding onto past successes, desperate to ensure we didn‚Äôt lose them and others didn‚Äôt forget them, if instead we focused on how we can lift others up, lightening their load without fear of reciprocity, so that together we can achieve more.Conversely, what if we saw someone struggling, crippled by the weight of shame or stress and gave them permission to leave that behind and stand tall, because the world awaits their wonder. What if that person was us, how would that change how we approached tomorrow?Stop letting someone else determine what baggage you carry. Negative baggage is a burden, and those telling you to carry it only want to hold you down and hold you back.What you‚Äôll discover is a world of possibilities. A world full of treasures and trinkets, that can only be discovered when we can create the space to love, learn, and help others.When we are intentional about creating this room, we discover how truly powerful these experiences can be, and how important they are for us to bring on this incredible journey.So the question I leave you with.This is dedicated to my great friend Jordyn. Thankyou for inspiring me to write this piece.",30/03/2019,4,0,5,4,1050,268,3,0,0,5,451
Why Going To College Was A Mistake,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-going-to-college-was-a-mistake-d869ddbd5a8d,Stephen Hall,236,11,2582,"I grew up below the poverty line. To us as kids, McDonald's was a 5-star restaurant. Because of that, I developed an entrepreneurial mindset very early. Always looking for a new way to make money so that we could pay the bills and have food on the table. One of my very first ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù was in kindergarten. On the way to school, there was a Hostess and they would throw away tons and tons of snacks and treats that were about a month to expire. So, I would snag a bunch, fill my backpack full every day and sell them to the kids on the playground for 25 cents each. This would give me enough money to help put food on the table and sometimes buy a new toy here and there!My Dad was nowhere to be found, and my mother did the best she could as a high school dropout and single mother. Everyone one in my immediate family was a dropout. As a kid, when asked what do you want to be when you grow up, I would always reply with ‚ÄúA Scientist‚Äù or ‚ÄúAn Inventor‚Äù. To me, the inventors and scientists of the world were my rock stars. I would watch Bill Nye the Science Guy religiously. I knew that that was what I wanted to do when I grew up. My family would tell me that I‚Äôm living in a fantasy world, that I should give up on my dreams and get a real job like the rest of us.But getting a ‚ÄúReal Job‚Äù like them would mean continuing to struggle to get by. Seeing how hard it was for everyone, I knew that I had to be different. And believe what I had been told all my life, that college was the way to a better life, I knew that that is where I needed to be. So, I studied every day and learned everything I could.The day that I turned 16, the age in my state where you can legally take the GED test, I dropped out of high school, signed up for all 5 GED tests, passed them all and enrolled for my first semester of college!Kinda a Birthday present to myself. I had decided that I would go for a degree in Psychology. I was already the therapist for my group of friends and it seemed fitting.Not very long into my first year, I was kicked out of my place and became homeless. Around that same time, I also found out that a degree in Psychology was #4 on the nations most unemployable degrees. I looked for work and odd jobs here and there to no avail.Finally, after not eating for about 3 days, I sucked up my pride and asked for help. I went to try to get food stamps and see if the state could help me find a job. Their reply to me was sorry about your situation, but as long as you are in college we can not provide you with any help. If we helped you we would have to help out every college student in the nation‚Ä¶So, homeless, hungry, and out of options, I dropped out. Got some food stamps and spent all day every day looking for a new job and new place to live. After about a month, I found a place willing to hire me without a permanent address and a place to live willing to let me rent with an agreement of paying the first and lasts months rent and deposit when I could.I moved upstate and took a job in a furniture factory. Within 9 months I was promoted to manager of the factory. A while letter my boss sent me to do a desktop support specialist certification. You know so that I could do more work for the same pay. The classes were set up in a lab-based environment and all the work for the semester was available to form the start.By this time I had grown pretty jaded and complacent believing that I would end up like the rest of my family. This gave me a smartass attitude and I would only put out the least about of effort.When classes started, I half-assed all my work and rushed through my work finishing all of it in the first 3 weeks. I spent the rest of the semester playing around on the computer and helping out other students.In the second semester, my instructor came up to me and said: ‚ÄúYou are really good at this. You finish all your work early and have a straight 4.0 in all of your classes.‚Äù I looked him in his eyes and replied: ‚ÄúReally? Because I‚Äôm Totally half-assing this. Just think what I could do if I tried or cared.‚Äù and returned to my video game. He got a big smile on his face and said: ‚ÄúYou everything about doing Computer Science?‚Äù I told him: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you just said to me.‚Äù His reply set me on a path that changed my life forever. He said: ‚ÄúYou like videos games right?‚Äù I replied: ‚ÄúYeah, they're all right.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúWant to make one?‚Äù This piqued my interest. I had always wanted to make a video game so I agreed.Little did I know, but my instructor was actually a Computer Scientist. Not just a help desk instructor. He taught me all the fundamentals of computer science, basic practices of engineering, how to design and architect software and three months later, I had taught myself calculus in order to make a neural network, made a clone of old school Zelda and put the neural network into the game so that the enemies would change their attack patterns based on how you play!After that, He offered me a job working for him helping with his classes and research. I immediately quit my job and went to work for him while pursuing a degree in computer science!And this is where the fun began‚Ä¶After a few years, my instructor quit to go and work in the industry. I kept my job for a few months working for the new instructor before I quit and moved back down to the Portland OR area. I went over to WSU to try to enroll in the university, they told me that I needed to have calculus on my transcript to be admitted. Even though I had taught it to myself and could pass the placement test. So I went to the nearby community college where I had started my journey so many years ago. They told me that because I was there so many years ago and was enrolled in a lower math class back then, that is was school policy that I had to start back at that class‚Ä¶ And as an added bonus, all of my previous credits and classes I had taken over the last 3 years do not count and that I would have to start back as a freshman. Lovely‚Ä¶.So, I spent the next 3 semester at the community college taking a bunch of prerequisites for my bachelors and working towards getting into WSU. Now I am almost 4 years into college and have had to restart twice. Not only that, but I'm leading a study group at the college where I‚Äôm tutoring students and helping them with there homework in classes that I‚Äôm not allowed to take?I finally get into WSU. I came with a letter of recommendation from my previous instructor, and 3 letters of recommendation from instructors at the community college that I have never taken a class from for all the work and help I did in the study group.I get to my initial interview with the head of the computer science department, Dr. Lang. He asks me about my experiences and previous classes. And to my surprise, he tells me that not only is he going to deny all the credits from my previous school, but that the college I just transferred from has a direct transfer agreement for those completing their Associate's degree, and I did not complete the degree so none of my credits are directly transferable. Meaning that I now have to restart my degree for a 3 time as a freshman‚Ä¶. His reason for denying the 3 years at my other school ‚ÄúWell we use Java here and all of your classes were done in C++, So you are going to have to get a better foundation in Java before I can let you proceed.‚Äù My reply to that was ‚ÄúSeriously, isn‚Äôt the study of computer science supposed to be language independent? That all the skills you learn are transferable no matter the language? And the fact that I already know 5 programming languages and am working full time running my own freelancing business and worked for my previous college for almost 3 years actually making software real software that is still in use means that I already have a pretty good foundation in computer science? That I can learn the basics of Java in about a weekend because all the languages I already know are C-based languages just like Java?‚Äù. He simply replied with, well you need to know Java here so my decision stands.So still determined to actually finish my degree finally, I said screw it and carried on. I slept through all my classes, never went to any of the labs, and for most of the first two years, about 80% of the work turned in by the whole class was my code. I took a bunch of extra classes on the side to fill in the gaps and boredom, waiting until I could actually learn something new.My favorite part is in all of Dr. Langs classes. I would turn in the assignments the day they were assigned. The day before or day of, most of the students would come to me and beg me for my code so that they could turn in my assignments. They would reformat it and make it look a bit different, But the line for line, they would turn in the exact code that I had turned in days ago. Dr. Lang would give them 100% on their assignment (of my code) and find some stupid reason to mark me down on my assignments. Never enough to take away my 4.0 average, but definitely aggravating in the least. I assume it had a lot to do with the fact that I would sit in the front row and sleep through all of his lectures. My way of letting him know, that I‚Äôve already done all of this before and know what I‚Äôm doing.I continued to go to the community college in the summer to take other classes that were much cheaper there and get some extra certifications. After about 3.5 years at WSU, and I now have the equivalent of 279 university credits. I‚Äôm about 6 classes away from a degree in Psychology and a degree in Mathematics, two semesters away from completing my bachelors of science in Computer Science, tutoring people in masters level classes for computer science, again in classes I‚Äôm not allowed to take, and have the first two years of mechanical and electrical engineering completed as well. And I have a certification in personal training and group fitness instructing.This was because like I mentioned before, I would take classes at the community college during the summer and at WSU the cost of 12 credit hours and up was the same, up to 24 credit hours. So I took full advantage of that. One trimester, my advisor was trying to make me take a history class, but I did not like the instructor and wanted to wait until someone else was teaching it. She told me that if there was a time in my schedule where that class could fit in, then she was going to make me take it. So, I enrolled in 9 Math classes and filled every time slot that those classes were offered. And I passed everyone with a 4.0. She didn‚Äôt think that was as amusing as I did though.Then I get a call from Financial Aid. Because they had made me restart my degree so many times I have reached the maximum amount of time that I can receive Financial aid. And that I was not even supposed to get it this trimester and due to an error in the accounting department, I had to pay out about $35,000 in the next few weeks to continue my classes‚Ä¶ There was no way I could do that. I didn‚Äôt have that kind of money. And my freelancing wasn‚Äôt making anywhere near enough to pay for that.I applied for loans, looked for more work, anything I could do to try to get the money. I was so close for the 3rd time. Almost done with not 1 but 3 degrees. And now this?Long story short, I was not able to get their money in time and was forced to drop out once again. But, feeling confident in my skills and abilities, I went around and applied for every developer job in my area. After about 4 months of getting tons and tons of people telling me they only hire people with degrees, I said screw it and decided to start a real business, not just small time freelancing. If they didn‚Äôt want to hire me, I would be their competition. So I did, And it well, I ended up doing almost $3mm my first year in business, but since it was my first business my costs were way too high. there‚Äôs a big difference between working out of your garage and paying for an office and employees.I eventually got a handle on it and a few years later. But, I can honestly say after 12 years in the industry, the only things I learned in college that were even Remotely useful, was Data Structures in my first year. Everything else that I learned in college, I have pretty much never used after college. I personally believe that it was all a huge waste of time and money. And If I had just Started my company earlier, I would be in the same place I am now.Today, even with all of my years of experience, All the work I‚Äôve done and continue to do, I still find it easier to start a new business from scratch than to get a new job in my area without a degree. I‚Äôve literally had more than one company tell me that even though I was the most qualified applicant that applied, this other guy has a degree and I do not. And here I am not almost $100k in debt. Almost enough credits to have a Ph.D. And yet somehow I do not even have an associates degree. Constantly being turned down for work because I do not have a piece of paper that says I know what I know even though I have hundreds of projects that say otherwise.It was definitely a huge waste of time and money, and nothing I learned was useful in industry.College breaks your creativity. It doesn‚Äôt teach you how to think for yourself. It teaches you how to be complacent and fall in line. College teaches you how to work for someone else, not how to better yourself.That all being said, I do hope to go back someday and finally finish my degrees so that is wasn‚Äôt all for nothing.",30/03/2019,0,0,8,7,1050,268,3,0,0,6,82

It also makes more sense from the overall energy perspective:When we wake up in the morning, we have the highest, creative, ‚Äúdoing‚Äù energy. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve probably heard that you should do the 3 most important things within the 3 hours of waking up. You may also have heard that you should do the mentally demanding work (e.g. creating, strategizing, and urgent work) in the morning and do the routine work (e.g. administrative work, meetings) in the afternoon.Our energy level goes from a high point (the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù energy) to a low point (the ‚Äúbeing‚Äù energy) gradually in a day.That‚Äôs why the wind-down activities like spiritual courses feel more natural and comfortable in the evening.Another beautiful way to put it is ‚Äúheart activities‚Äù. ‚ÄúHeart activities‚Äù connect with your heart, instead of with your mind: Such as exercise, singing, painting, spiritual work.

They are the information gathering tasks.Part of my job is to develop the China market. Another part of my job is creating a marketing strategy for my department. Both tasks require me to keep an eye on the industry such as checking Google alerts and browsing creative marketing campaigns.Initially, I tried to do those tasks in the morning. Mornings are for important tasks. By scheduling them in the morning automatically reminds me subconsciously that ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre important. You better stick with it.‚ÄùBut the information-gathering tasks are always ‚Äúoverwritten‚Äù by other more urgent tasks.Then, I tried to schedule them in the afternoon ‚Äî I‚Äôve tried both early afternoons and late afternoons. None of those slots worked very well and I always put them off for one reason or another.Until one day, I managed to convince myself to browse the news, I found an interesting company there. Then, I searched for ways to reach out to that company, which immediately set me off.That was an AHA moment!The best time to browse news is not in the morning, nor in the afternoon, it‚Äôs right before I plan to do business development!Because I‚Äôve unconsciously created a story line in my head that made sense of everything: first, we look at what‚Äôs going on; second, based on what‚Äôs going on, let‚Äôs find the relevant players for my business. The story line made both tasks more meaningful than being looked at alone. A story line helps ‚Äúchunk‚Äù a number of relevant tasks together for much higher productivity.Pause and think for yourself:What is one habit you‚Äôve always wanted to stick to? Do you need a better story to prep yourself? E.g. if you want to play the piano every day, would it help motivate you to listen to some amazing Chopin before that?In my previous posts after 30 days, 60 days, 90 days of experiments, other than the positive comments (which I‚Äôm hugely grateful for), I‚Äôve also gotten some negative ones:Can you just relax? Your purpose and passion will make themselves known to you without the fanatic search.It seems like you want to know and control your thoughts, but for what?They definitely have a point! I can relax without the fanatic search or without following a strict system that makes people feel burnout just by reading it, but I can also tell you that that‚Äôd not be me.I love systems. The more bulletproof, the better. If I just ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and be spontaneous, I‚Äôd feel miserable. Of course, this is not for everyone, maybe not even for the majority. I know people who do very well being flexible. It‚Äôs a highly personal preference.It‚Äôs hard to explain in a few sentences whether you should ‚Äúwait‚Äù for the right idea to dawn on you or you should go look for it. But for me, ‚Äúactively looking for it‚Äù is what feels right and what actually relaxes me.Other interesting comments:It seems like you‚Äôre not enjoying life and spending time with friends and family.When I have a schedule, a meeting pops up and I have to deal with it. And I lose my focus easily. I have many different things to deal with daily and I find it difficult to build my own schedule. Did you have this kind of difficulty?What hasn‚Äôt been made crystal clear in the previous posts is: I follow the 80/20 rule religiously, at least in 3 ways:Another thing worth mentioning is, every day, when we wake up, we feel like we‚Äôve got 100 things to attend to. It‚Äôs true for you, me and millions of other people. What I do is ask myself:What are the 3 things I should do today that will make today fulfilling?I use the answer to fend off distractions.80/20 rule is the basis for a strict system to work.",30/03/2019,1,0,17,5,1050,297,3,2,0,11,184
Momentum Investing: Be Like The Secretariat,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/momentum-investing-be-like-the-secretariat-5d27521ba10,Amrut Patil,560,7,1113,"Few weeks ago I was watching the movie Secretariat. Secretariat was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. If you haven‚Äôt watched this movie yet, it is a must watch and you will get some good life lessons.Everyone loves cheering and rooting for the winners. Imagine watching the Kentucky Derby, an annual horse race for three-year-old thoroughbreds. As the race begins, the horse at the far right end of the track pulls ahead of others. Let‚Äôs say you have a bet with your friends that this horse is going to win. As this horse makes long strides to the finish line and continues to keep the lead, you get excited as your success is tied to the horse‚Äôs win.This type of reasoning forms the basis behind the strategy known as momentum investing.Momentum investing is a strategy based on the idea that you can earn long-term profits by buying and holding stocks while they are on a good run, i.e. they have momentum behind them and selling them as soon as they start losing momentum.‚ÄúI believe that more money can be made buying high and selling at even higher prices. I try to buy stocks that have already had good price moves, that are often making new highs and that have positive relative strength.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Driehaus told Crain‚Äôs Chicago Business in 2004A research study published in Journal of Finance in 1993 by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman, both at UCLA Anderson at the time, noted that if an investor purchased past winners and sold past losers, they would have received ‚Äúsignificant abnormal returns‚Äù between 1965 and 1989.The authors established the basic time frame for momentum-investing success as a three-to-12-month window on either side. In other words, a stock‚Äôs relative performance over the previous three to 12 months typically predicted its relative performance for the following three to 12 months. They measured various time combinations of prior returns and future returns within those windows and found trading them to be ‚Äúon average quite profitable‚Äù strategies.Momentum investing flies in the face of conventional long-term buy-and-hold investing approach. It is essentially the opposite of the old tried and true Wall Street adage that investors should ‚Äúbuy low and sell high‚Äù. You sell the losers and let the winners ride while re-investing the money from the losers in other stocks that are beginning to gain momentum.Momentum investing seeks to take advantage of market volatility by taking short-term positions in stocks going up and selling them as soon as they show signs of going down, then moving the capital to a new position. In this case, the market volatility is like waves in the ocean, and you are sailing up the crest of one, only to jump to the next wave before the first crashes down again.Consider the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker: MTUM). performance above. This ETF follows a momentum investing strategy. Over the last five years (through October 18, 2018), the iShares Edge MSCI Momentum Factor ETF gained an average of 15.5 percent per year. That outperformed the S&P 500 return of about 12 percent per year.Investors either overreact to important information, or they underreact to it. Because, after all, we‚Äôre only human.Featured Research by Avanidhar SubrahmanyamHere‚Äôs a look at the annual performance of the MSCI USA Momentum Index compared to its parent index, the MSCI USA Index, as well as the S&P 500, dating back to 2008 (the year of the financial crisis).As you can see, the MSCI USA Momentum Index beat the other two indexes in seven of the last 11 years. However, it is notable that during the year of the financial crisis in 2008, the index performed worse than other indexes. This makes it evident that momentum investing can add to growth during periods of good stock market growth, but fails to protect capital well during bad times.Momentum investing requires a disciplined rules-based approach to identify trends, volatility, overcrowding, and hidden traps that reduce profits. Market participants regularly ignore these rules, blinded by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). They think they‚Äôll miss the rally or the sell-off while everyone else books windfall profits.Following rules can be followed as you are starting out:Choose liquid stocks or ETFs when engaging in momentum strategies. Stay away from leveraged (2x, 3x) or inverse ETFs because their price swings don‚Äôt accurately track underlying indices or futures markets due to complex fund construction.For example, the iShares Edge MCSI U.S.A. Momentum Factor ETF [Ticker: MTUM] and the SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF [Ticker: ONEO] can help someone use a momentum investing approach without selecting individual securities. They can also help you save money, as the ETFs will adjust their holdings on their own, thus freeing you from the commissions and tax implications that often come with frequent buying and selling.The momentum strategy will fail if the risk is not taken into account. Wait for a momentum move to be confirmed before taking on a stock position. Do not wait to close the position until saturation has been reached. Keep an eye on changing trends, reversal signals or news that might take the market by surprise. Failing to act quickly to close a bad position, thereby riding the momentum train the wrong way will lead to huge losses.There are many upsides that make momentum investing a smart choice:With the right framework in place, momentum investing can often lead to impressive returns if done properly. Stay tuned for my next article where I will discuss how you can begin building this framework using popular momentum indicators used by Wall Street professionals.If you enjoyed reading this article, please leave your comments or hit the clap icon below to show your appreciation.

The Easiest Way to Build Debian Installer for Your Application,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-easiest-way-to-build-debian-installer-for-your-application-d1468179a7c0,Kosala Sananthana,196,7,1120,"The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian.If we need to install a program or an application on Debian system we can use a Debian Installer as known as Debian Package. Whether there are many methods are available, using a Debian package is the easiest way for that. üòáA Debian package is a collection of files that allow for applications or libraries to be distributed via the Debian package management system. The aim of packaging is to allow the automation of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for Debian in a consistent manner. ( Source: Debian Wiki)A Debian package consists of one source package component and one or more binary package components. Debian Policy requires that these package files are built with a particular structure and format but there are many methods of arriving at these files.Source packages not only contain the upstream source distribution and options for the Debian package build system but also lists of run-time dependencies and conflicting packages, a machine-readable description of copyright and license information, initial configurations, etc.While the goal of packaging is to produce application distribution‚Äôs files, however, it will do the initial configuration process also. The binary packages (.deb) will be built for you by tools such as dpkg-deb. dpkg-deb packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian archives. This tool is already available in Debian system.To build a debian package you can simply use the following command.This will create a debian package from the filesystem tree stored in binary-directory. binary-directory must have a DEBIAN sub-directory, which contains the control information files such as the control file itself. This directory will not appear in the binary package‚Äôs filesystem archive, but instead the files in it will be put in the binary package‚Äôs control information area. It will check the file for syntax errors and other problems, and display the name of the binary package being built. dpkg-deb will also check the permissions of the maintainer scripts and other files found in the DEBIAN control information directory.If no package is specified then dpkg-deb will write the package into the file binary-directory.deb.If the archive to be created already exists it will be overwritten. If the second argument is a directory then dpkg-deb will write to the file directory/package_version_arch.deb.As described above the DEBIAN sub-directory should be in the package directory when you build the debian package and DEBIAN sub-directory may contain following files.The usage and the configurations of control file will be discussed in the next section and you can get a basic idea of maintainer scripts and their usage from Introduction to Debian Maintainer Script Flow Charts article. If have not read that please read it before start the next section. It will cover all the debian package processes and configurations.In this article, I am hoping to build a debian installer for WSO2 API Manager using my automated build script as an example. WSO2 API Manager addresses full API lifecycle management, monetization, and policy enforcement. It allows extensibility and customization and ensures freedom from lock-in and it has been named as a Leader in The Forrester Wave‚Ñ¢: API Management Solutions, Q4 2018 Report.First, you need to clone debian installer builder repository to your debian machine and then add needed configurations to it (will describe in the the following section). After that, you only need to run the command to build your application‚Äôs installer. Let‚Äôs start our journey.1. Clone debian-installer-builder repository to your local machine. You can clone the repository by the following command. Let‚Äôs define the repository‚Äôs home as <REPO_HOME>.2. Copy your application‚Äôs distribution files (which you need to be copied after the installation) to application directory which located at:As an example, I downloaded WSO2 API binary distribution and unzipped. Then copied all the files to ‚Äòapplication‚Äô directory.3. Modify the following files with your application‚Äôs information. You can find these resource files in the following location.contol :This file contains various values which dpkg, dselect, apt-get, apt-cache, aptitude, and other package management tools will use to manage the package.You can change the details about the debian package by modifying the above given parameters as necessary. If you want to add more parameters or change the file you can refer this debian document for control file‚Äôs parameters.In this example, I have parameterized the product name and version. However you can change the details as you wish in this file. These details will show in the installation page of the application.maintainer scripts :These files are executable scripts which are automatically run before or after a package is installed or removed. The maintainer scripts flow charts explain this automatic running flow. These maintainer scripts flow charts are the blueprint of debian package process flow. If you need to build your own debian package for your Linux application or product, you should know have a better understanding on these flow charts. You can get basic idea about all these scripts and flow charts from my previous article Introduction to Debian Maintainer Script Flow Charts.You can modify these script to do you install, update and uninstall processes with automatic flow. In the example repository, I already added some scripts with functions that support install, update and uninstall processes. You can change them according to your application.4. Change the copyright file according to your product.You need to change the copyright file which is located atFor more details about the copyright file and parameters you can refer debian document about the copyright file. In the example file I have added copyrights which needed for WSO2 API Manager.5. Run the following command to build your debian installer.Note: You should provide an application name and application version. In addition, application version should be [0‚Äì9].[0‚Äì9].[0‚Äì9] pattern. ( Example: 2.6.0 )This will start the installer generating process and after completing the building process of the installer the debian package (wso2am-debian-x64‚Äì2.6.0.deb) will be saved to following location.Bravo!! üí™That‚Äôs it. Now you can start the installation process by double clicking the .deb file.Installation process steps are given below:Then click on the install button on the screen and this will start the installation process.After the installation you can remove the package by clicking remove button if you needed.Go to the location where debian package has generated and run the following command to start the installation.If you want to purge the installed package from the system, you can run the following command on the terminal.So, You can use this automated debian installer builder to easily generate installers for your any application that can be run on debian systems. Please suggest any modifications that will improve the debian installer builder to here.Cheers!! üç∫üç∫More details on debian packages and package management :medium.comwww.debian.orgwiki.debian.org",30/03/2019,0,9,45,26,836,473,8,1,0,16,568
Which Startups Will Make It?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/which-startups-will-make-it-f8352fe469d8,Josia Nakash,252,6,1181,"Startup companies are scaling up very fast nowadays, and in many ways that has shifted the core value of the company from focusing on technology, to focusing on people. Everyone is talking about how people are a company‚Äôs greatest asset, and this has thrown HR leaders directly into the spotlight.Smart leaders are talking about the importance of maintaining a strong corporate culture, based on a specific set of values. But nobody is talking about the elephant in the room yet ‚Äî how an eruption of the human ego can cost a company everything. I‚Äôve been around startups long enough to know that when the founders start hating each other, when the internal politics consume everything ‚Äî it is only a matter of time until the company closes its doors and sends everyone home.There is actually only one entrepreneur talking about the cancer of the human ego and that is VaynerX Chairman and VaynerMedia CEO, Gary Vaynerchuk. GaryVee has been talking a lot lately about why you may have to fire your most talented employee:‚ÄúWhen I hire people, I look for ‚Äúpeople skills‚Äù far, far more than I look for talent. To me, this notion that some employee is so special or so talented that they‚Äôre allowed to be jerks to everybody else is the most ridiculous idea. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre the greatest salesperson or the best creative genius of all time ‚Äî I‚Äôm still more interested in how you treat others first.‚ÄùI have to admit I thought he was just a blabbermouth until I noticed that he had hired a Chief Heart Officer, Claude Silver, and that he considered her to be the 2nd most important person in the company ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty breakthrough stuff right there. I know he‚Äôs a hustler and social media icon, but the fact that he places so much importance on how people treat each other is very interesting. Positive human relations are the key to our sustainable future and not many people get that.But here is what GaryVee doesn‚Äôt get yet: Let‚Äôs say you fired that jerk and everyone is breathing a bit easier around the office. How much time do you think it will take for the next jerk on the team to appear? A week? A month? The human ego is growing so much nowadays that people are finding it hard to reign in their emotions. People don‚Äôt understand what to do with all that excess energy.‚ÄúNo problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.‚ÄùAlbert EinsteinGaryVee is talking about the importance of emotional intelligence, but how do we leverage that in a world where human emotion is expanding all the time? How do we convert the negative aspects of human nature to positive, in a way that benefits the whole? How can you improve your corporate culture if you are attempting to improve it at the same level as the human ego? Nowadays, in order to get significant results, we need a method for rising slightly above the human ego.The following are some tips for startups and forward-thinking leaders like GaryVee who are truly concerned with building sustainable human organizations that will last forever:We like to think we are nice people but there are many scientific studies proving how given the same conditions, people will always behave the same. Humans derive pleasure from feeling superior to others ‚Äî that is how we are designed. We have been trained from birth to be competitive in everything we do, but that is no longer sustainable now that our world is so inter-connected. In the new global stage of our existence that we are already in, we need to learn to advance harmoniously together. So our ego will have to learn some new tricks, or it will have to be ‚Äútricked‚Äù into behaving differently. One way or another we will eventually get that we have to be good to the people around us.As I mentioned at the beginning, the human ego is peaking in our time. We live in a society that rewards standing out and being the best you can be. But we are beginning to understand that this is not leading us to a good place. We are now entering a new stage where we must constantly work against the negative force of the ego that is erupting in our time. We must nurture human connections in the family, in educational institutions, and in the corporate world. Startups of all sizes are having problems getting products completed and meeting deadlines simply because people in the company can‚Äôt get along.I love the way GaryVee says he‚Äôs building a dictatorship around culture. Nowadays, you really have to be that vigilant to keep your environment positive, and advancing in the direction you want. It really is enough for one person to bring some ‚Äúvirus‚Äù (different set of values) in from outside and ‚Äúinfect‚Äù everyone in the company. So you want to constantly promote the importance of your specific set of values. Your team members agree to be ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù this way because they understand that ultimately, what you are doing is beneficial for all. They may not agree with a certain decision at times. That can be discussed openly and in a way that furthers the company‚Äôs defined goals. But they all need to be fully on board and know that if they don‚Äôt like this dictatorship, they need to find another one to belong to.Individual performance reviews may bring out the worst in everyone. They may be increasing competitiveness and generating a great deal of unnecessary tension. I believe that in the near future we will transition to only rewarding team accomplishments, and/or providing the greatest rewards for team collaboration.Successful startups have offices around the world and it‚Äôs so easy to get disconnected with all the distractions we have today. There are so many existing opportunities to connect and sync global teams, which would do wonders for overcoming existing barriers (language, culture, mentality,etc.) This requires a combination of special tech, and a special method that I will talk about in the 2nd part of this series.Please note:I chose this title after noticing that my post from 2014, Which Entrepreneurs Will Make It? was my most successful post ever ‚Ä¶.Just want to clarify that I am not an HR professional ‚Äî I am a human connection professional ‚Äî this is a new sector that will take off like crazy soon.Also want to clarify what I think about Gary Vaynerchuk and the whole VaynerMedia & GaryVee team: I used to think he was a self-centered jerk who liked hearing himself talk. But when I actually started listening to him, I realized that he is inspiring and helping a lot of people ‚Äî really lifting them up, which is super-cool. How is that for a lesson in empathy? Then he came out with his Empathy Wines brand ‚Ä¶. well, forget about it. What a genius move to get everyone thinking about EMPATHY. What could be more important nowadays?Hope you enjoyed reading this and please leave a comment below to tell me what you think.",30/03/2019,0,0,0,13,1050,231,3,1,0,16,1100

Walking On Eggshells,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/walking-on-eggshells-603b0ee42fcd,√òivind H. Solheim,2500,6,990,"She felt like she was in a big room. She thought she was hovering over the floor. She was awake and at the same time not.She was somewhere in a long dead-end street.Or was it not a dead-end street?Was the path on which she had been walking rather a dark tunnel?Where did the path go? Did it take her to a dark tunnel?She woke up.She discovered that she was in a kind of tunnel. There was no one else there. She stood in the middle of the two walls, and behind her and in front of her the tunnel stretched out endlessly.A more than one kilometer long black, wet tunnel with small lights hanging on the side walls, with some tens of meters apart?Small lights, barely visible from a distance, which all came out of the dark as she progressed.Step by step, she went on. The tunnel seemed endless, and it was dark. Black as the moonless night.Then she saw weak light. As it approached, the light glided past the eye hook. She went on, moaning steps, a firm rhythm. She sensed a draft of cold air, fresh air.Was it rather a road leading out of the dark, this? Out in the open air, with a wide horizon and plenty of air, wind and light against her face? Fresh air, wind and light, as far as the eye could see?She had thought of it as hopeless. This life, here in this apartment. In this small street. In this small town. Was it impossible to dream of a life with hope and sense?‚Äî A life with hope and sense ‚Äî such a life was not for her. She was not between those lucky ones, those who walk through life on flower petals, those who are lifted forward by perfume smells and soft expectations.Her life had rather been like walking on eggshells. Or even worse ‚Äî to tread on glass crimes.Her days had been filled with negative expectations. Sometimes even with fear. With the impossible weight of the repeated anger outbursts from people who stood near her. Her closest ones, those who were supposed to be her loved ones.Will he once more show his rage today?Will he again attack her with her accusations and critique?What will this day bring?When she began to see it, it was like a heavy burden began to lift from her shoulders.She was alone. Okay, that‚Äôs as it is. Every human is, in fact, alone.But she did not feel so lost anymore. She was alone, but she no longer felt as lonely as before.What was happening?She started to see herself in a new light. Who she was. Who she had been.She slowly felt a new insight growing inside of her. She was going to stand up. Now she was going to lift herself. Get up on her feet. Climb this steep hillside, reach the summit. Open her eyes widely, open herself to nature, the world, the universe.She wanted to open up for her own, home-made universe. The woman she knew she was, the girl they had seen without seeing her at all!To whom do I owe my loyalty?Who owns me?Who can help me, so I become the person I am meant to be?Who am I meant to be?That‚Äôs a fact. That‚Äôs how it is.I can feel stuck in my life, in my feelings, my visions of myself and the world.I can feel lost.I can feel powerless. No strength at all, just these shadows, these black gloves that want to tear me down.But I know there‚Äôs more behind. There‚Äôs more about it.I am not alone. I have myself. And I know there are others who feel like I do.I know there is more than I can see just now. Because just now, when I am in the midst of the struggle when I strive to keep myself up, I know this one thing: there is more about it.I need to trust myself.I need to see myself. See myself as I am, not as I hate to see myself.I‚Äôll walk out of this room.I make up my mind.I will move.I will change what is before my eyes.I will move my body. Moving my body means moving my mind. I will see different landscapes before my eyes.I‚Äôll walk to another place.Walking away, climbing the hillside I‚Äôll feel different. I will have new ideas, I‚Äôll think other thoughts.I am my own best friend.I owe myself loyalty.Perhaps not for all that I have done. But for who I am.

From the UK to SF for the startup environment,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/from-the-uk-to-sf-for-the-startup-environvoirment-9dc9d74ef28,Vivienne Schr√∂der,91,5,959,"For my master Anthropology at the VU Amsterdam, I am doing three months of fieldwork in San Francisco, where I am researching Tech Startup Culture. Through observations, informal talks and interviews like this one, I try to discover the daily practices and motivations of the humans behind the startups. My focus is mostly on the work-private life situation and the entanglement between humans and their business.For this interview I finally enter the Salesforce Tower. Ian Gotts works from the WeWork on the 37th floor. The view is incredible. A few years ago Ian retired after a successful exit for his previous startup. Retiring was just not the way to go for him and his team, so they got together and founded another startup.I ask him how much he works. ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôd ask my family they would say all the time. I am an entrepreneur, so I work from project to project. My world is about integration: There are times where you have to work really hard, and times you have to take time off.‚Äô Besides the startup, Ian also plays in a band. His wife is the lead singer, so it is a nice way to spend time together. In the weekends and on vacation he works in the morning. He wakes up early and his family does not. He will work while they are still asleep.Ian‚Äôs startup experience started in the UK, where the startup culture did not work for them. They came to San Francisco to do a training, and then stayed. When they sold the company they had to leave the country again. After two years in the UK they went back to San Francisco with another company. ‚ÄòThe kids have been to 10 different schools,‚Äô he says. Ian and his wife have 2 kids: their daughter is in university now, and their son is still in high school.In the UK the startup culture did not work for them.The city is fantastic, in Ian‚Äôs opinion, for three reasons: The weather, the fact that the city is small and the startup culture. ‚ÄòThere is not only more experience here, people are also more willingly to share. They have build companies and are happy to give time to others, to pass it on to the next group.‚ÄôThe startup experience here is different from the UK. Silicon Valley is more funded. ‚ÄòAnd there is no stigma in failing.‚Äô He laughs. ‚ÄòObviously not everything I worked on in the UK worked out. The first question people would ask is: ‚ÄòOh! How much did you lose?‚Äô, it is a completely different risk experience. Here people ask you: ‚ÄòWow, what did you learn from that?‚Äô It is all part of why it works better here.‚ÄôIan likes building things. ‚ÄòWe have a chance to rewrite the principles, the software and deliver our vision.‚Äô As a small company you are the brand, he explains. So he and the startup are completely intertwined. ‚ÄòThe only way to build a business is to appeal to investors and customers and, maybe most important, to employees. So yes, you and the business are one.‚Äô Ian explains there is an interesting phenomenon in tech startups: The celebrity CEO. Like, Zuckerberg.As a small company you are the brand.One of the lessons Ian learned through the years is to kill things of faster, rather than trying to save them. ‚ÄòYou waste money, time and energy. If something does not work, kill it early.‚Äô In the beginning of his startup career he would want to keep working on those things, because he spend money and time on it. Another great lesson was to have a good focus. Even if you make something that can help all kinds of people or businesses, at first you have to focus it to one group. Ask questions as: What does this niche group need? What is the most compelling market? And then, when it works, you broaden the company to the next niche.The biggest difference between working at a startup and a normal company is that Ian now has to respond to his own decision. ‚ÄòAnd not do whatever stupid decision someone higher up made.‚Äô He is no longer part of someone else‚Äôs bigger plan, he is now making his own big plan.‚ÄòI spend 0% of my time managing my career,‚Äô he says after thinking about other differences. ‚ÄòThe politics about getting a promotion are taking up so much time for employees. Often wasted time, because they don‚Äôt focus correctly. They do things that does not help their job, but their own career.‚Äô To make sure this does not happen in their own company, they eliminate the politics and give very clear objectives.When I ask Ian if he works in his free time he answers that it is all about the work-private life integration. ‚ÄòI am always at work and always available,‚Äô he says. So during free time he would respond to urgent messages, but at the same time if his daughter sends him something to read during work time, he will read and respond to that. Ian would not go a day without his phone.‚ÄòI am always at work and always available.‚ÄôDuring the wrap up of the interview Ian shares one last interesting aspect of the startup world. A less attractive aspect. ‚ÄòSilicon Valley‚Äôs dirty secret is that only a few founders will make it, and only a very very few people working at a startup will do well from that exit. However, every VC will do well. And all these people in lower positions are sharing apartments with the promise that one day they will be successful, but it is not their turn. Maybe when it is their turn to run a company and even then it is just a very small change.‚ÄôVivienne Schr√∂derTwitterLinkedIn",30/03/2019,0,0,0,1,656,545,4,0,0,3,98
The Illusion Of Quick Wins,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-illusion-of-quick-wins-be54278e45ff,Tim Denning,306000,4,730,"NOT falling for the short game will serve you well.What is the short game?It‚Äôs the illusion of quick wins and success that happens at an incredible rate without much thought.I was trying to think about how I could describe what it‚Äôs like to accidentally fall for the idea of quick wins and I thought of the perfect example.It‚Äôs 2014, I got the manager job title at my job in finance and thought I had something to prove quickly.One of my younger mentors had got me obsessed with the startup world and had begun introducing me to all the cool tech companies. Companies such as Stripe, Airbnb, Eventbrite and Square ‚Äî he even got me into the world of bitcoin which was rebellious, considering our jobs working in a bank.This was a whole new life for me and I became like Harry Potter buying his first wand from Ollivanders. The startup world was all nice and shiny, and ready for me to explore with my curious mind.One lunchtime, my young mentor, told me that we should attend a local event called Startup Grind. He told me that it would be a good place to find new clients and I fell for this lie.Before we left the office for a 6 pm start, we did something that makes me laugh looking back: we printed out leaflets and packed our backpacks full of business cards. We then told our boss that we were going along and would bring back a whole stack of customers.We arrived at the event right on time. There was an hour of networking beforehand and we both did something I cringe about looking back. As we met each new person, we gave them our business card and told them we could help them with finance.Before we‚Äôd even heard about their business or knew who they were, we were trying desperately to sell to them so we could return to work the next day and make our boss proud.After the networking part of the event was over, we sat down and listened to a speaker. It was a couple of young founders straight out of Silicon Valley. They were visiting Australia to test the waters for their new startup.While listening to the speakers, I thought about how stupid it was to slam business cards in peoples faces. It made me feel sick and it just wasn‚Äôt me.I made a decision to try a different tactic for the rest of the evening.Upon the conclusion of the speaking part of the evening, there was another hour of networking. This time around, I didn‚Äôt try and sell anything or hand out any business cards. I focused on listening and meeting as many people as I could. I smiled, I had a good time and I spoke about things I loved.What I‚Äôd done without realizing it, was play the long game.Many of the conversations that occurred that night had zero ROI.About a year later, many of the people I met that night became people I got to know really well and that led to introductions, partnerships and an increase in revenue that I could have never predicted.What I‚Äôve just described to you is what I love to call ‚Äòquick win syndrome.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs the illusion that you can meet someone for two minutes, shove a business card in their face, and then close a multi-million dollar deal with them shortly after. Business and life don‚Äôt work like that.Every now and then these illusions happen and that‚Äôs mostly just dumb luck. The rest of the time, the illusion of quick wins screws up your chance of succeeding. Taking a stack of business cards to Startup Grind was an amateur move and it resulted in zero sales.Changing the way you think about business ‚Äî to a long term focus that is not centered around yourself and your selfish desires ‚Äî is how you win in the long run.People have to respect who you are and believe in what you stand for long before they will close a deal with you.The long game I learned from Startup Grind was the game of respect. What you want to aim for is to become the respected person in your field. This takes time, and once you are respected, you will have a license to sell to more people that you could ever imagine.Respect takes time.Delete your short-term thinking.Play the long game.",30/03/2019,1,0,1,1,1012,297,4,0,0,5,123
Get a Life and Stop Avoiding ‚Äî You‚Äôre Not Cheating On Your Writing,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/get-a-life-and-stop-avoiding-youre-not-cheating-on-your-writing-de81c5f09d09,"Natalie Frank, Ph.D.",4500,9,1933,"Writing is a tough mistress. She hooks you with promises of fame and fortune, gesturing to famous authors who came before you and who are in the limelight currently. Subtly, she entices, at first without seemingly gently, suggesting that you just write when you want, whatever you want. It doesn‚Äôt have to be for anyone but you.She plies you with gifts, saying you deserve that beautiful leather bound journal to write in or the antique fountain pen, the handmade linen paper or aromatherapy fragrance pencil. You find that using these somehow makes your writing seem important.You begin to entertain thoughts of becoming a writer some day, which she silently reinforces with sunlit smiles, though you keep thinking of your writing as a hobby at least for the time being She encourages your romantic notions with quotes like, ‚ÄúA book is a dream you hold in your hand,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWords are our most inexhaustible source of magic.‚Äù It is as if she is speaking to your very soul.For the first time, you feel truly understood. She knows your unvoiced aspirations and makes them seem something other than silly. She knows how to make you feel special, talented even and banishes any doubts you have, telling you that she won‚Äôt let you fail. She makes writing seem like a sensible profession, a reasonable profession, a doable professional. You see the possibilities.You reach out to take her hand and she pulls you close, putting her arms around you. She smothers the repeated episodes of impostor syndrome and your worries about the low probability that you will make it. She cites the number of writer‚Äôs making a living at it and while you think she can‚Äôt be right, you want to believe her, so you doThen comes the day you realize you want no one but her. You quit your job, buy more writing supplies and ask her to move in. And she does. She takes up residence in your home, in your heart, in your soul and it is over. You are addicted and this is an addiction that can‚Äôt be treated and which lasts a lifetime.Like so many others I was seduced by writing at an early age and went through periods of time when I focused more attention on it. When I quit dancing and had no direction in life, despondent for a full year, I turned back to writing, first convinced I‚Äôd become a poet.I wrote everywhere, at home, when I went out to dinner with my family, in the dark of movie theaters and while at plays, when inspiration hit at my part time job at the library, and during the sampling of classes I took at the local university when trying to find myself. When I had the bad sense one day to suggest that I intended to become a poet my parents laughed at me, making me feel foolish. So I shelved my writing journals, and boxed up the pens, refocusing my attention on something they found acceptable.I went away to college and now three years behind my peers, I doubled up on classes to graduate in a year and a half. This meant taking only what I had to in order to graduate which left no room or time for writing outside of research reports and term papers.For a while my head was filled with nothing but psychology, the dream of writing being relegated to the box of childish whims packed away by my parents. I took a year and a half off, worked for a well known psychologist and then went to graduate school.On internship, I found myself returning to writing, even buying one of those journals I had once fallen in love with and a small bound book to keep track of my submissions and what I hoped would be acceptances. I continued to write poetry with some short stories and personal essays. I returned for my final year of graduate school, and with no real acceptances to my credit, once again abandoned writing for a full time focus on my studies. I didn‚Äôt return to writing until deciding to leave academia behind more than a decade later.Having enough of the politics and unhealthy, unethical and amoral nature of the academic world, I walked away determined never to return. Truthfully, once I‚Äôd walked away there was really no chance of returning as you don‚Äôt take a break from academia and then one day decide to go back. It‚Äôs an equally jealous mistress. Without any other skills to speak of, I did the one thing I felt I could at that point. I turned back to writing.It has been a rocky road. I have struggled to make enough money to live off of, a goal I have yet to realize. I have put in a lot of hard work writing, marketing, self promoting and networking. When this didn‚Äôt result in the outcome I had hoped for, one quite honestly I felt I deserved, I started to once again feel despondent.But having become addicted, I couldn‚Äôt see doing anything else. By now though, like what happens with a drug addiction, the positive feelings had largely worn off and writing was no longer fun, and rarely even emotionally rewarding. And as the number of pieces that failed to gain a popular following grew and my savings dwindled, it became harder and harder to make myself write.Part of this was due to feeling like I had to succeed in order to make quitting academia worth it. Part was due to the growing pressure of needing to establish myself in something that would pay the bills. And part of this was due to feeling like there was nothing else left to me other than writing.This last part was the worst because I was no longer enjoying it. Writing had become so difficult for me that I did what we often do when a relationship isn‚Äôt going well. I avoided it. I watched musicals on Youtube, binge watched TV series on Netflix, and spent hours a day on social media, an irony as I‚Äôm an introvert who has never been particularly comfortable being social. And all the while I denied that I was avoiding writing. I reassured myself I could and would sit down in just a little while and get some work done. Once in a while I did, but far more often I just changed avoidance methods.There was another problem. Despite not writing, I didn‚Äôt find hobbies outside of those passive ones already mentioned and these weren‚Äôt really hobbies. They were ways to waste time. I had stopped doing much of anything that was a real hobby.Before this point, I‚Äôd always had multiple projects I‚Äôd work on at a given time. Somewhere along the way I‚Äôd lost any desire to engage in the things I once found enjoyable and satisfying. Knitting, hand felting, beading, journal making, jewelry and a number of other crafting endeavors had once gone side by side with writing and one often fed the other. I now, however, found I didn‚Äôt want to do them any more, Well, that‚Äôs not entirely true. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt do them anymore.When I even considered picking up one of these hobbies, I felt guilty. I felt that I would be wasting time on something that wouldn‚Äôt amount to anything important. By important I meant something that would make money and result in a career that would make me happy and provide legitimacy in the eyes of others.I had become convinced that anything that had no chance of accomplishing one or more of those things was an irresponsible waste of time. I had committed myself to writing and it was as if doing anything else amounted to cheating. And so I continued with activities that were actually the waste of time, functioning primarily to be mindless while keeping my attention away from writing so I wouldn‚Äôt feel guilty.During this time, I was finding that often when I tried to write, I was unable to produce anything other than articles that were no more than rehashed ideas made up of parts of other stories that were already out there. Of course, this meant my writing efforts continued to gain little attention and given that there was little original content included I felt every bit like the fraud I was.Then I went back to reading. This had always been a love of mine but I‚Äôd even abandoned it when my spirit had taken a hit. Doing something that wasn‚Äôt passive and mindless helped improve my mood and led me to try my hand at some of the other hobbies I‚Äôd discontinued. The active nature of these activities continued to improve my emotional well-being and with it my outlook. With that I was able to find my way back to writing.The other creative outlets helped me focus on something I loved that didn‚Äôt give my writing mistress offense. It also gave me something with an observable result that made me feel productive. That coupled with my return to reading which helped me generate new ideas and ways of thinking about things resulted in a melding of the artistic and intellectual which provided the ideal framework for my writing. And once my writing was flowing again I could begin to focus on determining the best way to succeed at what has been a lifelong love affair.If this sounds familiar, if you find yourself avoiding your writing for no good reason, filling up your time with useless endeavors, tell your writing mistress to stop with the guilt trip. You have every right to pursue hobbies that you enjoy especially if you intend for writing to be more than a hobby. If you don‚Äôt have a creative hobby try something new in that arena and see what else it might spark for your writing creatively. From what I‚Äôve seen those creative in writing usually have other creative talents as well, so you may surprise yourself.If you are not reading other writing regularly and by that I mean daily, then you need to step up your game. I would recommend reading both fiction and nonfiction because that will help you think in different ways and sharpen different skills. While writing may be a primary part of your life fill many of your waking hours, let yourself realize that it‚Äôs healthy and necessary to have other interests, hobbies and activities that you enjoy.Keep whatever you need to participate in these activities nearby when you are writing so if you get stuck and feel like you are just grinding your gears you can easily switch your focus for a while. Make them conspicuous so they always remain an option in your subconscious and you are less likely to engage in something mindless.Mixing the creative and intellectual can often be just what you need to reopen the flow of your writing. Make time for hobbies and leisure activities along with writing every day to keep your mind in a healthy place. Your writing will be better for it.Thanks to Jen Precourt for inspiring this piece with her story, ‚ÄúWhen I can‚Äôt figure out what to write, I knit.‚ÄùNatalie Frank (Taye Carrol) has had work featured in Haunted Waters Press, Weirdbook Magazine, Siren‚Äôs Call Publications, Lycan Valley Press and Zero Fiction among others.

There Is No Perfect Speed Of Progress,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/there-is-no-perfect-speed-of-progress-8999c84704be,"Deb Knobelman, PhD",10900,4,844,"I am on vacation with my family this week.It is lovely. As I type this I can hear the ocean and feel the hot sun on my neck.I used to drag work with me on vacation. Either physically, or mentally. Scroll through unfinished projects in my mind. Worry about all the things I wasn‚Äôt doing while I was away. I‚Äôd feel guilty for not working, but then feel guilty if I did take some time to work. I wasn‚Äôt able to create clear boundaries for myself and everything blended together.I stopped doing that a year or two ago. It was hard work. But I told myself before this trip began that I didn‚Äôt have to work or write while on vacation. I set clear expectations with my clients, and with myself. And I have learned that taking a break and stepping away from the day-to-day always pays off for me. I find myself coming up with new and creative ideas. Feeling much more productive, and generally reengaging with enthusiasm upon my return.But still‚Ä¶Even with clear boundaries in my mind. Even after telling myself I was ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to relax and take a break this week. A few days into vacation and it‚Äôs hard to drown out that buzz of anxiety about not making progress.For those of us who are strivers, who are achievers, who are trying to reach goals, there is always a lingering question. What happens if we‚Äôre not working toward our goals? Who are we and what are we doing if we‚Äôre not productive?And then there‚Äôs the worst fear of all, tickling at the back of my mind. The black and white thinking that creeps up, no matter how much I embrace the reality of the gray in life. The fear that time off from making progress means that I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon and into a ditch. All the progress that I‚Äôve made is for naught. Taking a break means I will never reach my goal. A few days off means failure, and not the kind that you teaches you to grow.It‚Äôs the dark side to striving for goals. The belief that productivity is black or white in that way ‚Äî you either are or your aren‚Äôt. But I try to remind myself. Redirect my thoughts. The pursuit of goals is not the pursuit of perfection. There is no predetermined path. There is not only one way to get there. And there is not only one speed that is the right one to reach those goals.And here is the truth: there is no wagon, and there is no ditch. And the path to your goals is never going to be straight, no matter how much you plan.There are a lot of reasons that we take breaks in the pursuit of a goal. Some of them are self imposed, others are when life gets in the way. Sometimes we can have the best intentions but we simply can‚Äôt move forward at the speed that we‚Äôve hoped.But the truth is, what difference does the speed make?We set in our head that we need to achieve a certain thing by a certain date. I need to complete these work tasks by the end of the week. I need to write this many words each day to finish my novel by June. And if we go slow, or take some time off, it feels like a failure. And then we feel like a failure. And then we spend so much time beating ourselves up that we run out of time to work toward that goal, at any speed.But perfection is unattainable, as we all know.I am the kind of person that loves control. I love to think that I know what will happen in advance. But the truth is, even if I worked every day of this break, it still might take me longer than I expected to reach my goal. I don‚Äôt have that kind of control over the outcome. And sometimes, I need to allow life to unfold in all its imperfect and lumpy ways. I need to accept that some weeks I‚Äôll win the race. And others I won‚Äôt quite make it to the starting line.Fast or slow. Breaks or no. If we trust ourselves. That breaks don‚Äôt mean the end. That the steps we take can be giant, or they can be tiny. Even standing still for a week is a way of holding ground. It‚Äôs not a backwards step, like beating myself up might be. Or giving up all together. It‚Äôs a pause. It‚Äôs holding the thought. The story will continue, after this important break.If I trust that I will keep working toward my goal. If I know that I will take my next step forward upon my return. That‚Äôs all I can control. The rest isn‚Äôt up to me.So, we‚Äôre all a work in progress. I‚Äôm still trying to develop a better relationship with myself. To trust that I can take this time off. And then get back to my goals. It‚Äôs hard work. But I believe in myself.Do you?",30/03/2019,0,0,1,1,1050,268,3,0,0,6,298
Blank Page Syndrome ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How to Cure It,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/blank-page-syndrome-heres-how-to-cure-it-fc615e73dec5,Tom Hughes,143,6,1017,"You probably don‚Äôt need me to tell you how much sitting in front of a blank page sucks.As you sit at your computer, you‚Äôd much rather see page after page effortlessly unfold before your eyes ‚Äî your fingers flying across the keyboard.We all would.But no ‚Äî something has to get in the way!A blank page is usually understood to be a product of writer‚Äôs block ‚Äî the supposed mystical hindrance that inexplicably stops people from finding the right words.It strikes when you least expect it and leaves in an equally enigmatic manner.But does it really have to?Next time you sit down to write, imagine what it would be like if you could almost guarantee that a near-perfect arrangement of words would flow effortlessly from your fingers ‚Äî as if you‚Äôre being guided by the writing equivalent of a sat nav. Would you like that? What doors would open for you? Wouldn‚Äôt you be much more productive? Writing would become an incredibly fun game, instead of a stressful chore.Fortunately, the conventional narrative of writer‚Äôs block need not apply to you. Because there‚Äôs a GPS writing navigation system that can take you from point A to B with minimal detours.How about we take a look under the hood?When you‚Äôre using sat nav in your car, first you need to determine where you want to go.Much like when you‚Äôre driving, the destination you hold in mind as you write dictates the sort of ideas that flow to you from your unconscious. The time you spend writing is strongly colored by this focus.It‚Äôs like a good kind of confirmation bias. Your focus helps you filter out what you don‚Äôt need.Everything you‚Äôre about to do, as you write, converges upon what ideal you hold in your mind.Crucially, you need to ask yourself: What is the crux of my article?Encapsulate the essence of your intent in a single sentence or paragraph in the present tense.For instance, in the context of this piece I‚Äôm working on right now:I am writing an article on how to overcome writer‚Äôs block in a way that makes writing an effortless, fun, and invigorating activity. I‚Äôm providing my readers with an easy-to-apply method that will help them consistently maintain their productivity.Keep your description nearby as you write and reference it as regularly as possible.Constantly ask yourself: ‚ÄúDoes what I‚Äôve just written support my goal destination?‚ÄùThere are multiple ways to your destination.You need to know exactly how you‚Äôre going to get there. And you can‚Äôt just choose any route. It needs to be one that makes sense and isn‚Äôt too complicated.Map out a clear structure for your article that strikes the right balance between being sufficiently detailed yet simple enough to follow without becoming overwhelming.There are many ways to organize your writing. But a fail-proof skeleton structure is:Subdivide the body further. It could be a numbered list. Or it might be 3‚Äì5 subtitled supporting points. Divide it up in whatever way makes the most sense to you ‚Äî as long as it‚Äôs easy to understand and sufficiently detailed.What matters is that you have a definite direction to your writing. That way, you won‚Äôt be flailing around trying to find your place.When you‚Äôre on the way to your destination, you might encounter some problems.It could be road works. Maybe there‚Äôs been an accident that‚Äôs blocking the motorway. Or maybe it‚Äôs just damn busy.Regardless of what‚Äôs stopping you, you need to find a way around the setback ‚Äî an alternative route that allows you to get moving again.In your writing, if you get stuck, it‚Äôs likely due to one of the following problems:If you run out of ideas about your topic, go down side roads until new perspectives emerge. Read random books and articles and apply what you read to your own work. This will stimulate new ideas. I wrote about this kind of method quite extensively in my article on creativity.When you struggle to find the right word: Read someone else‚Äôs words and see if any useful words pop out. Crack open the dictionary, or better yet go to thesaurus.com and see what alternatives there are to the word you have in mind that doesn‚Äôt quite cut it at the moment.And if you can‚Äôt come up with the right sentence or paragraph to express the idea you have in mind, seek out the words of others for inspiration. There‚Äôs no need to sit there trying to force the right words into existence all by yourself. Let other writers get you out of your rut.Frankly, the solution to these issues could be boiled down to this:Find fresh words in the dictionary and thesaurus, and weave them into a variety of sentences and paragraphs that work to adequately express the focus of your article and conform to a predetermined structure. Sentences and paragraphs might automatically come to you, or they might be stimulated by the words of other writers.As you‚Äôre driving, you should see the gap gradually narrowing between your current location and your destination. If you don‚Äôt, it means you‚Äôve either come to a standstill or gone in the wrong direction and need to adjust accordingly.In the context of your writing, you need to constantly monitor how close you are to fully traversing the route you chose in Step 2.Have to come to a standstill in relation to ideas, words, or sentences/paragraphs? If so, use the methods in Step 3 to get yourself moving again.Or have you gone off on a tangent?Maybe what you‚Äôve written doesn‚Äôt support the main point of your article or the subsidiary points in the body of your article. In which case, you might need to rewrite, modify, or move around what you‚Äôve written so far.Keep checking and reiterating all the above steps until you‚Äôre done.So there you have it: a four-step method to help you to a) determine what you are going to write and b) do it quickly and with minimal difficulties.As always, this is one out of many methods you can use. Ultimately, you need to be flexible and adjust your plans where necessary. The only thing that really matters is the results you get.",30/03/2019,1,0,31,7,1050,721,6,2,0,13,179
I Made Almost $10 My First Month as a Medium Partner,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/i-made-almost-10-my-first-month-as-a-medium-partner-8cb36c81d926,Clarrisa L.,2400,4,563,"I started writing on Medium just a few months ago, so I‚Äôm still pretty new to the whole platform. And heck, I only discovered that it existed about a month before that! And I‚Äôm so glad I did.This past Fall I was feeling like I was in a rut. I was looking for something else to do in my life. I‚Äôd been running an Etsy shop as a side hustle for many years, but had started to feel a little burned out on sewing.You see, with that, even though it‚Äôs been good money, it‚Äôs still trading time for dollars. I can‚Äôt really scale up that business without scaling up more of my time also ‚Äî which I just don‚Äôt want to do.Which is why I started trying to figure out better ways of making passive income, which lead me to writing. And that led me to spending hours on Pinterest where all everyone seemed to be pinning about was either blogging, makeup or recipes.I started reading about starting a blog and I pretty quickly became convinced I needed to do that as soon as possible.I just liked the idea of blogging. Because, even though it still takes time to write and promote and advertise and social media and all the other stuff ‚Äî everything you complete and post can continue to earn you money all the dang time!I can‚Äôt say that about any of the things that I make or sew and sell to an individual on Etsy.As I mentioned above, I didn‚Äôt really even know about the Partner Program until the month after I discovered Medium. I had been reading everything that I had any time for, and quickly amassed a ‚Äúreading list‚Äù of several hundred articles.Honestly I didn‚Äôt even sign up for it immediately. It took me reading many other posts over many weeks, from people like So I took the plunge and became a Medium Member ‚Äî and shortly after that, applied to be on the Partner Program.It was an easier process than I expected- fortunately! So if you‚Äôre on the fence about it, I highly recommend it, for several reasons, but here‚Äôs a few:Granted, as I mentioned above, I only made about $10 this first month of writing behind the paywall‚Äî $9.74 to be exact. But dang, woo hoo!! I‚Äôm seriously pumped about it!It‚Äôs just given me more fuel to my fire to want to keep going, and work to build my own audience who I can hopefully help or inspire in some way.There‚Äôs really nothing to lose by just trying it. Maybe your $5 a month membership? But then again, is that really a loss when you‚Äôre gaining so much knowledge? Just by having the opportunity to read and learn from so many uplifting, inspiring, and brilliant people is seriously priceless in my opinion.I‚Äôm getting more education now than I‚Äôve had in years- and it‚Äôs practical and useful and helping me progress on a daily basis.Give it a go ‚Äî your brain and possibly your pocketbook will thank you for it!Join my email list and get 150 Free writing-prompts.Clarrisa Lee is a writer and blogger at Later-Means-Never.com and on several Medium publications‚Äî with a mission to connect with and help inspire people who are striving to overcome feeling stuck in their goals, so that they can finally achieve them and obtain the success they really want in life.",30/03/2019,4,0,5,5,1050,476,2,1,0,10,316
Struggling For a Topic? How About‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAnything!,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/struggling-for-a-topic-how-about-anything-540d0bb05f7a,,,11,0,,2019-03-30,1,0,0,0,,,0,0,,0,79
What I Learned Writing a Novel You Will Probably Never Read,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/what-i-learned-writing-a-novel-you-will-probably-never-read-8161fec3808,Steve Jones,1100,4,726,"On December 11 I decided I would try to write a novel over my Christmas break. Three months and 88,000 words later (that was some Christmas break!) I had it finished.Well, finished is a relative term. It needs a lot of editing, reorganization, reconceptualization.And on top of that, I don‚Äôt really even like it. It started from a quirky prompt that my daughter wrote, and I thought it might become a short, scary SciFi story, maybe in the YA genre.Eighty-eight thousand words is not necessarily short. Plus, it‚Äôs so scattered I really don‚Äôt know what genre it is.Hmmmm. Turns out I‚Äôm not really concerned about all this. I may look at the manuscript in a couple of months and find some good things in it. Plus, I know some very capable editors who might have some helpful suggestions.But if this story never sees the light of day, it‚Äôs okay. The exercise taught me one or two things.Okay, I know I can write books. I‚Äôve written two of them, both non-fiction, academic history. I‚Äôve also written any number of papers, encyclopedia entries, and book chapters.Sitting down to write, for me, is not really a problem. I learned to write in a small daily newspaper, where I ground out four or five stories a day. Grad school and being assistant editor on a pulp history magazine just further ingrained writing in my muscle memory.But nearly every piece of fiction I ever started I threw away. I thought it was either foolish for me to attempt, not worth doing after plunging into an academic career, or (and this is probably the main thing) that I did not have permission to pursue such a goal.While I worked on this project, I came to accept that the things I like are, well, the things I like. They are all a part of me. History, news, editorial comment, super heroes, SciFi, crime drama, ghost stories.The common thread between them is ‚Äî writing. And writing is something I can do.Permission granted.2. Research is the Key to Good WritingLike most of you, I‚Äôve read Stephen King‚Äôs On Writing. One of my mistaken takeaways from that book was that a novelist can just sit down, unburdened by research, notes, and sources, and just spin a tale.I think that may work for plot and beats, especially when you want to preserve a sense of spontaneity in the work.But plots are anchored in the truth. A story may be fiction rooted in the real world. Thus the writer needs to research the basics of history and current events; medicine and physics; geography and maps; psychology and human nature. You get the point.The same goes for what I call ‚Äúpure fiction‚Äù ‚Äî stories set in worlds which the author completely created. In creating a world, an author also creates a ‚Äúcanon‚Äù or a ‚Äúhistory‚Äù for that world. That canon ‚Äî regardless of how long, complex, or amazing ‚Äî must be consulted by anyone writing in that realm.Star Wars has its own canon. Star Trek has its own canon. Tolkien works have their own canon. The Marvel Comics Universe has its own canon. And if you are working in any one of those worlds, you had better abide by the canon. That entails research.Even if you are creating your own canon ‚Äî your own truth ‚Äî once it is established you have to remain loyal to it. That means research. Now, your research may be as simple as scrolling back 100 pages to make sure you‚Äôve got a character‚Äôs birth date correct; or it may entail consulting older works set in the same cannon.Nevertheless, it is research.I said above that nearly every piece of fiction I had ever attempted I threw away. I did actually publish this ghost story featuring Abraham Lincoln last year. Guess what? I did a load of research on it. It‚Äôs context had to be accurate to give the fiction authenticity. Dates, actual characters, real events that anchor fictional events ‚Äî all that needed research.Research doesn‚Äôt have to mean long hours in a library reading up on some arcane topic and making sure you cite your sources properly. Research may be as simple as discovering the difference between a P-51B Mustang and a P-51D Mustang. (Google it.)Regardless of the complexity, research is mandatory. If you want well grounded fiction, ignore research at your own peril.",31/03/2019,0,0,4,6,1050,459,2,1,0,3,87

Does Your Writing Stink?,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/does-your-writing-stink-b9775446c864,S. J. Gordon,271,3,590,"Maybe it should.We can all agree that it is best, when telling a story, to show what is happening rather than telling. You‚Äôll find multiple discussions on every writing community forum and chapters devoted to it in every writing how-to book. In short, we‚Äôve covered this and I‚Äôm not here to give you another lecture on ‚ÄúShow, Don‚Äôt Tell.‚Äù I am, however, suggesting that we pay more attention to a sense that is, otherwise, underestimated, underused, and, in many cases, entirely disregarded.People, your writing should stink.According to Allison Marin (Curley) at BrainFacts.org, the sense of smell, which we tend to take for granted, requires about five percent of our DNA to create and operate. When you consider all the details coded in the DNA, this is huge, and we should be paying more attention.Most people are already aware of link between scents and memory and have often experienced it for themselves. The scent of a cigar will always call up a picture in my mind of my grandfather in a lawn chair in the back yard on a spring evening. A whiff of my mother‚Äôs favorite perfume is instantly recognizable to me and always associated with her presence.Scents can also evoke emotions and this fact is something writers can exploit in our quest to show rather than tell. Mentioning the smell of baking cookies, bread fresh from the oven, roasting chicken, or hot apple pie, will surely conjure images of comfort, pleasure, safety, and home, even if it is an idealistic image. All the emotional connections to home and family will be there. Likewise, mentioning the smell of old fish, curdled milk, or last week‚Äôs banana peel, will cause noses to wrinkle and lips to curl in displeasure and discomfort. Throw in a copper or iron scent in the air and you bring out unease, tension, and fear, as we look around for the spattered blood.What if we used those emotion-evoking scents as adjectives? What if the elderly man had a smile as warm as fresh bread from the oven? Your imagination automatically supplies the memory and emotions associated with that scent and applies them to the man, adding another layer to the multi-dimensional picture in your mind. Let‚Äôs see if we can take this further.The woman had all the ingredients of a lovely face. Regular features, delicate coloring, brightly expressive eyes. But there was a certain air about her a coppery, metallic tang almost like a perfume, that made me shiver.Does the woman make you feel warm and safe? I‚Äôd venture she does not. I could have said she had a hard, calculating expression or that her eyes were cold and her expression distant. It would still give you that sense that all about this woman was not as it should be. But the use of the olfactory sense is, in my mind, more subtle and gives the reader the opportunity to build a 3-D image of the woman. I would even think that adding a description of her hard expression and her cold eyes would be redundant. Your reader already knows.Telling a story in such a way that the reader can fully immerse themselves is an enormous challenge. The advice to show rather than tell is sound and something that is constantly running around in our minds as we write. We need, however, to do more than show how things look. Adding a sense of smell opens our writing to new emotion and memories that deepen our stories and make our characters more real.So, does your writing stink?",30/03/2019,0,0,2,3,1050,766,2,0,0,5,118
The Giant Peng Bird,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/the-giant-peng-bird-5fada35fc08e,Angelique,3900,5,913,"In the desolate Northern Sea, there is a fish. Its name is Kun. The size of the Kun is thousands of miles long. No one knows exactly how big it is.The Kun transforms into a bird. The name of this bird is Peng. The size of the Peng is so great that no-one knows exactly how large it is. It‚Äôs incredible wingspan is thousands of miles wide.The ocean begins to heave when the great winds blow across the waves. The might of this powerful wind is such that it allows even the Peng bird to take flight.The giant Peng spreads its massive wings and splashes water to a height of three thousand miles. The wings generate a hurricane force, allowing the Peng to ride it up toward the sky until it is ninety thousand miles above the ocean.The Peng is in full flight. Its wings are like the clouds that hang from the sky. Its destination is the Southern Sea ‚Äî the heavenly ocean of brightness.Way down below, a cicada and a little bird laugh at the Giant Peng flying overhead. The little bird says, ‚ÄúLook at me. I fly all out and stop when I get to a tree. Sometimes I can‚Äôt fly up quite so high and have to drop down to the ground. What‚Äôs the use of rising up ninety thousand miles and then flying toward the Southern Sea?‚ÄùFrom ‚ÄúThe Tao of Daily Life‚Äù by Derek LinIn this story, the Kun fish represents your soul in an unrealised state. The fish doesn‚Äôt yet know what he is truly capable of, so he swims around in the bottom of the cold, dark sea. One day, he glimpses a different reality. He realises that he is capable of a lot more. His soul has changed because he‚Äôs seen that he has unlimited potential inside of him. There‚Äôs no going back once he realises this ‚Äî he can never be satisfied swimming around aimlessly in the dark , cold ocean again. He prepares himself, undergoes a great change and one day, the winds of opportunity blow, and he‚Äôs able to soar up to greater heights. He‚Äôs becoming all that he is meant to be, self actualising to his full potential.The little bird and the cicada watch him, but they don‚Äôt understand what the Peng bird is doing. They don‚Äôt see the purpose of living a life that strives for the self actualisation of his full potential.They‚Äôre still playing small, laughing at and criticising the bird who takes flight and reaches for so much more.I believe that this story plays itself out in our lives in many smaller ways too. Your sacred journey in life might not be to become the worlds next Dostoyevsky or J.K. Rowling, but you‚Äôll recognise your creative self in some element of the story.Many writers are still in the Kun stage ‚Äî creating often but swimming around blindly in the Northern Sea with no real idea of their true potential as writers.Some have already begun their great metamorphosis and become aware of their potential and their dreams about where they want their art to take them, and they‚Äôve committed themselves to this change. The‚Äôve glimpsed something bigger with regards to their creative-self, and they‚Äôre waiting for the right moment to take off and soar.Some have already transformed into the Peng bird, and they‚Äôre soaring, well on their way to the beautiful Southern Sea. For these writers, writing serves a bigger purpose ‚Äî it can be teaching or using writing as a form of spiritual development. Perhaps they‚Äôre committed to healing others with their words, or to bringing beauty into the world in the form their enchanting stories. Whatever their bigger purpose is, they‚Äôre enjoying the greater benefits and satisfaction of making art because they‚Äôre committed to their bigger purpose.There are also some people who are the Cicada and the little bird ‚Äî they haven‚Äôt glimpsed the truth yet, that there is more to each and every one of us, so they are still small minded and petty but big-mouthed. These are the people who create mindlessly, copying others, stealing their ideas and stories, trolling writers (and others) on social media or criticising from their comfortable couch. These people are not writers yet, but I believe that some of them would like to be. They simply lack the courage to give it a go. Once they do, perhaps they‚Äôll start their journey ‚Äî as a Kun fish. And of course, some of them have nothing to do with art ‚Äî think of all the ‚Äò‚Äúhelpful criticisers‚Äù in your life who know nothing about writing but always have something to say about it.Each one of you will know which stage of the journey you‚Äôre in. It doesn‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre still in the Kun stage of unrealised potential, or if you‚Äôve taken flight and are soaring on the wings of writerly success (whatever that means to you) and satisfaction. Perhaps you‚Äôre in the middle, undergoing your metamorphosis, waiting for the opportunity to take flight. What matters is that once you become aware of your true potential, there‚Äôs no turning back.You can‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre capable of much bigger things in your art, and then return to being small. It‚Äôs unnatural ‚Äî things do not grow backwards.I think the hardest thing for all of us is to be brave enough to take flight when the opportunity comes, and to allow ourselves to become what we‚Äôre capable of becoming.Originally published at www.angienoll.com.",30/03/2019,0,0,2,12,1050,624,3,0,0,3,124
What‚Äôs inside the box? Stimulate your writer‚Äôs imagination with powerful objects.,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/whats-inside-the-box-stimulate-your-writer-s-imagination-with-powerful-objects-599d83fabcfa,Sue Thomas,582,4,552,"See the picture of a box at the top of this article?Before you read any further down, I want you to close your eyes and imagine what‚Äôs inside it. Make sure you include as many senses as possible ‚Äî how it smells, tastes, sounds, and feels, and what it looks like.Now open your eyes and write down what you‚Äôve imagined. Write for as little or as long as you like.When you‚Äôre ready, you can either scroll down to the bottom to find out what‚Äôs inside the box‚Ä¶‚Ä¶or you can read the following first.I‚Äôve taught creative writing in lots of different settings. I‚Äôve run workshops in libraries, schools, universities, and even a prison. I‚Äôve taught writing online too. Many of the writers I worked with were already very experienced, but plenty of others weren‚Äôt. And what people most often lacked was confidence in their own creativity ‚Äî they simply didn‚Äôt believe that they could have an original thought.But what I believed was that every single one of them was both creative and original, and to prove it I often brought objects to the group to stimulate their imaginations.It didn‚Äôt need to have anything in it. You just needed to be able to imagine what was in it.It‚Äôs important to find the right kind of box for this exercise, because part of the whole thing is about mystery. So, sure, you can use an old plastic bag if you want, but a nice box or a beautifully sewn bag is possibly more likely to stir up the subconscious, and that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going with this.I often used an old wooden box which had once contained loose dried tea from India. It had a sliding lid which added to the pleasure of opening it. Sometimes I put nothing in it, sometimes just one thing, and other times I‚Äôd fill it with lots of objects and invite people to choose whatever called to them. Here are some of the things they chose most often:You will be amazed by the stories your brain comes up with when it‚Äôs given just that tiny prompt. Try it!I bought it in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, a couple of years ago. It was the only time I‚Äôve visited the Middle East. The box is made of very light wood and its top is shaved so thin that when I pull it back it feels like paper between my fingers. Those small dark sticks are pieces of incense. I love their intense aroma, a blend of sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, and (I think) orange oil. The perfume reminds me of how much I am a foreigner in almost every part of the world. That used to excite me, but these days as I get older it makes me a feel a little sad. I know I will probably never see Abu Dhabi again.If you feel inclined to add a comment and share what you wrote, that would be great.I hope this exercise took you on an adventure. I hope you feel inspired to look for more powerful objects to write about. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they‚Äôre real or imaginary. What‚Äôs important is that they show you something you didn‚Äôt expect to see.For more creative writing activities, advice, and thoughts about my own process, please check out my list ‚ÄòAbout Writing‚Äô.",31/03/2019,0,0,4,6,1050,1484,3,1,0,3,2
Writing through Trial and Error,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/writing-through-trial-and-error-19a7b7104f09,Sadia Francine,444,5,1006,"Although I joined Medium a couple of years ago, I initially joined to read some of the interesting stories that would pop up into my mailbox, nearly every day.As time went on, I started to pay for the Medium monthly subscription and my reading range expanded to all kinds of new writers ‚Äî inspiring ones, personal stories, in-depth educational pieces, etc.It can be quite overwhelming to choose which story piques your interest because as soon as you bookmark one, you somehow end up with about 10 more bookmarked in the same sitting.As I broadened my reading, it suddenly occurred to me how I used to write, as a girl, but I never quite took it seriously. It was one thing to learn how to write in secondary school, but quite another to write for an audience, without your teacher‚Äôs critical eye. I pondered on writing for a few months, but it really started to hit home when I was reading other people‚Äôs personal stories on how they got into writing. And it had nothing to do with academic degrees. It was mostly all self-taught.Ding! The lightbulb had been ignited. But then came another worry. What and how do I write? I suppose I have the basic skills, I can string a couple of words together, but is it enough to get one person (never mind a few hundred) to read it?I also had this bad habit of telling myself that I can do it and I can do it better than anyone else. Oh dear, what a bad place to start! This mentality had to go, it had to disappear fast.This was the start of my writing journey.I quickly came to realise to be able to write, you needed to practise. As I look back now, I realised how important it was that I thought differently about this journey and what I really wanted to get out of it.Now a few weeks in, it has dawned upon me slowly, that not only did I have to change my way of thinking, but I had to change my whole lifestyle. I had to start forming habits which incorporated writing habits and reflection.Writing consistently is hard work but it had to be part of my daily practise and it meant reflecting on what I did during the day. It takes dedication and making the decision to write, with 2 under 10-year-olds was going to take much more dedication that my previously warped mind was telling me. Where was my time going? Where did I have time? Can I organise writing whilst holding down a part-time job and being a mother? Yes, I could, but this would need organising and discipline.So I began to look into bullet journaling. Through trial and error of using a bullet journal, I came to the idea that my journal does not need to look fancy with brilliant pages of art. I needed it to work with me. This has taken me a couple of times to get it right, but I only needed to keep it simple and with me at all times, or I may lose or forget something important.When looking at how to strategize my writing, I needed to be able to not only look but to improve on my current skills. This involves not just on your own articles, but on many aspects; The ability to recognise the importance of others work to my own, to give positive feedback, to generate ideas from other‚Äôs topics of choice to try and create a new perspective, to read broadly and to recognise how you can improve your own writing. I had to make sure that I had to link my actions to my writing. Why would I bother reading? Why would I bother editing? Every moment where I was spending my time, was one step closer to progress and personal development.I threw myself into the deep end. Since the beginning, I have been publishing more stories now, more than my past few months on Medium and I find that words, ideas and publishing has allowed me to see where my strengths and weaknesses are.What has really struck as I write these words, is how quickly they are appearing on the page as you read (with interest, I hope). Whereas before, I have been momentarily stuck with what to write and how to make it flow. It is becoming easier. It has become lighter, but it has also become challenging (especially on criticising your own work)So when we write about whatever may be important to use, it is important that we do this through trial and error. And not to feel bad when an article receives no claps whatsoever.What is important is why you started to write in the first place. What caused to pick up that pen or start to type. Was it for income or was it for a release of emotions?There have been a few pieces of writing that I have had no luck, claps, or recognition for, but I didn‚Äôt start Medium for that. I read for the pure joy of reading other‚Äôs work and appreciating the fact that I could read stories which didn‚Äôt have a publishing company‚Äôs logo attached to it. This is what made the articles, raw, deep and personal, no matter their writing skills.Writing is a skill, a skill which needs to be worked on daily. Although I may have days where I don‚Äôt publish (that would be most days), I have those days to write elsewhere; in my journal, in my blog or even in my son‚Äôs homework book (when he decides to bring it home).I may not get anywhere with my writing, but I don‚Äôt see that as a weakness, I see it as a failure. And failing over and over again is the best place to start when taking small steps to reach your summit (even if your summit is finding peace within yourself.)Thank you for reading.If you enjoyed reading this, do let me know by sending a few claps my way!",30/03/2019,3,0,3,0,1050,416,2,0,0,4,290

Genius hits a target no one else can see.The phrase tells about competition among companies to attract and retain the most remarkable employees, or every region and country try to keep their own technologies.Happiness is a choice. You can choose to be happy. There‚Äôs going to be stress in life, but it‚Äôs your choice whether you let it affect you or not.Different generations have different needs and thoughts. There will be a re-evaluation of what makes the next generation happy. They may value simplicity over clutter and experiences over material.Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way.Innovation has always been important to humanity. It meets distribution. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. There is no monopoly on innovation by any one company, country or region. Innovation will be from everywhere. Most innovation will come from small, emerging players. The rest of the world, large companies being the partners for innovators.You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.Human will have much more freedom to spend their time making their desires. Multi-tasking, parallel working, and short-lived organizations and workgroups will be the norm.Imagine a robot capable of treating Ebola patients or cleaning up nuclear waste.There is an entirely digital world in which information communication and collaboration are comprehensive and instantaneous.

Maybe not far into the future, that information might be as outdated as the idea of nine planets in our solar system (sorry, Pluto). This might be thanks to Neuralink, a company that‚Äôs been making headlines for its controversial brain-chip interface. On July 17, 2019, the company finally unveiled its hard work in a YouTube live stream.When you first hear it, Neuralink‚Äôs pursuit sounds like it comes straight out of a mad genius‚Äôs diary; certainly, with Elon Musk at the head of the company, that image might not be a far stretch. But if you look beyond what seems to be a Sci-Fi horror movie, you can get a glimpse of quite a different future for humanity ‚Äî one that has a new, sixth sense: Neuralink.Neuralink is a device that will first be used to help paraplegics with simple tasks such as using an iPhone and making mouse clicks on a computer ‚Äî by making no physical movement. To be clear, human trials have not yet started; Elon Musk and his team are optimistic about beginning by the end of 2020, but they anchor that timeline with the fact that FDA approval is not easy. So far, Neuralink prototypes have been tested on rodents and apparently even a monkey, according to Musk.Neuralink does involve surgically implanting some components onto the surface of your brain. But brain implants are not new ‚Äî research and development have been going on, tested, and used since the 1970s. It‚Äôs just that previously, brain implants have not been considered enhancements; after all, our brains are still a big mystery, and we have only recently started decoding the genetic origins of our intelligence.Ideally, we would like to preserve the sanctity of this sacred chamber ‚Äî and I‚Äôm sure Elon Musk (as well as his team) would like to as well. At this point, though, it‚Äôs not possible. They realized this by running a test using electrodes, which are devices that are used to detect electric fields (in the brain, electric fields occur when nerves fire messages to one another ‚Äî i.e., Neuralink uses the electrodes to detect when nerves are sending messages to each other).One of the electrodes (we‚Äôll call it Electrode 1) was placed right on the neuron. Because it‚Äôs directly on the neuron, it would be able to detect any electrical field generated as a result of the neuron firing. They then placed another electrode (we‚Äôll call it Electrode 2) farther away to see if it could still detect an electric field from the neuron firing. If it could, they moved it farther and farther, until a point where Electrode 2 could no longer detect the neuron‚Äôs electrical signal ‚Äî at that point, Electrode 1 would report that the neuron is firing, but Electrode 2 wouldn‚Äôt be able to confirm it. In other words, Electrode 2 was too far from the neuron. That distance was 60 nanometers. Without getting any further into the weeds, the fact is that 60 nanometers means it would have to be inside, not outside, the skull.At the very least, the electrodes would need to reside underneath the skull. And that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôre going to do. The electrodes, along with a small receiver, will be fitted underneath the skull. No, you won‚Äôt have an antenna sticking out of your head, and no, poles are not impaling your brain.Stick out your index finger and try to imagine the chip resting on top. Now you realize just how small it is ‚Äî it‚Äôs certainly smaller than the AirPods I have in my ears right now, which fire signals back and forth with my brain caught in the crossfire. The cylindrical encasing it will be placed in is 8mm in diameter and stands 4mm tall.Coming out of the encasing will be 1,024 tiny, thin electrodes that look like microscopic threads. When I say tiny, we are looking at approximately 6 nanometers in diameter. To compare, imagine the diameter of your hair, and then divide that diameter by ten. It‚Äôs so small that something as comparatively large as a human hand just won‚Äôt be able to install it on the brain. That‚Äôs why Neuralink created a robotic surgeon, too.This robot has the ability to make the precise movements necessary to install the threads into your brain. It sounds like a simple task, but at the small scale that the threads are, it becomes a task that‚Äôs about as complicated as landing a space rocket safely back on Earth ‚Äî something Musk is all too familiar with.These things are really, really small. You really can‚Äôt manipulate them with your hand. The threads are peeled off one at a time by the robot to place into the brain‚Ä¶ So we had to build a surgical robot‚Ä¶ The surgery is not possible without the robot.- Max Hodak, President of NeuralinkThat‚Äôs because, at that scale, there are other factors that it has to consider; for example, breathing and heartbeat. Both are involuntary. Sure, a person who is not under complete sedation could try to hold his or her breath for the hour-long procedure, but can he or she hold a heartbeat? I don‚Äôt think anyone would recommend that.You might wonder if poking the brain will just end up in massive headaches from the pain. The answer is no. First of all, the brain does not have any pain receptors, so you won‚Äôt feel anything. Second of all, the electrodes are so thin. If the hair analogy isn‚Äôt visual enough, think of it like this: those electrodes are thinner than a mosquito's proboscis (that long needle that comes out when it wants to suck your blood) ‚Äî the inner part of its mouth, the Labium, is around 40 nanometers in diameter (compared to the electrode‚Äôs 6 nanometer diameter). When was the last time you felt a mosquito biting you?The Neuralink surgical robot takes the variables into account when identifying the right areas to place each electrode, minimizing the likelihood of hitting a blood vessel ‚Äî which would not be good for the brain. In the image above (you can click the source link to go straight to the point in the live stream where they show this video), the top two pieces of footage show the movement of a simulated brain with variables such as heartbeat and breathing, while the bottom left one shows what the robot sees after accounting for these variables ‚Äî a seemingly still brain.Having a bionic superbrain chip robotically implanted in your head is something that most of us would consider a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Musk and his team want to keep it that way. Software updates are already inconvenient, and always happen whenever we don‚Äôt want them to. The idea of having to make a trip to the local neurosurgeon every time the software wants to run an update takes away a glimpse of the appeal that having a superbrain might bring. So a large piece of Neuralink resides outside of the skull, as a wearable behind your ear.This wearable, called the Link, houses the software as well as the battery. This way, when you‚Äôre at 5% battery life, you can just remove the device to recharge. Same with a software update ‚Äî the processing happens on the Link.It wants to be a computer inside everyone‚Äôs brain ‚Äî one that we don‚Äôt have to carry around in our hands, and that‚Äôs undetectable in use. While Elon Musk probably likes the idea of helping out paraplegics, nothing seems to tickle him more than giving our future AI overlords a good kick below the belt. And he believes Neuralink will deliver that blow.In the [unmeasurable] future, he sees Neuralink‚Äôs brain-chip as elective surgery. That means it won‚Äôt be covered by insurance in the United States. Sorry, that last sentence was an irrelevant, sarcastic jab at the joke that is American healthcare. In all seriousness, what it means is that people will want it, not need it. It may become more common around the world than plastic surgery (maybe with the exception of Beverly Hills).[Neuralink] is not a mandatory thing. This is a thing you can choose to have if you want. This is something I think will be really important at a civilization-level scale.- Elon MuskInterestingly enough, Musk says that Neuralink won‚Äôt be mandatory, although if every other person around you has a brain the speed of a quantum computer, you might need one for yourself if you want to compete for whatever jobs there might still be for humans at that time. With the assistance of Neuralink, though, John Connor ‚Äî er, I mean, Musk, believes we can stand a chance against an inevitable Skynet.Well, from a capitalist perspective, bigger than Apple or any other existing tech giant (except maybe Amazon, because otherwise where would we go shopping with our minds?). Why do you need an iPhone or an Apple Watch (actually, why do you even need an Apple watch right now‚Ä¶) when you‚Äôve got it all in your head! The success of Neuralink will change the trajectory of future innovation. What once seemed quite innovative and still beyond reach (e.g., augmented reality glasses) now seems a bit outdated when imagining a future with Neuralink.But Neuralink can go far beyond the novelties of augmented reality Space Invaders. For example, telepathy is not that farfetched anymore. After all, the signals being received by the electrodes can be wirelessly transmitted to electronic devices, and the Link earpiece itself is an electronic device. Transferring the messages from one Link device to another would be akin to airdropping images between iPhones. Add in a bit of quantum entanglement, and maybe we can make some telepathic phone calls to our Martian families. At this point in time, Neuralink‚Äôs technology probably won‚Äôt be able to create full sentences from the little firings in your neurons, but it can be trained to translate certain firing patterns into, maybe, images. Or single words. And this type of feature can be improved over time.The speed of communication will also improve. Right now, when I‚Äôm typing, the speed at which I communicate is limited to the speed at which my fingers can gracefully traverse planet QWERTY. When I‚Äôm using my phone, it‚Äôs how fast my thumbs can weave. Even when I‚Äôm speaking, I can only speak so quickly before I get tongue twisted. But a mind‚Äôs thoughts are instant. Neuralink may eventually be able to capture those instant thoughts and transcribe them into instant communication, faster than the words can leave my mouth.Another, more edgy use could be as a replacement for drugs ‚Äî let‚Äôs start with the more acceptable, recreational ones. You wouldn‚Äôt need to drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol anymore in order to get their effects. Those businesses may end up in the industry graveyard, replaced by an app version available for $0.99 (maybe for $50, accounting for inflation). Other, more illicit ones, can be abused as well, in a digital manner. This potential does raise questions about how Neuralink intends to regulate the use of its software, including third-party development. Right now, though, governments seem to be busy handling Facebook‚Äôs Libra, so it‚Äôs a concern they‚Äôll have to deal with at a later date.Talking about concerns, there‚Äôs a list of that, too. Ransomware, a virus that locks your computer‚Äôs files and deletes them one by one until you pay a ransom (usually in Bitcoin), is a serious threat to computer networks today. Now imagine that on your brain. Hacking, software bugs, and hardware defects could be a threat to your daily life.In the less-distant future, another concern is Neuralink‚Äôs ability to not only read signals, fire its own signals ‚Äî it‚Äôs essentially able to do work on behalf of your neurons. But the brain is very sensitive ‚Äî it changes throughout an entire lifetime in response to different stimuli, including chemicals and how neurons communicate with each other. Adding Neuralink into the equation could change how our brains develop.Neuralink is undeniably an innovative project ‚Äî one expected of Elon Musk. His tendency to focus on the future, rather than the perceived limitations in existence today, guides others to see the strong potential of this technology or technologies like this one. I‚Äôm very eager to imagine more of what it will bring for the future of human intelligence. Will I try version one? At this point, probably not, but I can‚Äôt speak for future me.",18/07/2019,5,0,0,1,1040,434,6,0,0,20,656
Knowledge Graph: The Perfect Complement to Machine Learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/knowledge-graph-bb78055a7884,Sudip Chowdhury,104,5,696,"Amount of information available today on the web is astounding and it is ever-expanding. For example, there are more than 1.94 billion websites that are linked with the World Wide Web and search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) can go through those links and serve useful information with great precision and speed. In most of those successful search engines, the most important denominator is the use of Knowledge Graphs. Not only search engines, social network sites (e.g., Facebook, etc.), e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon, etc.) are also using Knowledge Graphs to store and retrieve useful information.In 1960, Semantic Networks were invented to address the growing need for a knowledge representation framework that can capture a wide range of entities ‚Äî real-world objects, events, situations or abstract concepts and relations and in the end can be applied to extended English Dialogue tasks. The main idea behind Semantic Networks was to capture a wide range of issues which includes the representation of plans, actions, time, individuals‚Äô beliefs and intentions, and be general enough to accommodate each issue.According to Wikipedia, in late 1980, two Netherlands universities started a project called Knowledge Graph which was kind of a semantic network, but with some added restrictions to facilitate algebraic operations on the graph.In 2001, Tim Berners-Lee coined the term Semantic Web which is an application of Semantic Network combined with the Web.Tim Berners-Lee stated that ‚ÄúThe Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.‚ÄùIn 2012, Google named its Knowledge Graph as Knowledge Graph.Every Company/Group/Individual creates their own version of the Knowledge Graph to limit complexity and organize information into data and knowledge. For example, Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph, Knowledge Vault, Microsoft‚Äôs Satori, Facebook‚Äôs Entities Graph, etc.So, there is no formal definition of Knowledge Graph. In a broader perspective, a Knowledge Graph is a variant of semantic network with added constraints whose scope, structure, characteristics and even uses are not fully realized and in the process of development.With every passing year, Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation Learning on Knowledge Graphs are advancing rapidly, both in scale and depth, but in different directions. On one hand, Machine Learning techniques are getting better at performing various tasks (e.g., Classification, Generation, etc.) on a variety of datasets with great precision and recall. On the other hand, Knowledge Representation brings the ability to represent entities and relations with high reliability, explainability, and reusability. Recent advances in Knowledge Representation Learning include mining logical rules from the graph.However, bringing knowledge graphs and machine learning together will systematically improve the accuracy of the systems and extend the range of machine learning capabilities. For example, results inferred from Machine Learning models will have better explainability and trustworthiness.Below are some of the opportunities that can be availed by bringing Knowledge Graph to Machine Learning:Having a sufficient amount of data to train a machine learning model is very important. In the case of sparse data, Knowledge Graph can be used to augment the training data, e.g., replacing the entity name from original training data with an entity name of a similar type. This way a huge number of both positive and negative examples can be created using Knowledge Graph.Today, the main challenge with a Machine Learning model is that without a properly trained data it can not distinguish between two data points. In Machine Learning, this is considered as Zero-Shot Learning problem. This is where knowledge graphs can play a very big role. The induction from the Machine Learning model can be complemented with a deduction from the Knowledge Graph, e.g., with pictures where the type of situation did not appear in the training data.One of the major problems in machine learning industry is explaining the predictions made by machine learning systems. One issue is the implicit representations causing the predictions from the machine learning models. Knowledge Graph can alleviate this problem by mapping the explanations to some proper nodes in the graph and summarizing the decision-taking process.Note: The above opportunities are explained in more detail in the seminar report of Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web (Dagstuhl Seminar 18371)and many more‚Ä¶",18/07/2019,2,0,19,7,857,346,3,3,0,7,915
What is Hebbian Learning?,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-is-hebbian-learning-3a027e8e4bbb,Prafful Mishra,63,3,259,"The simplest neural network (threshold neuron) lacks the capability of learning, which is its major drawback. In the book ‚ÄúThe Organisation of Behaviour‚Äù, Donald O. Hebb proposed a mechanism to update weights between neurons in a neural network. This method of weight updation enabled neurons to learn and was named as Hebbian Learning.Three major points were stated as a part of this learning mechanism :www.datadriveninvestor.comThe repeated stimulus of weak connections between neurons leads to their incremental strengthening.The new weights are calculated by the equation :This is another kind of connection, that have an opposite response to a stimulus. Here, the connection strength decreases with repeated or simultaneous stimuli.For detailed information on such neural networks, one should consider reading this.Frank Rosenblatt in 1950, inferred that threshold neuron cannot be used for modeling cognition as it cannot learn or adopt from the environment or develop capabilities for classification, recognition or similar capabilities.A perceptron draws inspiration from a biological visual neural model with three layers illustrated as follows :Response layer neurons compete with each other by sending inhibitory signals to produce output. Threshold functions are set at the origin for the association and response layers. This forms the basis of learning between these layers. The goal of the perception is to activate correct response neurons for each input pattern.Hebbian Learning is inspired by the biological neural weight adjustment mechanism. It describes the method to convert a neuron an inability to learn and enables it to develop cognition with response to external stimuli. These concepts are still the basis for neural learning today.",30/03/2019,0,0,0,1,443,207,6,3,0,5,227
Reinforcement Learning : Markov-Decision Process (Part 1),Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-markov-decision-process-44c533ebf8da,blackburn,333,14,2633,"In a typical Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, there is a learner and a decision maker called agent and the surrounding with which it interacts is called environment. The environment, in return, provides rewards and a new state based on the actions of the agent. So, in reinforcement learning, we do not teach an agent how it should do something but presents it with rewards whether positive or negative based on its actions. So our root question for this blog is how we formulate any problem in RL mathematically. This is where the Markov Decision Process(MDP) comes in.Before we answer our root question i.e. How we formulate RL problems mathematically (using MDP), we need to develop our intuition about :Grab your coffee and don‚Äôt stop until you are proud!üßêFirst let‚Äôs look at some formal definitions :Agent : Software programs that make intelligent decisions and they are the learners in RL. These agents interact with the environment by actions and receive rewards based on there actions.Environment :It is the demonstration of the problem to be solved.Now, we can have a real-world environment or a simulated environment with which our agent will interact.State : This is the position of the agents at a specific time-step in the environment.So,whenever an agent performs a action the environment gives the agent reward and a new state where the agent reached by performing the action.Anything that the agent cannot change arbitrarily is considered to be part of the environment. In simple terms, actions can be any decision we want the agent to learn and state can be anything which can be useful in choosing actions. We do not assume that everything in the environment is unknown to the agent, for example, reward calculation is considered to be the part of the environment even though the agent knows a bit on how it‚Äôs reward is calculated as a function of its actions and states in which they are taken. This is because rewards cannot be arbitrarily changed by the agent. Sometimes, the agent might be fully aware of its environment but still finds it difficult to maximize the reward as like we might know how to play Rubik‚Äôs cube but still cannot solve it. So, we can safely say that the agent-environment relationship represents the limit of the agent control and not it‚Äôs knowledge.Transition : Moving from one state to another is called Transition.Transition Probability: The probability that the agent will move from one state to another is called transition probability.The Markov Property state that :‚ÄúFuture is Independent of the past given the present‚ÄùMathematically we can express this statement as :S[t] denotes the current state of the agent and s[t+1] denotes the next state. What this equation means is that the transition from state S[t] to S[t+1] is entirely independent of the past. So, the RHS of the Equation means the same as LHS if the system has a Markov Property. Intuitively meaning that our current state already captures the information of the past states.State Transition Probability :As we now know about transition probability we can define state Transition Probability as follows :For Markov State from S[t] to S[t+1] i.e. any other successor state , the state transition probability is given byWe can formulate the State Transition probability into a State Transition probability matrix by :Each row in the matrix represents the probability from moving from our original or starting state to any successor state.Sum of each row is equal to 1.Markov Process is the memory less random process i.e. a sequence of a random state S[1],S[2],‚Ä¶.S[n] with a Markov Property.So, it‚Äôs basically a sequence of states with the Markov Property.It can be defined using a set of states(S) and transition probability matrix (P).The dynamics of the environment can be fully defined using the States(S) and Transition Probability matrix(P).But what random process means ?To answer this question let‚Äôs look at a example:The edges of the tree denote transition probability. From this chain let‚Äôs take some sample. Now, suppose that we were sleeping and the according to the probability distribution there is a 0.6 chance that we will Run and 0.2 chance we sleep more and again 0.2 that we will eat ice-cream. Similarly, we can think of other sequences that we can sample from this chain.Some samples from the chain :In the above two sequences what we see is we get random set of States(S) (i.e. Sleep,Ice-cream,Sleep ) every time we run the chain.Hope, it‚Äôs now clear why Markov process is called random set of sequences.Before going to Markov Reward process let‚Äôs look at some important concepts that will help us in understand MRPs.Rewards are the numerical values that the agent receives on performing some action at some state(s) in the environment. The numerical value can be positive or negative based on the actions of the agent.In Reinforcement learning, we care about maximizing the cumulative reward (all the rewards agent receives from the environment) instead of, the reward agent receives from the current state(also called immediate reward). This total sum of reward the agent receives from the environment is called returns.We can define Returns as :r[t+1] is the reward received by the agent at time step t[0] while performing an action(a) to move from one state to another. Similarly, r[t+2] is the reward received by the agent at time step t[1] by performing an action to move to another state. And, r[T] is the reward received by the agent by at the final time step by performing an action to move to another state.Episodic and Continuous TasksEpisodic Tasks: These are the tasks that have a terminal state (end state).We can say they have finite states. For example, in racing games, we start the game (start the race) and play it until the game is over (race ends!). This is called an episode. Once we restart the game it will start from an initial state and hence, every episode is independent.Continuous Tasks : These are the tasks that have no ends i.e. they don‚Äôt have any terminal state.These types of tasks will never end.For example, Learning how to code!Now, it‚Äôs easy to calculate the returns from the episodic tasks as they will eventually end but what about continuous tasks, as it will go on and on forever. The returns from sum up to infinity! So, how we define returns for continuous tasks?This is where we need Discount factor(…§).Discount Factor (…§): It determines how much importance is to be given to the immediate reward and future rewards. This basically helps us to avoid infinity as a reward in continuous tasks. It has a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that more importance is given to the immediate reward and a value of 1 means that more importance is given to future rewards. In practice, a discount factor of 0 will never learn as it only considers immediate reward and a discount factor of 1 will go on for future rewards which may lead to infinity. Therefore, the optimal value for the discount factor lies between 0.2 to 0.8.So, we can define returns using discount factor as follows :(Let‚Äôs say this is equation 1 ,as we are going to use this equation in later for deriving Bellman Equation)Let‚Äôs understand it with an example,suppose you live at a place where you face water scarcity so if someone comes to you and say that he will give you 100 liters of water!(assume please!) for the next 15 hours as a function of some parameter (…§).Let‚Äôs look at two possibilities : (Let‚Äôs say this is equation 1 ,as we are going to use this equation in later for deriving Bellman Equation)One with discount factor (…§) 0.8 :This means that we should wait till 15th hour because the decrease is not very significant , so it‚Äôs still worth to go till the end.This means that we are also interested in future rewards.So, if the discount factor is close to 1 then we will make a effort to go to end as the reward are of significant importance.Second, with discount factor (…§) 0.2 :This means that we are more interested in early rewards as the rewards are getting significantly low at hour.So, we might not want to wait till the end (till 15th hour) as it will be worthless.So, if the discount factor is close to zero then immediate rewards are more important that the future.So which value of discount factor to use ?It depends on the task that we want to train an agent for. Suppose, in a chess game, the goal is to defeat the opponent‚Äôs king. If we give importance to the immediate rewards like a reward on pawn defeat any opponent player then the agent will learn to perform these sub-goals no matter if his players are also defeated. So, in this task future rewards are more important. In some, we might prefer to use immediate rewards like the water example we saw earlier.Till now we have seen how Markov chain defined the dynamics of a environment using set of states(S) and Transition Probability Matrix(P).But, we know that Reinforcement Learning is all about goal to maximize the reward.So, let‚Äôs add reward to our Markov Chain.This gives us Markov Reward Process.Markov Reward Process : As the name suggests, MDPs are the Markov chains with values judgement.Basically, we get a value from every state our agent is in.Mathematically, we define Markov Reward Process as :What this equation means is how much reward (Rs) we get from a particular state S[t]. This tells us the immediate reward from that particular state our agent is in. As we will see in the next story how we maximize these rewards from each state our agent is in. In simple terms, maximizing the cumulative reward we get from each state.We define MRP as (S,P, R,…§) , where :Now, let‚Äôs develop our intuition for Bellman Equation and Markov Decision Process.Value Function determines how good it is for the agent to be in a particular state. Of course, to determine how good it will be to be in a particular state it must depend on some actions that it will take. This is where policy comes in. A policy defines what actions to perform in a particular state s.A policy is a simple function, that defines a probability distribution over Actions (a‚àà A) for each state (s ‚àà S). If an agent at time t follows a policy œÄ then œÄ(a|s) is the probability that the agent with taking action (a ) at a particular time step (t).In Reinforcement Learning the experience of the agent determines the change in policy. Mathematically, a policy is defined as follows :Now, how do we find a value of a state. The value of state s, when the agent is following a policy œÄ which is denoted by vœÄ(s) is the expected return starting from s and following a policy œÄ for the next states until we reach the terminal state. We can formulate this as :(This function is also called State-value Function)This equation gives us the expected returns starting from the state(s) and going to successor states thereafter, with the policy œÄ. One thing to note is the returns we get is stochastic whereas the value of a state is not stochastic. It is the expectation of returns from start state s and thereafter, to any other state. And also note that the value of the terminal state (if there is any) is zero. Let‚Äôs look at an example :Suppose our start state is Class 2, and we move to Class 3 then Pass then Sleep.In short, Class 2 > Class 3 > Pass > Sleep.Our expected return is with a discount factor of 0.5:Note:It‚Äôs -2 + (-2 * 0.5) + 10 * 0.25 + 0 instead of -2 * -2 * 0.5 + 10 * 0.25 + 0.Then the value of Class 2 is -0.5 .Bellman Equation helps us to find optimal policies and value functions. We know that our policy changes with experience so we will have different value functions according to different policies. The optimal value function is one that gives maximum value compared to all other value functions.Bellman Equation states that value function can be decomposed into two parts:Mathematically, we can define Bellman Equation as :Let‚Äôs understand what this equation says with a help of an example :Suppose, there is a robot in some state (s) and then he moves from this state to some other state (s‚Äô). Now, the question is how good it was for the robot to be in the state(s). Using the Bellman equation, we can that it is the expectation of reward it got on leaving the state(s) plus the value of the state (s‚Äô) he moved to.Let‚Äôs look at another example :We want to know the value of state s. The value of state(s) is the reward we got upon leaving that state, plus the discounted value of the state we landed upon multiplied by the transition probability that we will move into it.The above equation can be expressed in matrix form as follows :Where v is the value of state we were in, which is equal to the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the next state multiplied by the probability of moving into that state.The running time complexity for this computation is O(n¬≥). Therefore, this is clearly not a practical solution for solving larger MRPs (same for MDPs).In later Blogs, we will look at more efficient methods like Dynamic Programming (Value iteration and Policy iteration), Monte-Claro methods, and TD-Learning.We are going to talk about the Bellman Equation in much more detail in the next story.What is Markov Decision Process ?Markov Decision Process : It is Markov Reward Process with a decisions.Everything is same like MRP but now we have actual agency that makes decisions or take actions.It is a tuple of (S, A, P, R, ùõæ) where:P and R will have slight change w.r.t actions as follows :Transition Probability MatrixReward FunctionNow, our reward function is dependent on the action.Till now we have talked about getting a reward (r) when our agent goes through a set of states (s) following a policy œÄ. Actually, in Markov Decision Process(MDP) the policy is the mechanism to take decisions. So now we have a mechanism that will choose to take an action.Policies in an MDP depend on the current state. They do not depend on history. That‚Äôs the Markov Property. So, the current state we are in characterizes history.We have already seen how good it is for the agent to be in a particular state(State-value function). Now, let‚Äôs see how good it is to take a particular action following a policy œÄ from state s (Action-Value Function).This function specifies how good it is for the agent to take action (a) in a state (s) with a policy œÄ.Mathematically, we can define the State-action value function as :Basically, it tells us the value of performing a certain action(a) in a state(s) with a policy œÄ.Let‚Äôs look at an example of the Markov Decision Process :Now, we can see that there are no more probabilities. In fact, now our agent has choices to make like after waking up, we can choose to watch Netflix or code and debug. Of course, the actions of the agent are defined w.r.t some policy œÄ and will get the reward accordingly.Fantastic!Congratulations on sticking till the end!üëçTill now we have talked about building blocks of MDP, in the upcoming stories, we will talk about and Bellman Expectation Equation, More on optimal Policy and optimal value function, and Efficient Value Finding method i.e. Dynamic Programming (value iteration and policy iteration algorithms) and programming it in Python.Hope this story adds value to your understanding of MDP.

This book is part of my curriculum now but if it was out when I started, it would‚Äôve been on there from the beginning.Having a little knowledge about math, probability and statistics would be helpful but The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book has been written a way that you‚Äôll get most of these as you go.So the answer to this question remains open. I read it from the perspective of a machine learning engineer, I knew some things but learned many more.If you don‚Äôt have a background in machine learning it doesn‚Äôt mean you should shy away from it.I‚Äôm treating it as a start here and a continue here for machine learning. Read it once. And if it doesn't make sense, read it again.You‚Äôve seen the headlines, read the advertisements. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, data, they‚Äôre everywhere. By reading this article you‚Äôve interacted with these tools dozens of times already. Machine learning is used to recommend content to you online, it helps maintain your phone's battery, it powers the booking system you used for your last flight.What you don‚Äôt know can seem scary. The media does a great job of putting machine learning into one of those too hard buckets. But The Hundred-Page Machine Learning book changes that.Now in the space of a day, or longer if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll be able to decipher what headlines you should pay attention to and the ones you shouldn‚Äôt. Or in machine learning terms, the global minimum from the local minimum ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry the book covers this.No.What works.That‚Äôs the easiest way of describing it. The field of machine learning is vast, hence traditional books being far more than 100-pages.But The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book covers what you should know.The introduction goes through the different kinds of machine learning.Supervised learning, the kind where you have data and labels of what that data is. For example, your data may be a series of articles and the labels may be the categories those articles belong to. This is the most common type of machine learning.Unsupervised learning or when you have data but no labels. Think the same articles but now you don‚Äôt know what categories any of them belong to.Semi-supervised learning is when some of your articles have labels but others don‚Äôt.And reinforcement learning involves teaching an agent (another word for computer program) to navigate a space based on rules and feedback defined by that space. A computer program (agent) which moves chess pieces (navigate) around a chessboard (space) and is rewarded for winning (feedback) is a good example.Chapter 2, dives into the Greek symbols you haven‚Äôt seen since high school. The ones which come along with any machine learning resource. Once you know what they mean, reading a machine learning paper won‚Äôt be as scary.You‚Äôll find examples like this.This kind of language is a constant throughout the book. Many of the techno-jargon terms are described in one or two lines without the fluff.What‚Äôs a classification problem?Classification is a problem of automatically assigning a label to an unlabelled example. Spam detection is a famous example of classification.What‚Äôs a regression problem?Regression is a problem of predicting a real-valued label (often called target) given an unlabelled example. Estimating house price valuation based on house features, such as area, the number of bedrooms, location and so on is a famous example of regression.I took these from the book.Chapter 3 and 4 demonstrate some of the most powerful machine learning algorithms and what makes them learning algorithms.You‚Äôll find working examples of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Learning, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbours.There‚Äôs plenty of mathematical notation but nothing you‚Äôre not equipped to handle after Chapter 2.Burkov does an amazing job of setting up the theory, explaining a problem and then pitching a solution for each of the algorithms.With this, you‚Äôll start to see why inventing a new algorithm is a rare practice. It‚Äôs because the existing ones are good at what they do. And as a budding machine learning engineer, your role is to figure out how they can be applied to your problem.Now you‚Äôve seen examples of the most useful machine learning algorithms, how do you apply them? How do you measure their effectiveness? What should you do if they‚Äôre working too well (overfitting)? Or not working well enough (underfitting)?You‚Äôll see how much of a data scientists or machine learning engineers time is making sure the data is ready to be used with a learning algorithm.What does this mean?It means turning data into numbers (computers don‚Äôt do well with anything else), dealing with missing data (you can‚Äôt learn on nothing), making sure it‚Äôs all in the same format, combining different pieces of data or removing them to get more out of what you have (feature engineering) and more.Then what?Once your data is ready, you have to choose the right learning algorithm. Different algorithms work better on different problems.The book covers this.What‚Äôs next?You assess what your learning algorithm learned. This is the most important thing you‚Äôll have to communicate to others.It often means boiling weeks of work down into one metric. So you want to make sure you‚Äôve got it right.99.99% accuracy looks good. But what‚Äôs the precision and recall? Or the area under the ROC curve (AUC)? Sometimes these are more important. The back end of Chapter 5 explains why.You‚Äôve seen the pictures. Images of the brain with deep learning neural networks next to them. Some say they try to mimic the brain others argue there‚Äôs no relation.What matters is how you can use them, what they‚Äôre actually made up of not what they‚Äôre kind of made of.A neural network is a combination of linear and non-linear functions. Straight lines and non-straight lines. Using this combination, you can draw (model) anything.The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book goes through the most useful examples of neural networks and deep learning such as, Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (usually used for images) and Recurrent Neural Networks (usually used for sequences, like words in an article or notes in a song).Deep learning is what you‚Äôll commonly hear referred to as AI. But after reading this book, you‚Äôll realise as much as it‚Äôs AI, it‚Äôs also a combination of the different mathematical functions you‚Äôve been learning about in previous chapters.Now you‚Äôve got all these tools, how and when should you use them?If you‚Äôve got articles you need an algorithm to label for you, which one should you use?If you‚Äôve only got two categories of articles, sport and news, you‚Äôve got a binary problem. If you‚Äôve got more, sport, news, politics, science, you‚Äôve got a multi-class classification problem.What if an article could have more than one label? One about science and economics. That‚Äôs a multi-label problem.How about translating your articles from English to Spanish? That‚Äôs a sequence-to-sequence problem, a sequence of English words to a sequence of Spanish words.Chapter 7 covers these along with ensemble learning (using more than one model to predict the same thing), regression problems, one-shot learning, semi-supervised learning and more.Alright.So you‚Äôve got a bit of an understanding on what algorithm you can use when. What happens next?Chapter 8 dives into some of the challenges and techniques you‚Äôll come across with experience.Imbalanced classes is the challenge of having more data for one label and not enough for another. Think of our article problem but this time we have 1,000 sports articles and only 10 science articles. What should you do here?Are many hands better than one? Combining models trying to predict the same thing can lead to better results. What are the best ways to do this?And if one of your models already knows something, how can you use this in another one? This practice is called Transfer Learning. You likely do it all the time. Taking what you know in one domain and using it in another. Transfer Learning does the same but with neural networks. If your neural network knows what order words in Wikipedia articles appear, can it be used to help classify your articles?What if you have multiple inputs to a model, like text and images? Or multiple outputs, like whether or not your target appears in an image (binary classification) and if it does, where (the coordinates)?The book covers these.Unsupervised learning is when your data doesn‚Äôt have labels. It‚Äôs a hard problem because you don‚Äôt have a ground truth to judge your model against.The book looks at two ways of dealing with unlabelled data, density estimation and clustering.Density estimation tries to specify the probability of a sample falling in a range of values as opposed to taking on a single value.Clustering aims to group samples which are similar together. For example, if you had unlabelled articles you‚Äôd expect ones on sports to be clustered closer together than articles on science (once they‚Äôve been converted to numbers).Even if you did have labels, another problem you‚Äôll face is having too many variables for the model to learn and not enough samples of each. The practice of fixing this is called dimensionality reduction. In other words, reducing the number of things your model has to learn but still maintaining the quality of the data.To do this, you‚Äôll be looking at using principal component analysis (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) or autoencoders.These sound intimidating but you‚Äôve built the groundwork to understand them in the previous chapters.The penultimate chapter goes through other forms of learning such as learning to rank. As in, what Google uses to return search results.Learning to recommend, as in what Medium uses to recommend you articles to read.And self-supervised learning, in the case of word embeddings which are created by an algorithm reading text and remembering which words appear in the presence of others. It‚Äôs self-supervised because the presence of words next to each other are the labels. As in, dog is more likely to appear in a sentence with the word pet than the word car.The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book is covered with QR codes. For those after extra-curriculum, the QR codes link to accompanying documentation for each chapter. The extra material includes code examples, papers and references where you can dive deeper.The best thing?Burkov updates the wiki himself with new material. Further compounding the start here and continue here for machine learning label.Everything in machine learning. Those books are 1000+ pages. But the topics above are more than enough to get you started and keep you going.The topics which aren‚Äôt covered in-depth in the book are the ones which haven‚Äôt yet proven effective in a practical setting (doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be), aren‚Äôt as widespread as the techniques above or are still heavily under research.These include reinforcement learning, topic modelling, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a few others.This article started out too long. I went back and edited out the parts which were excess. Burkov inspired me.If you want to get started in machine learning or if you‚Äôre a machine learning practitioner like me and you want to make sure what you‚Äôre practising is in line with what works.

How to tune hyperparameters of tSNE,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-tune-hyperparameters-of-tsne-7c0596a18868,Nikolay Oskolkov,2900,8,1600,"This is the second post of the column Mathematical Statistics and Machine Learning for Life Sciences. In the first post we discussed whether and where in Life Sciences we have Big Data suitable for Machine / Deep Learning, and emphasized that Single Cell is one of the most promising Big Data resources. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) is a Machine Learning non-linear dimensionality reduction technique which is absolutely central for Single Cell data analysis. However, the choice of hyperparameters for the tSNE might be confusing for beginners.In this post, I will share my recommendations on selecting optimal values of hyperparameters such as perplexity, number of principal components to keep, and number of iterations for running tSNE.When teaching single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) course I keep getting questions about sensitivity of tSNE with respect to hyperparameters such as perplexity. The questions are usually inspired by this fantastic post about challenges with interpreting tSNE plots.Despite my great respect for the main message of the post, I think scRNAseq community should not worry too much about perplexity and other tSNE hyperparameters based on what they learn from that post because: a) many examples in the post come from abstract mathematical topologies which do not really resemble scRNAseq data, b) the post concentrates on extreme tSNE hyperparameters which are rarely used in the real world scRNAseq analysis.If you do scRNAseq analysis you will not avoid the popular Rtsne function and R package which is based on Barnes-Hut C++ implementation of the original tSNE algorithm. The Rtsne function has three main hyperparameters:Here, we will go through these hyperparameters and explain what they mean. Obviously, their default values might not work well for arbitrary data. Here, I am going to explain how to select optimal tSNE hyperparameters for your particular data set if you are not sure where to start.scRNAseq is a high-dimensional data (~20 000 dimensions / genes) while tSNE has difficulty dealing with high dimensions. Therefore, typically you want to reduce initial number of dimensions linearly with e.g. PCA or non-linearly with e.g. Autoencoder (see e.g. here) down to 30 - 50 latent variables (initial_dims) and use this as a new data set for feeding into tSNE. Here for simplicity we will use PCA for the pre-dimensionality reduction since PCA is great at separating signal from noise. Let us plot the percentage of variance explained by Principal Components (PCs) using scRNAseq data from Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs):Looks familiar, doesn‚Äôt it? However, how many Principal Components (PCs) should we keep for inputting into tSNE, i.e. what value initial_dims should take: 20, 30, 50 or maybe more? Here we have a dilemma: 1) if we select too many PCs, we will include ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù PCs from the tail of the plot, however 2) if we select too few PCs we might loose the signal from the data. To make this decision we recall that randomization is a friend of a Data Scientist and will compare the observed variance explained by PCs with permuted variance. For this purpose, we shuffle the elements of the expression matrix, perform PCA and check what would the above plot look like for the permuted matrix:The red curve on the first plot is the mean of the permuted variance explained by PCs, this can be treated as a ‚Äúnoise zone‚Äù. In other words, the point where the observed variance (green curve) hits the permuted variance (red curve) determines how many informative PCs we have in our data. Moreover, since we have a vector of permuted variances, it is possible to calculate the p-value of how the observed variance is different from the permuted variance for each PC. For the case of CAFs we conclude that 30 PCs should be kept for the tSNE and the rest should be ignored as their values fall into the ‚Äúnoise zone‚Äù.Perplexity is perhaps the most confusing hyperparameter of tSNE. The author of tSNE, Laurens van der Maaten, mentions in the FAQ: Typical values for the perplexity range between 5 and 50. One obvious questions that comes immediately to my mind: ‚ÄúFor how many data points? What if I have 10 000 cells, should I still use perplexity in the range between 5 and 50?‚Äù. In the next sentence of the FAQ Laurens van der Maaten adds:Loosely speaking, one could say that a larger / denser data set requires a larger perplexityThis sounds reasonable but what should be the functional form of perplexity vs. number of cells in order to capture both local and global data structures? To answer this question, one year ago I collected 43 scRNAseq data sets which were publicly available at that time, many of them were downloaded from here. Valentine Svensson has another comprehensive and much more updated list of 500 scRNAseq data sets. For each of the 43 data sets I made a few tSNE plots with perplexities varying from 3 to N/3 (default max perplexity in Rtsne function), N is the number of cells. For the CAFs data set this looked like this:Next, I went through the plots in order to select a range of perplexities where clustering looked most transparent to me, and plotted the mean value of this range of perplexities vs. number of cells for each data set. The curves for the normal (above) and the log-scale (below) looked as follows:The dependence on the log-scale looks linear, fitting linear model I obtained log(Perp) = -0.179 + 0.51*log(N). Please note the coefficient 1/2 in front of log(N), this implies that the perplexity grows as Perp ~ N^(1/2). Later I realized that this power law is very similar to the rule of thumb for selecting optimal K in the K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Indeed, in the KNN Machine Learning it is widely accepted (see for example here) that optimal K~N^(1/2). Since the intuition behind perplexity is how many neighbors each data point can ‚Äúsense‚Äù, this confirms the power law obtained above.Now let us try to analytically derive this power law. Since tSNE is based on minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, so maybe the optimal perplexity can be found from the minimum of KL? However, if we plot KL as a function of perplexity at other parameters fixed, it decreases monotonically.So there is no minimum of KL with respect to perplexity, and KL will always prefer higher perplexities despite we know that too large perplexities will lead to one big clump of points without any clustering. Therefore we need to build another Score function that includes the KL and an additional contribution that penalizes KL for too large perplexities. Assuming that the KL behaves as 1/Perplexity, a simple function which always has a minimum would be Score ~ 1/Perplexity + Perplexity. However, Perplexity is usually a large number, therefore the Score function will be dominated by the second term. A simple trick to make both contributions to be on the same order of magnitude is to normalize the second term by the number of cells N. Finally, in order to find the minimum of Score we calculate its derivative with respect to Perplexity and equate it to zero. Solving this equation leads to Perplexity ~ N^(1/2).Despite the empirical way of deriving the power law, Perplexity ~ N^(1/2), can not be considered as a proper research, it helps developing an intuition about the concept of perplexity and its relation to the number of cells. On the other hand, many things about tSNE are based on pure intuition and rules of thumb as tSNE does not have a solid mathematical background in contrast to UMAP. Therefore if you are not sure what perplexity to use for your particular data set, try N^(1/2) and you will not be too off.When it comes to the number of iterations needed for tSNE to converge, the simplest recommendation can be the more iterations the better. However, practically this is not feasible for big data sets as one might have to wait for days to reach e.g. 10 000 iterations. In contrast, if you use too few iterations the clusters might not be visible and you typically discover a huge clump of data points in the center of your tSNE plot. What to do in this case? Well, if you look carefully at the tSNE plots available in literature, you notice that the largest distance between data points is on the order of ~100. This simple rule of thumb indicates that the algorithm reached convergence and further increasing the number of iterations will only marginally change the plot. For the CAFs data set, we can observe how the scale spans only a few units at the beginning of the training and grows up to ~60 units for larger numbers of iterations such as max_iter = 1000, this also leads to more distinct clustering.In this post we have learnt that despite tSNE can be sensitive with respect to its hyperparameters, there are simple rules for obtaining good looking tSNE plots for scRNAseq data. The optimal number of PCs for inputting into tSNE can be found through randomization of the expression matrix. The optimal perplexity can be calculated from the number of cells according to the simple power law Perplexity ~ N^(1/2). Finally, the optimal number of iterations should provide the largest distance between the data points of ~100 units.In the comments below let me know which analyses in Life Sciences seem especially mysterious to you and I will try to address them in this column.

Is web crawling legal?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/is-web-crawling-legal-a758c8fcacde,Ashley Ng,223,3,426,"Web crawling, also known as web scraping, data scraping or spider, is a computer program technique used to scrape a huge amount of data from websites where regular-format data can be extracted and processed into easy-to-read structured formats.Web crawling basically is how the internet functions. For example, SEO needs to create sitemaps and gives their permissions to let Google crawl their sites in order to make higher ranks in the search results. Many consultant companies would hire companies to specialize in web scraping to enrich their database so as to provide professional service to their clients.It is really hard to determine the legality of web scraping in the era of the digitized era.Web crawling can be used in the malicious purpose for example:It is important to note that a responsible data service provider would refuse your request if:Your ‚Äújust scraped a website‚Äù may cause unexpected consequences if you used it inappropriately.You probably heard of the HiQ vs Linkedin case in 2017. HiQ is a data science company that provides scraped data to corporate HR departments. Linkedin then sent desist letter to stop HiQ scraping behavior. HiQ then filed a lawsuit to stop Linkedin from blocking their access. As a result, the court ruled in favor of HiQ. It is because that HiQ scrapes data from the public profiles on Linkedin without logging in. That said, it is perfectly legal to scrape the data which is publicly shared on the internet.Let‚Äôs take another example to illustrate in what case web scraping can be harmful. The law case eBay v. Bidder‚Äôs Edge. If you‚Äôre doing web crawling for your own purposes, it is legal as it falls under fair use doctrine. The complications start if you want to use scraped data for others, especially commercial purposes. Quoted from Wikipedia.org, 100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000), was a leading case applying the trespass to chattels doctrine to online activities. In 2000, eBay, an online auction company, successfully used the ‚Äòtrespass to chattels‚Äô theory to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing Bidder‚Äôs Edge, an auction data aggregation, from using a ‚Äòcrawler‚Äô to gather data from eBay‚Äôs website. The opinion was a leading case applying ‚Äòtrespass to chattels‚Äô to online activities, although its analysis has been criticized in more recent jurisprudence.As long as you are not crawling at a disruptive rate and the source is public you should be fine.I suggest you check the websites you plan to crawl for any Terms of Service clauses related to scraping their intellectual property. If it says ‚Äúno scraping or crawling‚Äù, you should respect that.",18/07/2019,2,0,3,0,1050,700,1,4,0,7,246

The Easiest Python Numpy Tutorial Ever,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-easiest-python-numpy-tutorial-ever-5c206c809a0d,George Seif,21000,2,387,"Want to be inspired? Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. üòéPython is by far one of the easiest programming languages to use. Writing programs is intuitive and so is reading the code itself ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost like plain English!One of Python‚Äôs greatest strengths is its endless supply of powerful libraries. Many of these libraries are written at least partially in C / C++ for speed and a Python wrapper on top for easy usage!Numpy is one such Python library.Numpy is mainly used for data manipulation and processing in the form of arrays. It‚Äôs high speed coupled with easy to use functions make it a favourite among Data Science and Machine Learning practitioners.This article will be a code tutorial ‚Äî the easiest one ever ‚Äî for learning how to use Numpy!Numpy provides several ways to create arrays of numbers. You can do so manually via the numpy.array() function if you have some custom data, or using one of the built-in Python functions for creating something more standard.Once you have your array created, you can retrieve some basic information about it. Since the array is loaded as a Numpy array already, you can use the attributes of the array directly.Whenever you wish to perform any kind of math on your data, Numpy will be an excellent choice. Numpy can perform almost any of the basic math arithmetic that you would normally apply on other Python objects (lists, sets, etc) ‚Äî but way faster!Many of Numpy‚Äôs math functions are written in optimised C code, which is much faster than any other Python implementations you‚Äôll find out there.Slicing is a very common Python operation and is relatively easy to do with Python lists. But things get messy when you try to do slicing on large, multi-dimensional objects.Numpy comes in to save the day here by providing a very easy and intuitive slicing functionality to all Numpy arrays.Once you‚Äôve got the hang of things with Numpy, you can start to explore some of its more advanced functions. These will give you full control over your arrays allowing you to handle them with ease.I‚Äôve showcased just a handful of them below.

Introduction: Fast R-CNN (Object Detection),Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/part-2-fast-r-cnn-object-detection-7303e1988464,Sharif Elfouly | shafu.eth,311,3,454,"This is the second part of a three-part series, covering systems that combine region proposals with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the first part, we covered the R-CNN system. You will need to read that first to fully understand this article. You can find it here.In this part, we will talk about the fast R-CNN system. This paper was published one year after the original R-CNN paper and directly builds on top of it. The R-CNN paper was a major breakthrough in 2014, combining region proposals with a CNN. But it had some problems:So, how did the author try to solve those problems. The major thing introduced in this paper is the following:We only have one system, that we can train end-to-end.If you only take one thing with you from this article it‚Äôs this: We combine the three different parts that we had in the R-CNN system (CNN, SVM, Bounding Box Regressor) into one architecture.This architecture looks more complicated than it actually is. It works like this:1. Process the whole image with the CNN. The result is a feature map of the image.2. For each region proposal extract the corresponding part from the feature map. We will call this the region proposal feature map. We take the region proposal feature map from the feature map and resize it to a fixed size with the help of a pooling layer.This pooling layer is called the Region of interest (RoI) pooling layer. If you want to find out more about it, here you can find a greate explanation.3. Then we flatten this fixed sized region proposal feature map. This is now a feature vector, that always has the same size.4. This feature vector is now the input to the last part. These are fully connected layers that have 2 outputs. The first is the softmax classification layer, where we decide which object class we found. The second it the Bounding Box Regressor, where we output the bounding box coordinates for each object class.The fast R-CNN trains the VGG16 network 9 times faster than R-CNN. But the amazing thing about this system is this:The inference is 213 times faster and achieves a higher mAP. Wow!In the second part of this series, we talked about the fast R-CNN system and how it tried to improve the R-CNN system. Rember that only one year passed between the two papers and the system improved dramatically, especially in inference time. This illustrates how fast the whole deep learning space moves.And again, the most important thing summarized in one sentence:We now have one end-to-end system that we can train with back-propagation.Thank you for reading and keep up the learning!If you want more and stay up to date you can find me here:",18/07/2019,2,0,8,0,1050,325,3,2,0,5,215
How to land an internship in Machine Learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-land-an-internship-in-machine-learning-20bb9b65ad79,Kacper Kubara,567,4,773,"Getting an internship in Machine Learning as an undergraduate student is tough. Really tough‚Ä¶ Most of the well-known companies are looking for Ph.D. students with publications in prestigious journals. How to increase the chances of getting an internship in ML if you can‚Äôt satisfy the above?Last year, I have spent hours sending applications to apply for Machine Learning/AI internships. As an Electronic Engineering student, I‚Äôve found it particularly difficult to get even an interview, even though I had some relevant experience in Machine Learning. During my search for internships, I have noticed a few common things which companies are looking for. Based on these facts, I have decided to change my strategy for sending CVs, which finally resulted in me getting a job as a Machine Learning Research Intern. If you are planning to apply for Machine Learning internships, or you are struggling to get one, I hope that this article will help you land your dream job!I also wrote another article that helps you prepare for the interview. Link is here.The first mistake I made, was to apply to big, well-known companies. Companies such as Google, Amazon or Apple are getting hundreds of applications per day and it is very difficult to get even through the first recruitment stage for an internship. If you feel that you have goods skills in Machine Learning, with substantial experience in this field then go for it. Otherwise, it might be better to focus on targeting smaller, less known companies to maximize your chances of getting hired. For example, have a look at the required basic qualifications for Machine Learning Intern at Amazon:Woah! You see, that is what I meant by saying tough requirements. Preferably, you should be a P.h.D. student with several publications in Machine Learning. If you are undergraduate, like me, you are clearly at the disadvantage here.Have a look if there any companies around you which are involved with Machine Learning. Email them, or contact them on LinkedIn to ask whether they offer internships in ML. There is a chance that they do, which puts you in a quite good position because there won‚Äôt be that many applicants, and the job requirements shouldn‚Äôt be that high.Another thing you could do is to ask professors at your University whose research is focused on ML. They might be looking for help in research projects or know relevant people in the industry. That‚Äôs also how I got my internship in Cyber Physical Systems Research Group last year.Invest a lot of time in your self-education in ML. As you probably know, it is a very broad subject and it requires a very good understanding of Statistics, algorithms, and programming. You need to prove that you have a good understanding of various aspects of ML and that you are a good coder as well.Personal projects are a way to go! Write a kernel for the Kaggle, publish your code on the Github or contribute to open source projects. Recruiters want to have proof that you will bring a positive contribution to the company as an intern.Test yourself among other Machine Learning enthusiast by taking part in Kaggle competitions. They might be difficult at first, but it is an amazing opportunity to deepen your understanding of algorithms and it also pushes you to learn new ML concepts.Create an Artificial Intelligence Society or a study group at your university. This is what I did last year and it is just amazing how it contributed to my self-development. Being responsible for society, I had to create a lot of various material for weekly workshops and improved my leadership skills. It can also put you in the position of an ML expert at your uni! If you play it well, you can also get engaged with local companies by inviting them to give a talk or prepare a workshop session for students.Online presence really helps in networking with other people and getting recognized. You can be an expert in Machine Learning but who cares if nobody has heard about you? Publish articles regularly on Medium in ML to attract attention, or create your blog.You can also join AI conferences or events. Get out of your comfort zone and talk with as many people as you can. It is the best place to meet professionals from various companies and potentially a place to make good contact with people who can help you land an internship in ML.I hope that this article will help you get an internship in ML. Do you have any other ideas what can you do to increase your chances of getting that job? Let me know in the comments!",19/07/2019,1,0,0,2,994,612,5,0,0,12,455
The Path to Data Science: MOOC Reviews,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-path-to-data-science-mooc-reviews-7b00d8517ccf,Drew Lehe,27,8,1645,"I‚Äôve become something of a MOOC connoisseur; at this point in my journey to employment, I‚Äôve tried every major MOOC and I still dabble to keep things fresh on the brain.The great thing is, I learned a ton without spending much money. So far Udacity was the most expensive, and I got it on an interest-free loan. Often they offer discounts and many of them run on a monthly subscription for $30‚Äì50. For brevity, I don‚Äôt want to focus on the syllabus of each program here, but explain their strengths and weaknesses.Part of my motivation for doing so many courses was my interest in education; I think the MOOC format‚Äôs made a lot of bright people rethink learning, and Coursera and SharpestMinds offer an important format that could compete with some aspects of academia. If you remember nothing else, though: MOOCs are a great way to build an industry skill and augment your education; they supply you with the skill-building academia can not. They are not a substitute for academic education and you will still need toto become a data scientist. The closest one to academia would be Coursera. Ultimately I became a data scientist by using a combination of MOOCs, self-studying books, and leveraging my formal education.I highly recommend Codecademy Pro. Price is worth it and exercises really give the right amount of brainhurt, along with good explanations. I recommend clearing your progress on certain lessons and redoing them if you had trouble (reworking missed problems is good practice for anything technical).I did their essential Python 3 course to make me a better Python user, but they have a Computer Science career track which is more involved and covers topics like recursion, algorithms and data structures.The strength of Codecademy lies in its combination of code-alongs, guided projects, quizzes and videos: they are really pushing for a holistic understanding of the material. You need all those formats to truly understand something technical.Imagine Codecademy, but harder. These lessons are incredibly detailed. It‚Äôs a great place to learn, but it will take a lot of time to do even a normal mission. I love their ethos of ‚Äúquality education at a low price‚Äù ($30/month currently, $50 for the Premium plan, much cheaper if you buy a year) which makes it accessible to anyone willing to roll up their sleeves and work. For me, since I already covered a lot of these concepts, I didn‚Äôt find it worthwhile to complete any of the major certificates, but struggling through missions made me a better coder and practitioner of data science.On the Premium plan you get a monthly call with a mentor and he‚Äôll review your resume or give technical advice; take advantage of this opportunity. The most valuable thing they can give you is criticism.Dataquest offers a nice curriculum selection that will take you on up to advanced Python topics and, as somewhat of a statistics pro, I found their explanation of stats very good. I recommend going from Codecademy to Dataquest to move beyond foundational skills and get strong.My one complaint is they could turn down the difficulty a hair; there‚Äôs something to be said for repetition and plug-and-chug when learning an applied skill. However, they cover an enormous amount of material and seem to have the best SQL courses of any MOOC. They go into Redshift and really advanced data engineering stuff. I‚Äôd consider a few DQ missions essential for any aspiring data scientist and it almost makes other MOOCs obsolete.My opinion is: DataCamp‚Äôs an earnest shot at education. It‚Äôs a great place to get your feet wet and the video format is noobie-friendly. I enjoyed it at the time, but it‚Äòs only step 1 of a long process. The code-along format is like Codecademy, but you don‚Äôt write code, just fill in blanks. There is some nice brainhurt here, but it‚Äôs not the best bang for your buck.Videos (and lectures in general) aren‚Äôt a great way to teach a technical concept. If you‚Äôre totally new to data science, this is a nice place to start and get motivated, but I‚Äôd still recommend DataQuest.Many DataCamp learners (myself included) report doing a DC course then going over to DataQuest to strengthen their skills, which is something I recommend (studying the same thing from different sources is always good practice).I will say DataCamp has the best selection of R courses and if you are looking to familiarize yourself with a new R package, you can‚Äôt go wrong with DataCamp; their lecturers are world-class. It also exposes you to what good code looks like. At $30/month I‚Äôd say a few months is a good way to augment your education.This program covers the major ML algorithms and I thought the videos were helpful for things I‚Äôd already studied; they expanded my understanding of things like SVMs, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd teach it to you alone.The projects here are also good and the mini-labs (not required) are nice skill-builders. I thought the staff grading my projects were great and very thorough. They really pushed me to write good explanations of every tool I used, and justify my decisions.$2000 is the current full list price for this program, and I think they‚Äôve actually dismantled it and changed it fundamentally. The Machine Learning Engineer program I see on the site now seems smaller and focused on deployment and data engineering, whereas what I took discussed all the major ML and Deep Learning algorithms (with no coverage of deployment).Ultimately I‚Äôd say $2000 is way too much for what I got out of this, and the ‚ÄúCareer Services‚Äù from Udacity are a joke (I got a good resume review and that was it). It will, however, look good on your resume and has probably helped me land interviews.Springboard does not create much content of their own, instead linking you to free or low-cost education resources around the web. For machine learning fundamentals I think this is a good idea; there‚Äôs plenty of quality content out there so why reinvent the wheel at students‚Äô expense? It‚Äôs oriented for students making data science projects in Jupyter for the first time, and does its job well (previous MOOCs I listed are all in-browser code-alongs without pulling up your own Jupyter notebook).The really valuable asset of SpringBoard is their mentors. This was my first time seeing a lot of Machine Learning concepts and my mentor really grilled me to make sure I know my stuff. Brilliant guy.At $500/month I‚Äôd consider this program a great way to build your chops. Get ready to be challenged, earn a nice certificate, and interact with an experienced mentor. Student support from the staff and community is quite cool and staff quickly responds to emails. I wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere in data science without them.SharpestMinds offered what I‚Äôd been looking for a long time, being a guy in a smallish city with a smaller tech scene: a chance to interact with real data scientists. You need to apply to get in, and to acquire a mentor you should be like 80% of the way there on education/skillset, but once you‚Äôre in you‚Äôre golden.The other mentees are bright and about as far along in data science as I, so the community Slack has interesting projects and posts. Often in the Slack, folks will say ‚ÄúMy company‚Äôs hiring, shoot me a message if you‚Äôre interested in X topic.‚ÄùAfter walking across the graduation stage with my MS in Pure Math, I felt like someone pushed me out a plane and said ‚ÄúQuick, get a job before you hit the ground.‚Äù SharpestMinds was like the 101st Airborne Division appearing out of the sky and handing me a parachute.This is probably the best ‚Äòcareer services‚Äô of any MOOC or Bootcamp, ever, since they don‚Äôt get paid until you find a job. SM now averages one new hire every 3 days (an impressive feat considering how difficult landing an entry-level data science role is in 2019).Part of its success stems from its specificity and selectivity: this NOT a program for people wondering ‚ÄúIs data science for me?‚Äù It‚Äôs for people with significant knowledge under their belt trying to land the best entry-level DS role. You will need to work hard to with SM and build an ambitious project with your mentor, and once you‚Äôre hired you owe them a small portion of your first year‚Äôs salary (they‚Äôre upfront about this arrangement). They also put a lot of focus on your resume and online presence, and the mentors coach you with mock interviews.Essentially, this is not a MOOC or a bootcamp, but an education and career service for those trying to turn pro.Coursera:A great format for learning. It‚Äôs fundamentally different from code-along MOOCs but instead focuses on conceptual understanding. The quizzes here genuinely make you think and I never felt the videos were wasting my time.I used Coursera for an introductory R course and introductory SQL, which helped me snag a lot of interviews because employers are always looking for someone who knows SQL. I probably don‚Äôt need to tell you about Coursera, but if you‚Äôre applying for jobs, make sure you have a few of their certificates on your resume and LinkedIn; the old guard don‚Äôt know all the new MOOCs but everyone knows (and respects) Coursera.Don‚Äôt forget that, to build coding skills, you‚Äôll need to stop by Edabit or Hackerrank and see if you can level up. Start easy and don‚Äôt get ahead of yourself, make those fundamentals really strong (you‚Äôll need them when you‚Äôre slicing strings backwards and building time series graphs). People become programmers by coding hours a day for months. You will inevitably need to find interesting datasets and test your knowledge yourself on them; no MOOC can recreate this. If you want to become a data scientist, don‚Äôt just knock out MOOCs to make your resume look good; actually build the skills employers are looking for.",18/07/2019,1,0,4,5,322,278,8,1,0,1,320
Neural Style Transfer and Visualization of Convolutional Networks,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-style-transfer-and-visualization-of-convolutional-networks-7362f6cf4b9b,Matthew Stewart,6300,16,2513,"Likewise, we admire the story of musicians, artists, writers and every creative human because of their personal struggles, how they overcome life‚Äôs challenges and find inspiration from everything they‚Äôve been through. That‚Äôs the true nature of human art. That‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be automated, even if we achieve the always-elusive general artificial intelligence. ‚Äî Ray Dickson, BD TechTalksThis article will be a tutorial on using neural style transfer (NST) learning to generate professional-looking artwork like the one above. NST has been around for a while and there are websites that perform all of the functions before you, however, it is very fun to play around and create your own images. NST is quite computationally intensive, so in this case, you are limited not by your imagination, but primarily by your computational resources.All the code used in this article is available on a Jupyter notebook provided on my Neural Networks GitHub page. By the end of this article, you will have all the resources necessary to generate your own work using any images.github.comNeural style transfer (NST) can be summarized as the following:Artistic generation of high perceptual quality images that combines the style or texture of some input image, and the elements or content from a different one.From the above definition, it becomes clear that to produce an image using NST we require two separate images. The first image is one that we wish to transfer the style of ‚Äî this could be a famous painting, such as the ‚ÄúGreat Wave off Kanagawa‚Äù used in the first image we saw. We then take our second image and we transform this image using the style of the first image in order to morph the two images. This is illustrated in the images below, where image A is the original image of a riverside town, and the second image (B) is after image translation (with the style transfer image shown in the bottom left).This tutorial will explain the procedure in sufficient detail to understand what is happening under the hood. To understand this we will first have to look at some other aspects of convolutional neural networks. The following topics that will be discussed are:Time to get started.Why would we want to visualize convolutional neural networks? The major reason is that with neural networks we have little insight about learning and internal operationThrough visualization we may:We will be using an architecture similar to that of AlexNet [2] to explain NST in this article.The details are outlined in ‚ÄúVisualizing and understanding convolutional networks‚Äù [3]. The network is trained on the ImageNet 2012 training database for 1000 classes. The input is images of size 256 x 256 x 3, and the network uses convolutional layers and max-pooling layers, with fully connected layers at the end.For visualization, the authors employ a deconvolutional network [4]. The objective of this is to project hidden feature maps into the original input space. This allows us to visualize the activation functions of a specific filter. The name ‚Äúdeconvolutional‚Äù network may be unfortunate since the network does not perform any deconvolutions.Deconvolutional Network DescriptionThere are several aspects to this deconvolutional network: unpooling, rectification, and filtering.UnpoolingRectification ‚Äî Signals go through a ReLu operation.Filtering ‚Äî Use of transposed convolution.How do we perform feature visualization?(1) Evaluate the validation database on the trained network.(2) Record the nine highest activation values of each filter‚Äôs output.(3) Project the recorded 9 outputs into input space for every neuron.We can now look at the output of the layers of AlexNet using this technique.We can see from the above images that the earlier layers learn more fundamental features such as lines and shapes, whilst the latter layers learn more complex features.How do we test feature evolution during training?We can look at the feature evolution after 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 64 epochs for each of the five layers.There are a few things we can note about the network:How do we know this is the best architecture?We can perform architecture comparison, where we literally try two architectures and see which one does best. We can do this by checking if different architectures respond similarly or more strongly to the same inputs.We see in the above image that there is evidence that there are less dead units on the modified (left) network, as well as more defined features, whereas Alexnet has more aliasing effects.This is where things get a bit involved mathematically. This is necessary to understand if you want to know the inner workings of NST, if not, feel free to skip this section. This section will follow explanations given in ‚ÄúUnderstanding deep image representations by inverting them‚Äù [5].We are able to reconstruct an image from latent features. We can train layers in a network to retain an accurate photographic representation about the image, retaining geometric and photometric invariance. To make it clear, the notation a[l] in the equation below corresponds to the latent representation of layer l. Our job is to solve the optimization problem:We can also regularize this optimization procedure using an Œ±-norm regularizer:as well as a total variation regularizer:This will become clearer in the code implementation later.The steps for image reconstruction are:This procedure is used to generate the example images below.The purpose of texture synthesis is to generate high perceptual quality images that imitate a given texture. This is done using a trained convolutional neural network for object classification. We employ correlation of features among layers as a generative process. Here is an example of texture synthesis:The output of a given layer will look like this:To compute the cross-correlation of the feature maps, we first denote the output of a given filter k at layer l using a with subscripts ijk and superscript l. The cross-correlation between this output and a different channel k‚Äô is:The Gram matrix is defined as:whereGenerating new texturesTo create a new texture, we can synthesize an image that has a similar correlation to the one we want to reproduce. G with superscripts [l] and (S) refers to the Gram matrix of the style image, and G with superscripts [l] and (G) refers to the newly generated image.whererefers to the Frobenius norm. We combine all of the layer losses into a global cost function:for given weights Œª1, . . . , ŒªL.Process descriptionNow we know all of the details, we can illustrate this process in full:For further details, I refer you to the paper ‚ÄúTexture synthesis using convolutional neural networks‚Äù [6].NST was first published in the paper ‚ÄúA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style‚Äù by Gatys et al, originally released to ArXiv 2015 [7].Several mobile apps use NST techniques, including DeepArt and Prisma.Here are some more examples of stylizations being used to transform the same image of the riverbank town that we used earlier.Neural style transfer combines content and style reconstruction. We need to do several things to get NST to work:Now for the moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for, the code to be able to make these images yourself. For clearer relationship between the code and the mathematical notation, please see the Jupyter notebook located in the GitHub repository.Part 1: Import Necessary FunctionsPart 2: Content LossWe can generate an image that combines the content and style of a pair with a loss function that incorporates this information. This is achieved with two terms, one that mimics the specific activations of a certain layer for the content image, and a second term that mimics the style. The variable to optimize in the loss function will be a generated image that aims to minimize the proposed cost. Note that to optimize this function, we will perform gradient descent on the pixel values, rather than on the neural network weights.We will load a trained neural network called VGG-16 proposed in 1, who secured the first and second place in the localization and classification tracks of ImageNet Challenge in 2014, respectively. This network has been trained to discriminate over 1000 classes over more than a million images. We will use the activation values obtained for an image of interest to represent the content and styles. In order to do so, we will feed-forward the image of interest and observe it‚Äôs activation values at the indicated layer.The content loss function measures how much the feature map of the generated image differs from the feature map of the source image. We will only consider a single layer to represent the contents of an image.Part 3: Style LossThe style measures the similarity among filters in a set of layers. In order to compute that similarity, we will compute the Gram matrix of the activation values for the style layers. The Gram matrix is related to the empirical covariance matrix, and therefore, reflects the statistics of the activation values.The output is a 2-D matrix which approximately measures the cross-correlation among different filters for a given layer. This, in essence, constitutes the style of a layer.Part 4: Style Loss ‚Äî Layer‚Äôs LossIn practice we compute the style loss at a set of layers rather than just a single layer; then the total style loss is the sum of style losses at each layer:Part 5: Total-Variation RegularizerWe will also encourage smoothness in the image using a total-variation regularizer. This penalty term will reduce variation among the neighboring pixel values.Part 6: Style TransferWe now put it all together and generate some images! The style_transfer function below combines all the losses you coded up above and optimizes for an image that minimizes the total loss. Read the code and comments to understand the procedure.Part 6: Generate PicturesNow we are ready to make some images, run your own compositions and test out variations of hyperparameters and see what you can come up with, I will give you an example below. The list of hyperparameters to vary is as follows:The following code will generate the front image of this article if run for 50 iterations.Here are a couple of rough examples from my own implementation after 50 iterations:I recommend taking some of the images in the GitHub repository (or your own) and playing around with the hyperparameters and seeing what images you can make. However, to warn you, the training times are quite high unless you have access to a GPU, possibly taking several hours for one image.DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithm pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.Google‚Äôs program popularized the term (deep) ‚Äúdreaming‚Äù to refer to the generation of images that produce desired activations in a trained deep network, and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches.Here is an example of an image transformed by DeepDream.Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural NetworksWe already have a reasonable intuition about what types of features are encapsulated by each of the layers in a neural network:This works fine for discriminative models, but what if we want to build a generative model? Say, for example, that you want to know what kind of image would result in a banana. One way to do this would be to turn the neural network upside down, start with an image full of random noise, and then gradually tweak the image towards what the neural net considers a banana.By itself, this does not work particularly well, but if we impose a prior constraint that the image should have similar characteristics to natural images, such as a correlation between neighboring pixels, it becomes much more feasible.Perhaps not surprisingly, neural networks trained to discriminate between different image classes have a substantial amount of information that is needed to generate images too.This can be leveraged for the purpose of class generation, essentially flipping the discriminative model into a generative model. But why would we do this?Well, let‚Äôs say you train a neural network to classify forks. You take thousands of images of forks and use them to train the network, and the network performs pretty well on data ‚Äî but what is the network doing? What is the network using as its representation of what a fork is? This can be useful to ensure that the network is learning the right features and not cheating.Visualizing mistakesA good example of this cheating is with dumbbells. After training a network on a set of pictures of dumbbells, we use some random noise with prior constraints to ‚Äòimagine‚Äô some dumbbells and see what pops out, here is the result:As we can see, the network always generates dumbbells with an arm. However, the network failed to completely distill the essence of a dumbbell ‚Äî none of the pictures have any weightlifters in them, for example. Visualization can help us correct these kinds of training mishaps.Enhancing feature mapsInstead of prescribing which feature we want the network to amplify, we can also let the network make that decision.This can be done by feeding the network an image, and then picking a layer and asking the network to enhance whatever it detected. Lower layers tend to produce strokes or simple ornament-like patterns, such as this:With higher-level layers, complex features or even whole objects tend to emerge. ‚Äî these identify more sophisticated features. The process creates a feedback loop: if a cloud looks a little bit like a bird, the network will make it look more like a bird.If we train on pictures of animals, the network will make it look more like an animal:The results vary quite a bit with the kind of image because the features that are entered bias the network towards certain interpretations. For example, horizon lines tend to get filled with towers and pagodas. Rocks and trees turn into buildings. Birds and insects appear in images of leaves.If we apply the algorithm iteratively on its own outputs and apply some zooming after each iteration, we get an endless stream of new impressions, exploring the set of things the network knows about.DeepDream is a fascinating project, and I encourage the reader to look deeper (pardon the pun) into it if they are intrigued.I hope you enjoyed the neural style transfer article and learned something new about style transfer, convolutional neural networks, or perhaps just enjoyed seeing the fascinating pictures generated by the deep neural networks of DeepDream.For updates on new blog posts and extra content, sign up for my newsletter.mailchi.mp[1] Leon A.

Understanding the types of data in a business/organization,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-types-of-data-in-a-business-organization-67d7cb9914bd,Rendy Dalimunthe,117,4,837,"Before you start to rolling out your data management initiatives, be it Master Data Management, Enterprise Data Warehouse, Big Data Analytics or whatever it is, you need to start by understanding the very basic ingredient: the data. Only by thoroughly recognizing their characteristics, you will know the right way on how to treat each of them.‚ÄúData is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves‚ÄùTim Berners-LeeSo let‚Äôs get started!This type of data describes your core business activities. If you are a trading company, this may includes the data of your purchasing and selling activities. If you are a manufacturing company, this will be your production activities data. If you are a ride-hailing or cab company, this will the trip data. In a very basic organizational operations, the data related to the activities of hiring and firing employees can also be classified as transactional data. As a result, this kind of data has a very huge volume in comparison with the other types and usually created, stored, and maintained within the operational application such as ERP system.It consists of key information that make up the transactional data. For example, the trip data in a cab company may contain driver, passenger, route, and fare data. The driver, passenger, locations, and basic fare data are the master data. The driver data may consists the name of the driver and all of the associated information. So does the passenger data. Together, they make up the transactional data.Master data usually contains places (addresses, postal-coded, cities, countries), parties (customers, suppliers, employees) and things (products, assets, items, etc.). It is application-specific, meaning that its uses are specific for the application with business process related to it, e.g: the employees master data is created, stored, and maintained within the HR application.By now, you should get some grasp of understandings that master data is relatively constant. While the transaction data is created at a lightning speed, the master data is somehow constant. The trip data is created in any second but the list of the driver will remain the same unless there‚Äôs a new driver on-board or get kicked out.Nowadays, processes within the organization are usually so inter-dependable, which means that one process conducted in one system is related to the process conducted in other system. They may use the same master data. If each system manage their own master data, potential duplication and inconsistencies may arise. For instance, a customer may be stored as Rendy in system A, but listed as Randy in system B, although Rendy and Randy is actually the same entity. But no need to worries, there‚Äôs a discipline to manage this kind of situation. It‚Äôs called Master Data Management.Reference data is a subset of master data. It is usually a standardized data that governed by certain codification (e.g. list of Countries is governed by ISO 3166‚Äì1. There‚Äôs an easy way to differentiate reference data from master data. Always remember that reference data is way less volatile than master data. Let‚Äôs back again to our cab company. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or next week, the list of driver may change whenever there‚Äôs a new person onboard or kicked out. But I can guarantee you that the list of countries will remain the same even 2 decades from now, unless there‚Äôs a little land that declare its independence.It‚Äôs an aggregated data compile for the purpose of analytic and reporting. This data consist of transactional, master, and reference data. For example: Trip data (transaction + master) on the 13th day of July in Greater London region (reference). Reporting data is very strategic and usually being produced as ingredient of decision making process.It‚Äôs a data about data. Sounds confusing? Indeed. It‚Äôs the type of data that got me dizzy in the first time I enter the data management field. Thankfully, this beautiful picture make it easy for me to comprehend what metadata actually is.If I ask you a question: what is the color of the cat? Immediately by just looking at the data you can confidently answer my question. It‚Äôs grey. But what if I come up with another questions: when and where this picture be taken? Chances are high that you will not be able to give me the right answer by only looking at the data. And here is where the metadata come to rescue. It gives you the complete information about the data including when and where it was taken.So metadata is giving you the answer to any question that you cannot answer by just looking at the data. That‚Äôs why it said: data about data.So that‚Äôs all you need to know about the types of data. Again, this is not an exhausting explanation and I can guarantee that you will not be able yet to take on that data scientist job offer only by reading this. But you can still take all these explanation with you and answer in confident whenever someone you meet on the street ask you about the common types of data in organization.",18/07/2019,0,0,3,5,638,375,1,0,0,0,121
How to Choose Between Multiple Models,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-choose-between-multiple-models-a0c274b4228a,Peter Grant,896,6,798,"In a previous article we discussed the concepts of underfitting and overfitting, how they can lead to models that don‚Äôt match the available data, how to identify each issue, and how to identify models that do fit the data well. These concepts can help you avoid major blunders and generate models that fit the data reasonably accurately; however, there are an incredible number of models that meet that description. This means that the next step, beyond generating a model that fits decently, is identifying which of the possible models fits best.When determining how well a model fits the data set it‚Äôs important to calculate statistical values comparing the model predictions to the data set. This is beyond the scope of this conceptual article, but more information can be found in Data Science from Scratch or in Practical Statistics for Data Scientists. In this article we‚Äôll discuss the process of developing, validating, and testing models.The fundamental issue to be aware of here is that you cannot trust a model that you‚Äôve developed simply because it fits the training data well. This is for a simple reason: You forced the model to fit the training data well. If after creating a model the statistical calculations show that it matches the data well, this means that it‚Äôs possible to use mathematical methods to force a model to match the data well. What it doesn‚Äôt mean is that the model is capturing the trends that are really occurring, or that the model is able to predict other circumstances. The example of the overfit model in my previous article is a great way to highlight this.The solution to this is model validation. Validation is the practice of using the model to predict the output in other situations for which you have data, and calculating those same statistical measures of fit on those results. Note that this means you need to divide your dataset into two different data files. The first is a training data set, which you use to generate your models. The second is a validation data set, which you use to check the accuracy of your model against data that was not used to train it.Generally speaking, multiples models are created in a project. If many models are created, then the ones which best fit the training data are compared against the validation data. Then the natural choice is to select the model which most accurately fits the validation data and move on. However, this presents another potential pitfall. Similar to comparing the model to the training data, simply because model most closely matches the validation data still doesn‚Äôt mean that it matches reality. While it performs the best in this test, it could still be wrong.The final step, and the solution to that problem, is to compare the model which performed best in the validation stage against a third set of data, the test data. This test data is, again, a subset of the data from the original data source. It consists only of points that were used in neither the development or validation of the model. A model is considered ready for use only when it‚Äôs compared against the test data, and the statistical calculations show a satisfactory match.This process breaks down into the following seven steps.Once you‚Äôve developed a model that satisfactorily matches the test data set, you‚Äôre ready to start generating predictions. Though, don‚Äôt assume that this means you‚Äôre done with model development completely; there‚Äôs a good chance that you‚Äôll some day decide that you need to tweak your model based on new available data sets.The fundamental challenge discussed in this article is that a model‚Äôs performance against a specific data set doesn‚Äôt guarantee that it will perform well against other data sets. Forcing a mathematical model to match a given data set only ensures that it matches that specific data set, and doesn‚Äôt say anything about it‚Äôs predictive power.This challenge can be overcome through rounds of development, validation, and testing using different data sets. The first step is developing the model against a training data set, and ensuring that the model can accurately predict the results in that easiest case. The second step is comparing the best performing models against a second data set, the validation data set. The validation data set should include points spanning the range of values included in the training data set, but should not include any identical points. This second check goes a long way to ensuring that a model will have reasonable predictive power. The final step is to choose the model which performed best against the validation data set and compare it against a third data set, the testing data set. If the model performs well against that data set, then it can reasonably be used to create predictions.",19/07/2019,0,0,10,0,1050,787,1,1,0,5,41
Data Scientist‚Äôs toolkit ‚Äî How to gather data from different sources,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-toolkit-how-to-gather-data-from-different-sources-1b92067556b3,Samarth Agrawal,455,6,804,"Not so long ago!Do you remember the time when data was sent to you in an external hard drive for your analysis or model building.Now ‚Äî as a data scientist, you are not limited to those means. There are several ways of storing data, sharing data as well as different sources to acquire data, augment data.Below, I‚Äôm listing down several ways of gathering data for your analysisIn Python, a file is characterized as either text or binary, and the difference between the two is importantText files are structured as sequence of lines. Each line is terminated with a special character called EOL or End of line character. There are several types but most common are \n or ,A Binary file type is basically any type of file that‚Äôs not a text file. Because of their nature, binary file can only be processed by an application that know or understand the file‚Äôs structure1. CSV FileMost common format for storing and sharing dataset is comma separated format or a csv file. pandas.read_csv() is THE most useful and powerful method and I strongly recommend you to read its documentation . By using appropriate kind of sep you can load several types of data in dataframe2. Flat Filebut at times you might receive file that‚Äôs tab separated or a fixed width format or semi-colon separated etc. Pandas offer a variety of methods to read such data appropriately. But even read_csv works very well when you specify the right separator3. Text FileWe saw that using pandas.read_csv() method we can read in txt file but let‚Äôs look at Another way of reading a txt file is Context Managers. They are very effective in allocating and managing resources, closing all the files that are openThe most widely used example of context managers is the with statement4. Zip FileAt times, you might be given a csv file which in turn may contain the csv file you need in order to conserve size. To extract .zip file from python you need to use ‚Äòzipfile‚Äô library. If you are using windows doing this will be a far better approach than extracting it from windowszipfile is also a Context Manager and will support the with statement as we have seen above5. Multiple Text FilesYou might come across a situation where your data is provided to you in the form of multiple text files. For ex, you are provided reviews of 1000 movie titles and instead of putting all into one they have put each individual review as one file and 1000 such text files are providedWe will use a library glob ‚Äî which makes opening files with similar path structures simple6. Download files from InternetIf you have to download a file kept on a server. You will have to use a library ‚Äî requests7. Web page (Web Scraping)Web scraping is a fancy way of extracting data from the web pages using code. Data that lives on the web pages is called HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language. It‚Äôs made up of these things called tags which gives the web page structure. <head>, <title>, <div>, <h1> ‚Ä¶.. etcBecause HTML code is just text, these tags and content within them can be extracted using a parser. For this we will use a library ‚Äî BeautifulSoupLet‚Äôs say we want to extract information about Avengers Endgame (2019) from IMDb and rotten tomatoes bothNote: Inspect element is your best friend here in finding the relevant tags and attributes for extracting the dataThis way we have collected information on Avengers Endgame from 2 different sources8. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)You can ofcourse extract information from webpage but a better way of accessing information is through an API.Wikipedia has several publicly open API, one of the popular one is Mediawiki. We will use python library wptools9. Text Files (Reading data line by line)Let‚Äôs say you have downloaded tweets data using twitter api ‚Äî tweepyAnd you have saved all the tweets in a text file ‚Äî tweets_json.txtYour objective now is to extract useful information from these tweets, save it in a dataframe and use it for further analysis. This is a combination of skills you learned in step 3 and 8Part 1 ‚Äî Let me show you how to get twitter data using tweepy.Part 2 ‚Äî Reading this tweets_json.txt to extract useful information10. RDBMS (SQL Database)A database is ‚Äú a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.‚Äù It facilitates storage, retrieval, modification and deletion of dataIn the context of data wrangling, databases and SQL come into play for storing data or gathering data:We will connect to SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, a database toolkit for pythonmovies.db will not show up in the jupyter notebook dashboard yet2. Store Pandas Dataframe in a databasemovies.db will now show in the jupyter notebook dashboard3. Read database table in a pandas dataframe",19/07/2019,0,13,17,12,1050,1574,1,5,0,7,191
Generating Startup names with Markov Chains,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-startup-names-with-markov-chains-2a33030a4ac0,Gustavo Zomer,102,7,1282,"The most interesting applications of Machine Learning are, without a doubt, the generative models.The idea of finding patterns in data and generating new content that at the same time is similar to your data, but unique in its own way, has always fascinated me.So I have decided to develop a simple text generator to create Startup names using Markov Chains.But first of all, a short introduction to Markov Chains üîóA Markov chain is a model of some random process that happens over time.Markov chains are called this way because they follow a rule called the Markov property. The Markov property says that whatever happens next in a process only depends on how it is right now (the state).For instance, consider the example of predicting the weather for the next day, using only the information about the current weather. By analysing some real data, we may find these conditions:This is modelled via the Markov Chain below, where each circle is a state and the numbers in the arrows represent the probabilities of changing from the current state.So if we want to make a prediction for tomorrow, we just need to verify the current state we are in (sunny or rainy) and use the transition probabilities to calculate which next state is more likely.An in-depth explanation of Markov Chains, with some cool animations, can be found here: http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/So, how can we apply this idea to generate text? Well, it's quite simple actually.Names or sentences are basically a sequence of characters and those sequences follow some patterns.For instance, if I asked you to give words that started with whe__, you would quickly come up with the words when, where, whenever, etc. While wheeziness is a perfectly valid word, it's less frequent considering the initial whe_. In other words, given the state whe, we will most likely change to the states when, where or whenever than to the state wheeziness.So how can we build a model that capture these probabilities given our data?For this, I'll show you how to build a simple Markov Chain using the words startup, statistic and artist. First of all, we will list all the states transitions for each tuple of 3 characters:Now, if you pay close attention to the states, you will notice that some of them are shared among different tuples. To better visualize that, let's create a dictionary where each entry is a state, and the values are the next states and its weights.Ta-da! That's our Markov Chain. Simple, isn't it? (PS: Technically, Markov Chains are defined with a transition matrix with probabilities, not weights. We could easily transform into a transition matrix, but for the problem we have in mind, this is a better way of visualizing it).Now, how can we generate new data with this?There are basically four steps, let's go through each one of them:Step 1: Start with some initial random stateYou could select any of the states as a starting position, however, you will most likely generate text that doesn't make any sense. For instance, rtu is a valid initial state, but you won't find a word in real life that starts with those letters (none that I can't think of it, at least)A better approach is to keep track of the starting states in another dictionary, and selecting the first state from there. In our case, the possible initial states are sta(as both startup and statistic start with sta) and art. For our example, let's select sta.Step 2: Select randomly one of its transition states, considering its weightsFor the tuple sta, you can go to tar or tat, both of them with the same probability (same weight). In a real case scenario, they would have different weights considering the distribution found in your dataset, but as we have just used three words, they have equal weights. Let's ""randomly"" select the tuple tar.Step 3: Append the new state to your generated textSo far, we have started with the state sta and transitioned to the state tar. So our current generated word is star.Step 4: Repeat step one using the new state, until a stop character is found, or until you are happy with your resultNow, for our current state tar, the only possible state is art, so our generated word become start.Now let's continue the algorithm in a faster way. From art, we can go to rti or rtu. Let's select rti. If you continue to apply the algorithm, you will quickly generate our new word: Startist, which is a mix of startup and artist.Even though the example is quite simple, it demonstrates the potential of Markov Chains.Now that we have ""implemented"" by hand a Markov Chain, let's do in Python using real data where you can get actual useful results.Let's start by importing some modules. We will only need two: pandas, to read CSV data, and random to (unsurprisingly) generate random numbers.As a dataset for our Startup name generator, we are going to use a 2015 dump from CrunchBase with around 18k companies.The dataset is not that big, but you will see that Markov Chains work pretty well even with a database much smaller than this.Reading our companies data is pretty straightforward: pandas read_csv function accepts a URL as a parameter and returns a data frame. We have also removed symbols and transformed the names to lower case.As we have discussed previously, the simplest way to model the data structure for a Markov Chain is a dictionary containing the states and transitions weights.If you run the above code, you will get this result:What does this mean? These are the list of next states and weights on the Markov Chain, considering that the current state is the tuple sta. The higher the next state weight, more likely its transition to it.For instance, if you take the first state tar, it has the largest weight on this state list. Intuitively, it makes sense, as it is probably capturing the occurrence of the word startup.Now we need to build a function that returns a random tuple from the chain considering its weights.Finally, here is where the magic happens: let's generate some new words.Let's go step by step in our generate function.Remember that we mentioned that is better to keep track of the initial tuples and selecting one of those as the initial state? That's exactly what we are doing here.This is where we are navigating through our Markov Chain, considering its probabilities. We are selecting a random weighted next state and appending the last character of this state to our result string. However, if the last character is a period, we stop our generation, as this is the ending of our chain.We could add additional rules such as generating words given a minimum or maximum length, but let's keep it simple for now.Finally, we join all of the generated characters together, and we do the last verification. As nothing prevents the Markov Chain from generating an already existing name, and as we are interested in creating new names, we will simply generate a new one if the generated name is already in our database.Here is a couple of examples from our Startup Name Generator‚Ñ¢¬Æ.Pretty cool, huh? üòéOne final idea, what if we generated Startup names specific for each industry? It would be awesome, don't you think?Let's do it, it will be extremely easy üôÉThe only thing we have to do is to build our Markov Chain considering only examples from the industry we are interested in.And here are our results:You can try yourself using this Google Colab link or downloading the source code directly from my GitHub.colab.research.google.comWhat are your thoughts?

A Recipe for using Open Source Machine Learning models,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/a-recipe-for-using-open-source-machine-learning-models-within-your-company-1aed833a59b5,Rohan Relan,327,10,2192,"Machine learning continues to produce state of the art (SOTA) results for an increasing variety of tasks and more companies are looking to ML to solve their problems. With the incredibly rapid pace of machine learning research, many of these SOTA models come from academic and research institutions which open source these models. Often, using one of these open source models to bootstrap your machine learning efforts within your company can be much more effective than building a model from scratch.However, these models are often released by researchers whose focus isn‚Äôt necessarily to enable easy use and modification of their models (though there are many exceptions). Using these open source models for your tasks can be quite difficult.In this post, my goal is to provide a recipe you can follow to evaluate and use open source ML models to solve your own tasks. These are the steps I‚Äôve used over and over again in my own work (as of this writing I have anaconda environments set up over 15 open source models). As my work is mostly using deep learning for vision and NLP, my focus here is specifically on using neural network-based models.Whether you‚Äôre trying to use machine learning to solve real problems within your company or experiment with some fun SOTA results at home, my hope is that after this post, you‚Äôll have a path to take an open source model and modify and use it to address your own task with your own dataset.The first step is figuring out what your particular task is called in the research literature so you can successfully search for it. This can initially be quite frustrating. For example, finding all the instances of a dog in a picture would be an ‚Äúobject detection‚Äù task. But if you want to know exactly which pixels in the picture correspond to dogs that‚Äôs called ‚Äúimage segmentation.‚ÄùThere are a few ways you can try to figure this out. First, if you happen to know any ML researchers or practitioners, definitely start there. Another option is to ask in r/machinelearning or r/learnmachinelearning. If none of these pan out, the next step is to google to the best of your ability. As you land on research papers you‚Äôll often see the name commonly associated with the task in the literature.Once you know what to search for, the next step is to find those open source models that best suit your task. There are a few resources that are helpful here:paperswithcode: A repository of papers and associated code, organized by task. This is a really good starting point, especially if it‚Äôs a well-known task.arxiv-sanity: Many open source models are associated with research papers. Most papers in machine learning are (fortunately!) openly published on arxiv. Searching arxiv for recent papers that solve for your task is another good place to start. Not all published papers here have code associated with them. If you find a paper you like, try searching for ‚Äú<paper name> github‚Äù to see if the code has been released.Kaggle: If there happens to be a Kaggle competition with a task similar to yours, this can be a great way to get high quality, state of the art models. Pay particularly close attention to winner blogs for past competitions, these often have great explanations and code. The little tricks that were used to win the competition can often be really valuable for your task as well.Dataset benchmarks: If there‚Äôs a benchmark dataset that‚Äôs similar to the task you‚Äôre working on, the leaderboard for that benchmark is a quick way to find papers with demonstrably SOTA results.Google: For standard/common tasks like image segmentation, searching for ‚Äúimage segmentation github‚Äù, ‚Äúimage segmentation pytorch‚Äù or ‚Äúimage segmentation tensorflow‚Äù will give you a lot of results.This can be intimidating because academic papers can be pretty inaccessible, even to experienced software engineers. But if you focus on the abstract, introduction, related work, results, and delay a lot of the deep details/math for later readings, you‚Äôll find you can get a lot out of the paper and a deeper understanding of the problem.Pay particularly close attention to the dataset(s) they use and the constraints of those datasets or their model. Often you‚Äôll find that the constraints may not be applicable to you and are fundamental to the model design. For example, classification models for imagenet expect there to be one and only one salient object in an image. If your images have zero, one or more objects to identify, those models are probably not directly applicable. This isn‚Äôt something you want to find out after investing the time needed to bring up the model.Also, follow some of the references, especially those you see in multiple papers! You‚Äôll regularly find that at least one of the references provides a very clear description of the problem and dramatically increases your understanding. Referenced papers may also end up being more useful and may have nicer code associated with them, so it‚Äôs worth doing a little digging here.Once you‚Äôve found a paper with open source code, make sure it‚Äôs usable. Specifically:Check the license: While a lot of code is released under liberal open source licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache etc), some of it isn‚Äôt. You may find the model has a non-commercial use only license, or no license at all. Depending on your use case and company, the code may or may not be usable for you.Check the framework: If you‚Äôre working with a particular framework (eg. Tensorflow, Pytorch) check the framework the model is built in. Most of the time you‚Äôre stuck with what you get, but sometimes there‚Äôs a reimplementation of the model in your preferred framework. A quick Google to check for this (eg. ‚Äú<paper name> pytorch‚Äù) can save you a lot of trouble.Check the language: Similarly, if the model is in Lua and you‚Äôre not a Lua developer, this can be really painful. See if there‚Äôs a reimplementation in the language of your choice (often Python, since in deep learning Python should be part of your repertoire), and if not you might be better off finding another model.Check the coding style: Researchers aren‚Äôt all software engineers so you can‚Äôt have as high a bar as for other open source projects, but if the code is a total mess you may want to look for another model.Once you‚Äôve found a model you think is a good fit, try to get the model running. The goal here is to run the training and inference loop for the model as-is, not to get it running on your specific dataset or to make any significant modifications. All you want to do is make sure that you have the right dependencies and that the model trains and runs as advertised. To that end:Create a conda environment for the model: You may be trying out multiple models, so create a conda environment (assuming Python) for each model (nvidia-docker is another option here, but personally I find it to be overkill).I‚Äôll often set up my environments like so: conda create -n <name of the github repo> python=<same version of python used by the repo>A quick way to figure out which version of python the repo is using is to look at the print statements. If there are no parens, it‚Äôs python 2.7, otherwise 3.6 should work.Install the libraries: I highly recommend starting off by installing the exact same version of the framework that the original code used to start. If the model says it works with pytorch>0.4.0, don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll work with pytorch 1.0. At this stage, you don‚Äôt want to be fixing those kinds of bugs, so start with pytorch=0.4.0. You can install a particular version of a framework (eg. pytorch) with the command conda install pytorch=0.4.0 -c pytorch . A lot of code won‚Äôt have a requirements.txt file, so it may take some sleuthing and iterating to figure out all the libraries you need to install.Get the original dataset and run the scripts: At this point, you should be able to download the original dataset and run the testing and training script. You‚Äôll probably have to fix some paths here and there and use the README and source to figure out the correct parameters. If a pre-trained model is available, start with the testing script and see if you‚Äôre getting similar results to the paper.Once you have the testing script running, try to get the training script up. You‚Äôll probably have to work through various exceptions and make slight modifications to get it to work. Ultimately your goal with the training script is to see the loss decreasing with each epoch.If it‚Äôs straightforward (ie. only requires changing some command-line flags), at this point you might try running training script on your own dataset. Otherwise, we‚Äôll do this in step 7.At this point, you‚Äôve confirmed that the model works and you have the right environment set up to be able to use it. Now you can dig in and start really playing with it. At this point, I recommend creating a Jupyter notebook, copy-pasting in the testing script, and then modifying till you can use it with a single item of data. For example, if you‚Äôre using an object detection model that finds dogs in an image, you want a notebook where you can pass it a picture and have it output the bounding boxes of the dogs.The goal here is to get a feel for the inputs and outputs, how they must be formatted and how exactly the model works, without having to deal with the additional complexity of training or munging your own data into the right formats. I recommend doing this in a Jupyter notebook because I find that being able to see the outputs along each step is really helpful in figuring it out.Now that you have some familiarity with the model and data, it‚Äôs time to try to create a training notebook. Similar to step 6, I start by copying and pasting in the training script, separating it into multiple cells, and then modifying it to fit my needs.If you‚Äôre already feeling comfortable with the model, you may want to go directly to modifying the training notebook so it works with your dataset. This may involve writing dataloaders that output the same format as the existing dataloaders in the model (or simply modifying those dataloaders). If you‚Äôre not yet comfortable enough to do that, start by just getting the training script to work as-is in the notebook and removing code that you don‚Äôt think is useful. Then work on getting it to work with your dataset.Keep in mind the goal here isn‚Äôt to modify the model, even if it‚Äôs not quite solving the exact task you want yet. It‚Äôs just to get the model working with your dataset.By this point, you should have a notebook that can train the model (including outputting appropriate metrics/visualizations) and a notebook where you can test new models you create. Now is a good time to start to dig in and make modifications to the model (adding features, additional outputs, variations etc) that make it work for your task and/or dataset. Hopefully having the starting point of an existing state of the art model saved you a lot of time and provides better results than what you might get starting from scratch.There‚Äôs obviously a lot happening in this step and you‚Äôd use all your existing model building strategies. However, below are some pointers that may be helpful specifically when building off of an existing model.Modify the dataset before modifying the model: It‚Äôs often easier to munge your data into the format the model expects rather than modifying the model. It‚Äôs easier to isolate problems and you‚Äôre likely to introduce fewer bugs. It‚Äôs surprising how far you can sometimes push a model just by changing the data.Reuse the pre-trained model as much as possible: If your model changes aren‚Äôt drastic, try to reuse the pre-trained model parameters. You may get faster results and the benefits of transfer learning. Even if you expand the model, you can often load the pre-trained parameters into the rest of the model (eg. use strict=False when loading the model in pytorch).Make incremental changes and regularly check the performance: One benefit of using an existing model is you have an idea of the performance you started with. By making incremental changes and checking the performance after each one, you‚Äôll immediately identify when you‚Äôve made a mistake or are going down a bad path.Ask for help: If you‚Äôre totally stuck, try reaching out to the author and asking for some pointers. I‚Äôve found they‚Äôre often willing to help, but remember they‚Äôre doing you a favor and please act accordingly.Depending on the license and how you‚Äôre distributing your model, you may be required to provide attribution to the developer of the original code. Even if it‚Äôs not required, it‚Äôs nice to do it anyway.And please contribute back if you can! If you come across bugs and fix them during your own development, submit a pull request. I‚Äôm sure well-written bug reports are welcome. Finally, if nothing else, sending a quick thank you to the author for their hard work is always appreciated.",19/07/2019,0,0,23,1,785,505,3,0,0,10,182
The proper way of handling mixed-type data. State-of-the-art distance metrics.,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-proper-way-of-handling-mixed-type-data-state-of-the-art-distance-metrics-505eda236400,Kacper Kubara,567,7,1324,"Fun fact: Scikit-Learn doesn‚Äôt have any distance metrics which can handle both categorical and continuous data! How can we then use clustering algorithms, e.g. k-NN, if we have a dataset with mixed-type variables?Update (27/07/19) ‚Äî The package has been released at PyPI as Distython. I have published an article to explain how it works.The big problem that I have faced during my summer internship in the IT Innovation Centre was the lack of existing implementations of distance metrics which could handle both mixed-type data and missing values. It has started my long search for algorithms which can satisfy those requirements. Several research papers later, I have discovered quite interesting distance metrics which can help to improve the accuracy of your machine learning model when dealing with mixed-type data, missing values, or both. I have implemented them in my spare time and published their code implementation on the Github so you can use it easily with Scikit-Learn. But how? I will explain that in this tutorial!What I love about Towards Data Science, is that it attracts many like-minded people who are passionate about AI and Data Science. That‚Äôs why I would like to connect with you on Linkedin! You can also leave any feedback and questions via my personal website.Before we start, I would like to recommend to look at this paper if you want to get a more in-depth understanding of the algorithms I will talk about. My main goal here is to provide you with an intuitive understanding of those algorithms so you can use my article as a quick reference sheet. You can find the practical part with a code at the end of the article. Let‚Äôs get started!But wait‚Ä¶ What are actually the distance metrics? The distance metrics measure the distance between two instances in the dataset. They measure the similarity between instances based on their features. For example, imagine patients of a certain hospital who have two attributes: height and age. Then, we can say that old and short patients of a certain hospital will be quite similar to each other, whereas a young and tall patient won‚Äôt be that much similar to an old and a short one.The distance metrics are just algorithms which can tell you what is the similarity between two instances based on their attributes. Some of the most popular distance metrics are Euclidean, Manhattan, Hamming, and Cosine distance. They are commonly used in clustering, for example in the Nearest Neighbors algorithm.Most of these popular distance metrics can handle only one type of variable. They fail quite badly if you use them with a dataset which contains mixed-type variables or missing values. Fortunately, researchers have been trying to address this problem and there are few interesting state-of-the-art algorithms to help you overcome this problem.HEOM can handle heterogeneous data, together with missing values. Simply speaking, it combines 3 different algorithms to handle each case.The HEOM looks at each attribute of the instance (x, and y) and depending on the type of data does following computations:Then, we obtain a result vector which stores the distance for each of the attributes. To compute the final result, the following equation can be used:Which is a sum of every single distance squared and it is stored in the result vector. There is no need to use a square root as it doesn‚Äôt change the similarity between two instances (i.e if a¬≤ > b¬≤ then this is also true: sqrt(a¬≤) > sqrt(b¬≤)) and reduces the overall amount of necessary computations.The algorithm implementation can be found in my Github repository here.This one doesn‚Äôt actually handle heterogeneous data directly, but some of the heterogeneous distance metrics are using it as a part of their algorithm. That‚Äôs why it is good to have an intuitive understanding of how it works. The maths here might be a bit more complicated, but the general concept of the algorithm is not that difficult. The equation is based upon a conditional probability. It is satisfied for a value x and y for a specific column(attribute) in the data.Where P a,x,c is a conditional probability that a value of x will occur given the column(attribute) a and the output class c. Then, we just take a difference of probabilities for x and y, raise that difference to the power of q, and repeat it for all output class. If you still find it confusing, please refer to this paper for a better understanding!The metric can only handle categorical data, so both features and outcome variables have to be categorical. Later on, you will see that some of the workarounds around this problem include discretizing linear features or using it as a part of a more complex algorithm.Similarly to HEOM, the metric handles each data type (categorical, numerical or missing) with a different algorithm. You can think of it as a combination of both HEOM and VDM. For continuous data, normalized distance is used which is basically a distance between two values divided by 4*variance. It is as for HEOM, but the only difference is the denominator (use of variance is a better choice because it handles outliers in the dataset). For categorical data, normalized VDM is used. The final distance looks as follows:And each of those 3 cases can be described with the following equation:According to the paper, normalized VDM has 3 different kinds: n1, n2, or n3. I won‚Äôt be going into much detail here ‚Äî it is outside of the scope of the article and it is not necessary to get a good, intuitive understanding of the algorithm. All you should know is that the authors of the paper claim that n2 is the most accurate one.We will be using that Github repository for the practical part. So far, I have implemented HEOM, and the VDM is under the development. Feel free to contribute to the project by creating a PR on the Github. It takes a lot of time to write those algorithms from scratch and to ensure that they are working correctly, so any help appreciated!To install the repository, please follow the instructions in the Readme file. It is just a matter of using a simple command git clone, and optionally pipenv install to install the necessary packages.Those metrics were designed in such a way that they can be directly applied to the Nearest Neighbor (and other clustering algorithms) class in Scikit-Learn. You can use it for your personal projects together with Scikit-Learn classes as long as they provide an interface to call a custom metric function.In the code above we import the necessary libraries and HEOM metric. We will be also using Boston House Prices dataset because it has both categorical and numerical features.Here, we import the data and define it as boston_data. The important part here is that we have to tell the HEOM metric what columns are categorical. nan_eqv is used here to tell HEOM how NaN is represented. An important thing to note: Nearest Neighbors can‚Äôt handle np.nan directly so we have to declare certain NaN equivalent.In the code section above, we introduce the missingness to the data (for the purpose of the example) and assign it as nan_eqv.Then, we define our heom_metric and provide the necessary arguments. It has to be defined before the NearestNeighbors because we have to provide a callable metric function from the heom_metric to neighbor instance. That‚Äôs all it takes to use HEOM with Scikit-Learn. It is quite simple, isn‚Äôt it? More about using custom distance metrics with Scikit-Learn can be found here.In the last step, we fit the model and return 5 nearest neighbors using HEOM as a distance metric function.That‚Äôs all it takes to handle the mixed-type datasets with heterogeneous distance metrics. I hope that you are now equipped with some new tools which can help you to build more accurate Machine Learning models and also that you feel more confident with handling missing data![1] D.

Deep Learning on a Budget,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-on-a-budget-d414c2e89132,Manu Sharma,6,9,1818,"There are many articles and courses dedicated to the latest ML/AI research aimed at training bigger models and achieving higher classification accuracy. This is great for research and academia and pushing the limits of what AI can do. However, these are not really tailored for poor student practitioners starting off with their first major AI projects or penny conscious entrepreneurs looking to build an MVP of their cool revolutionary idea.In this work I take a budgeted approach to model training and try to answer the question:What is the minimum, practical cost to complete a real world AI project?The problem that I chose for this was an Image Classification problem.This article captures the process I followed and key budgeting lessons learned from each step.The answer is roughly $300 ‚Üí This is the amount it takes to train a well performing Computer Vision model using cloud computing. Incidentally (or not) this is also the amount of credit that Google gives as incentive to get started on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) [1].The breakdown of the budget is given below. The two rightmost columns list the instances from AWS and GCP that are most amenable to this task. The cost is an average of the instances listed in these columns. At present there is not a lot separating the two cloud providers in terms of cost.Of course there can be some variation in all these steps depending on the complexity of the problem and size of data. But in my experience for most initial projects or MVPs the total cost would not vary by more than a factor of 2 in either direction.A detailed discussion of each phase follows below.When tackling a new dataset and ML problem the first thing to do is understand the data, or in the words of A. Karpathy ‚Äî ‚ÄúBecome ONE with the data.‚Äù[2]There is a huge variance in what practitioners do in this phase but there are a few common components:A>Understand the input format and develop some pipelines to play around with the data. I have seen that this step often takes more time than planned for when dealing with a new data set. However, if done well once, this will save a lot of time and effort throughout the project lifetime.B> Look at a few random images from each class While looking we are really trying to mentally answer questions like: What features could a CNN use to distinguish the output classes? What is the scale of these features? How varied is the lighting? How centered is the object in the image? ‚Äî The answers to these questions will determine our pre-processing pipeline and the model architecture.C> Get a handle of the distribution of training samples across classes. This will tell us how skewed or balanced our training data is. If the data is skewed, as is often and painfully the case in any real world application, we would have to take appropriate steps in the training/testing process.Budgeting TipThis phase can be time consuming and will involve some scripting/notebooking effort. Also, these steps often don‚Äôt benefit from GPUs or multi-core CPUs. On a budget, choose a light weight cloud instance for this phase. I try to mimic my macbook config for this ‚Äî 2 to 4 intel cores with a few hundred GB of SSD.The sample configurations from AWS/GCP listed in the summary table are priced between $0.10/hour to $0.20/hour with GCP being slightly more cost effective than AWS for a similar instance type. At ~ $0.10/hour, a day of usage costs around $1. This is the least expensive instance used in the project. Do the maximum amount of development here.The second step in the process is transfer learning i.e. ‚Äî finding the most related CV paper in literature and trying to adapt its network architecture for the task at hand.There are hundreds of network architectures for object classification and a few more are added on arXiv[3] every month. It is easy to get enticed to use the latest model touting the best accuracy on ImageNet. However, that might not be the best idea when on a budget ‚Ä¶. or even otherwise.In the figure below (borrowed and simplified from [4]), the classification accuracy of some well known models is plotted against their complexity. FLOPS here stands for number of Floating Point Operations and is indicative of the complexity of the model.More complex models takes longer to train as compared to models with lower complexity. The models to the extreme right of this figure usually take a few weeks to train on a single GPU instance, the models on the left can be trained in a few days.Budgeting TipIn any exploratory project there will be quite a few iterations to figure out the right hyper-parameters and fine-tuning the data pre-processing pipeline. Hence, it is highly desirable to have a model that can be trained and validated in a few hours.You might notice as you browse through literature that most network architectures come in a few variants with different degrees of complexity and performance. While working on a budget pick the simplest variant of these architectures.My goto network architectures for an Image Classification problem are: ‚Äî1> Inception-v22> ResNet-50These two architectures provide a great tradeoff between performance and complexity. Also, they are very popular models with good native implementations in all DL frameworks like TF and PyTorch. In addition, there are a great number of tutorials and blogs written about them that can help with quick on-boarding.Selecting the right set of hyper-parameters quickly and with less number of iterations is critical while working on a budget. Here are the top three hyper-parameters to focus on:A>Mini Batch Size: A mini-batch size should be large enough to keep the GPU fully utilized but no larger.B> Learning Rate: Selecting the optimum learning rate is in general a useful exercise. However, it becomes even more important while doing machine learning on a budget. A very low learning rate can waste precious time and dollars.C> Number of Trainable Layers & Input Image Size: During transfer learning, usually the initial layers of the network are frozen and gradient descent is applied only on the weights of the final few layers. The training time depends directly on the number of un-frozen weights. When the training data set is small, there is usually not a option to un-freeze many layers. However, when the training data set is large smartly changing the number of trainable layers can improve training time.Most networks today can work with different image sizes without any modification. This gives us a unique power to modify the input image size at different stages of training. Generally, we want to keep the image size small for faster processing while ensuring that the features needed for classification are clearly discernible.GPUs are the only sane way to train CNNs. All cloud services provide an array of GPU instance options. These instances vary by the number of GPUs and the capacity of each GPU. Figuring out the right GPU instance is one of the most critical decisions that impacts the time and dollar budget of the project.In this post, only single GPU instances are discussed ‚Äî will probably discuss multi-GPU instances in a separate post. Surprisingly, none of the cloud providers publish any data on the performance comparison of their various GPU instances. The best reference for this that I found was from a group at Stanford called Stanford DAWN. [5]From above, note that the ResNet164 takes around 10 hours to train on a single instance K80 GPU (K80 is the least expensive of GPU instance on AWS and GCP) and the cost of running the complete model is ~$10. For tuning most hyper-parameters we might run the model for about half as long.Given a problem the same size as CIFAR10 most experiments should complete in 5‚Äì10 hours on a K80 instance.Budget TipWith this cost structure, we should be able to run around 20 complete experiments in 20 X $10 = $200. In practice, we would run maybe 20 experiments that last a short amount of time ‚Äî maybe a 1‚Äì10 epochs and around 10 -15 experiments for a longer duration of time.Note that this is the best case time. In practice, there will be many times when the GPU is idle, there will be times when the code is modified or we are plotting results or debugging the model. This should add roughly a 20% overhead to the process.This is a topic often ignored in most Deep Learning courses. Everyone will tell Deep neural networks take a long time to train and that is true. However, it is good to know what to expect during the training process. Below are the training curves for some variations of ResNet from 4 different sources.A surprisingly observation is that all of the above training curves show exactly two elbows or big jumps in accuracy. Also note that two of the above training curves are on the CIFAR10 dataset while the other two are on the ImageNet1K dataset. Also, note that the performance jumps often occur after plateaus where it seems like the network has saturated and is not learning anything for 20‚Äì30 epochs!Budgeting TipThe long training times and step nature of learning curves leads to a conundrum when iterating on the model on a budget. The key to tackling this problem is the (unproven here) hypothesis that hyper-parameters which perform well on the first few epochs also seem to work well at higher epochs. This implies that for hyper-parameter tuning we can restrict ourselves to a small number of epochs, say 10‚Äì20. And we can then train for a large number of epochs (100 -200) when we have finalized on the hyper-parameters.There are a bunch of storage options available on AWS and GCP. AWS provides 30GB of EBS and 5GB of EFS storage for free. Additional storage is priced at $0.1/GB-month to $0.3/GB-month. GCP prices SSD storage at ~$0.17 /GB-month. For most initial applications a few hundred GBs of storage should suffice.If we are using different instances for data exploration and modeling it might be possible to use a common SSD volume across these phases. For details please refer to [11].For anyone starting a real world AI project in the cloud, the cost of infrastructure should be roughly in the range of a few hundred dollars.

Starbucks: Analyze-a-Coffee,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/starbucks-analyze-a-coffee-b4eef811aa4a,Saleh Alitr,29,13,1764,"Starbucks possesses a unique way of connecting with and rewarding its customers who purchase its products. Starbucks Rewards program allows the company to create a Loyalty Program where it awards loyal customers by offering incentives for buying products with special offers.Starbucks is a global coffee company selling coffee, tea, espresso drinks, bakery, and grab-and-go offerings in 75 countries. One of the company‚Äôs values is ‚ÄúCreating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.‚Äù Therefore, it utilizes many channels to market its products from social media to TV spots and ads. Starbucks executes its extraordinary marketing strategy by deploying a combination of marketing media channels, where it creates brand recognition. Starbucks does not only understand its products and customers, but also keeps up with how its customers use technology. Starbucks App enables customers to keep track of the available offers and happy hour deals at participating stores. It allows customers to earn and collect stars (collect two stars per $1) that can be redeemed in-store or via the app.‚ÄúWith nearly 100 million customers in our stores every week, we‚Äôre looking for more opportunities to engage directly and personally, providing them with special benefits and offers that are meaningful‚Äù ‚Äî Matt Ryan, executive vice president and chief strategy officer for Starbucks.Here, we are going to investigate and analysis three files that simulate how people make purchasing decisions and how promotional offers influence those decisions. A sneak of the final data after being cleaned and analyzed: the data contains information about 8 offers sent to 14,825 customers who made 26,226 transactions while completing at least one offer. Below are two examples of the types of offers Starbucks sends to its customers through the app to encourage them to purchase products and collect stars.Bonus: below, is an interactive sunburst chart that shows more details about the number of transactions made where customers received an offer, viewed that offer through one of the channels used, and then made a transaction and completed the offer before the end of the duration of that offer.The analysis and its findings are only observational and not the result of a formal study. General business questions are listed below to guide us through the analysis to develop a set of heuristics where the findings are not guaranteed to be optimal or rational. Here is my Github repository with all the needed codes.The purpose of the analysis is to examine how Starbucks‚Äô customers respond to an offer whether a BOGO or Discount is the offer. Not all customers have the same incentives to view an offer and then make a transaction to complete the offer. Many factors play an important role in impacting how customers make purchasing decisions; for instance, some customers prefer offers that allow them to collect more and more stars toward getting exclusive perks or even free products. Sometimes, customers at a particular age group, prefer an offer different than what another group prefers. Moreover, we should keep in mind that female customers may react to an offer is different than how male customers do. Many aspects can be investigated and analyzed to find answers to such questions. All of that would help Starbucks to target its customers, and then personalizes and customizes the offers it sends depending on who are the audience. Many questions can be asked; here is some of what we are going to investigate:1. What is the number of customers who received at least one offer? 2. Who usually spend more at Starbucks, female or male?3. For the customers who spend more; Who makes more income per year?4. How old are most of Starbucks customers with respect to gender?5. How much do customers spend at any time since the start of an offer?6. Can we find the most popular offer by an age group or a gender, then compare it to other offers, or even another age group?7. Which offer has made the most for Starbucks? Is there a difference between BOGO offers and Discount offers? If so, Do male customers react the same as female customers do for any of the two offer types?The datasets that we have and we are going to read, clean, and analyze:If you would like to look at the final findings without getting deep with the technical details, please skip to the Data Exploration section.Note: During the cleaning processes, some of the names of the variables and their order have been changed to make it easy when communicated.Many alterations and preparation were applied to the three files to get a final clean dataset contains all the information needed for each variable available from offer types to gender and age groups. The main points that have been addressed and fixed are:Before going through the data to find the heuristic findings, let‚Äôs sum up the important files that we are going to focus on in the exploration step, and then merge them to create a final, clean dataset for further analysis.Next, we will go through each sub dataset created from the final, clean dataset to answer the question posted earlier.Please notice that all charts are interactive as you can get more information when hovering over any part of a chart. Also, some charts have filters on the upper left corner where you can filter the plot by gender or offer id.The donut chart illustrates that female customers account for 41.30% and male customers account for 57.20% of the data overall whether they all completed an offer, made a transaction before the end of an offer or not. Also, customers who chose other as gender account only for 1.43%. Can we assume that having more male customers would indicate that they make more transactions amount than female customers do? Next, we will investigate the numbers even further.We can see that, on average, male customers earn less than female customers do in a year. In fact, female customers earn more than the average income per year for all gender types. While female customers make, on average, around 71k a year, male customers make, on average, around 61k.Here, the plot clarifies that, overall, the majority of our customers make between 50k and 75k. The average number of customer per income rate is 163 customers. Thus, while the minority are making more than 100k per year, some customers earn less than 50k and the other earn between 76k and 100k. Overall, we can see that most of the female customers make between 60k ‚Äî 75k, and most of the make customers earn 45k‚Äî 60k. Next, we will confirm the difference between female and male customers income rates.Here, we confirm the previous findings of the income distributions. The plot confirms that most customers for all gender types make between 40k and 60k. Most of the female customers make between 60k and 80k while most male customers make between 40k and 60k a year.The box plots describe a summary of the age distribution by gender. They show that, on average, female customers are older than male customers.Another look at the age distribution by gender. The box plots confirm that the majority of the customers for both genders are between 40 and 60 years old.The trend of the transactions made since a start of an offer shows that, on average, female customers paid more than male customers did at any time from the beginning of an offer up to 10 days. Back to our concern in the first chart; even though the number of male customers is higher, female customers paid more than male customers have paid. The only exception is transactions made after 228 hours from the start of an offer. On average, all customers paid an overall amount of $16.55 at any time since an offer has started. We can see female customers paid more than the average at any time! Whereas male customers most the time paid less than the average. Also, we can observe some peaks over time for both gender where they, on average, paid more than usual. That could be during the weekends or specific times during the day.The plot shows that the average amount spent on two offers at any time since the start of these offers. We can see that all customers, on average, have responded to and paid more for offer 5 almost always more than what they did for offer 7 at any time.As we can see here, offers 5 and 7 have the most total transaction amounts of paid by all customers who completed an offer and made at least one transaction: $194,632 and $149,296.9, respectively. Next, we will look at the top offer with respect to the offer type and gender.Offer 2 got the highest amount of money among the four BOGO offers with a total of $110113.8 paid by all customers. Overall, female customers paid more than male customers for any of BOGO offers. Both, Female and male customers paid the most for offer 2 and offer 1.Offer 5 got the highest amount of money among the four Discount offers with a total of $194632.34 paid by all customers. Overall, female customers paid more than male customers for any of Discount offers. Both, Female and male customers paid the most for offer 5 and offer 7.After the data has been cleaned even further during the previous cleaning processes, here is a comparison of the completion rates by gender for each offer. The completion percentages came from the number of customers who completed an offer to the customers who received that offer. The overall completion rates account for all customers; female, male, and other. Offer 5 is the most popular offer with 82% completion rate. And obviously, female customers‚Äô response rates to an offer are always more than male customers‚Äô rates. Both gender prefer offer 5 the most. However, while over 80% of female customers completed offers 3 and 4, an average of 55% of male customers completed those offers.The bar chart illustrates the numbers found earlier where we can see a clear difference between female customers‚Äô behavior toward offers and the male customers‚Äô behavior. Overall, offer 8 is the least popular offer, and offer 5 is the most popular offer for both gender. Offer 8 is the least popular offer for female customers and offer 3 is the least popular for male customers.The plot illustrates the completion rates for each offer by each age group for all customers, female and male. For example, at the age group 35 years old, offer 6 has the highest completion rate 82.61%. While the age group 25 years old prefer offer 5 the most with a completion rate of 77.55%.",18/07/2019,2,0,137,74,1043,292,21,8,0,1,52
How to Adjust DetectNet,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-adjust-detectnet-a9ad0452d27f,Maria Ramos,51,4,288,"DetectNet is an object detection architecture created by NVIDIA. It can be ran from NVIDIA‚Äôs Deep Learning graphical user interface, DIGITS, which allows you to quickly setup and start training classification, object detection, segmentation, and other types of models.There are two basic DetectNet prototxt files provided by NVIDIA:DetectNet‚Äôs original architecture is written in Caffe. I could not find much documentation on the architecture besides 2 blog posts present in NVIDIA‚Äôs website and few tutorials which (mostly) reiterate the blogs‚Äô content. I did find that a lot of information has been accumulated under one particular GitHub issue, issue #980 under the NVIDIA/DIGITS repository.Here are the highlights I collected from the GitHub issue:For multiclass object detection in which you want to detect more than 2 classes, you may change the 2-class DetectNet prototxt [5]. Lines dependent on the number of classes are:To summarize the above: (i) make sure all the images in your dataset are of the same size (if they are not, resize or pad them), (ii) if you are using a custom size dataset, there are various lines throughout the DetectNet prototxt file which you must modify, (iii) make sure the majority of bounding boxes in your data are within the size range of 50x50 and 400x400 pixels, (iv) if you want to change the stride to a smaller number, you must reduce layers in the network, and (v) you can adjust the DetectNet architecture for multiclass object detection by changing some numbers to the number of classes you want to identify and by adding additional lines and layers throughout the prototxt file.I recommend you read all the references mentioned below in order to get a good understanding of DetectNet and how to modify it for your problem.References:",19/07/2019,0,0,1,0,1050,700,1,4,0,35,7
The New Photography ‚Äî What is it?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-new-photography-what-is-it-268582e57a86,Ted Tuescher,75,8,737,"This three-part series about photography and imaging examines many of the recent technical and social developments. In part 1, we look at the 190-year history since photography‚Äôs invention, noting the rapid pace of change in the medium and sudden transition from film to digital and rise of The Smartphone.In this installment, part 2, we‚Äôll survey a number of recent technical developments in an effort to build a larger context for understanding new capabilities and consider what‚Äôs next.The terms Computer Vision and Computational Photography are often used interchangeably. Computer vision, however, is a broader discipline covering a range of digital capture and processing techniques. It refers to the ability of computers to understand imagery, often in a similar way as people. Commonly this is achieved by characterizing the content, color, tonal values, shape or edge data. But it can also apply to other metadata such as embedded location or time data. When very large sets of images are analyzed, patterns and insights are gained and subsequently applied to organizing, verifying or even modifying imagery.Computational photography is more specifically a discipline involving calculations, analysis, manipulation of imagery using algorithms rather than optical methods. We won‚Äôt fret over the distinction between the two disciplines here but rather consider the larger genre of computer vision.This isn‚Äôt necessarily a new area. Initial examples of computer vision have been with us for awhile in the likes of:We‚Äôve seen a raft of new developments in computer vision covering a range of use in photography and video. Recent examples include:The news has been rife with stories of fake imagery and videos, often involving some of the techniques mentioned above ‚Äî and it‚Äôs only beginning to mature. A basic understanding of the methodology is helpful to understand its capabilities and where it may lead. While it can be used to generate new, synthesized or fake imagery, it can also be used to recognize, categorize, track or creatively modify imagery as in the case of the popular Prisma app which uses a technique known as style transfer achieved through use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, these approaches, which are highly adaptive, are a big focus in the effort to create self-driving vehicles.Generally, achieving good results makes use of neural networks patterned after biological systems where stimuli roll up to higher levels creating more meaningful impulses. At a very elemental level neural networks are optimization methods that train a computer model by finding associations between data. Strong associations are given more importance, weak associations have less value. It‚Äôs a bit of a brute force method but computers being fast and tireless can crunch enormous amounts of data to reach surprisingly good results.These explanations represent the very tip of the iceberg with these technologies. Implementations are still rough around the edges but they are improving rapidly. Yet even with this limited understanding, it‚Äôs not hard to see how neural networks can be used to generate impressive, animated models of real people, especially celebrities as we‚Äôve heard many times in the news. For example, high definition video with 24 frames per second can be pulled from YouTube to train a network on how a specific person speaks and moves. These learnings can then be used to generate new or altered imagery such as this example where Jon Snow apologizes for GoT season 8.These methods are computationally very intensive. Faster processors and the availability of huge amounts of digital imagery that can be used for patterning have allowed the more sophisticated and open-sourced algorithms to proliferate at this time. Interestingly, despite the complexity of image data, ML/AI methodologies have progressed much further than they have with text, due largely to the objective nature of imagery. Words and text, on the other hand, can have varying interpretations based on context, personality, culture and other factors like irony which pose bigger challenges for machines to understand.The examples we covered above are far from comprehensive. Software and hardware companies continue their aggressive progress while many universities have added the subject to their curriculum and formed computer vision departments. It‚Äôs clear we‚Äôll continue to see an increase in the volume and quality of manipulated imagery. Further characterization of large image datasets will naturally bring insights and learnings along with some abuses.In the final installment of this series, we‚Äôll consider some of the social and ethical challenges with these technologies along with some thoughts on mitigation. We‚Äôll also look at what‚Äôs on the horizon.",18/07/2019,1,0,0,4,1050,651,1,3,0,28,70
Data Democratization,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/data-democratization-918416c0f0e0,Piu Mallick,55,4,773,"In today‚Äôs world, every business is bombarded with data from each and every angle possible. There always remains a constant pressure to use various insights we garner from the data to improvise on our business performance. Hence, the incredible amount of the usage of the processed data has surged the desire and demand for data-democratization. So, if you are wondering that the above mentioned term is totally new to you, let‚Äôs dive deep into it.Before grabbing some knowledge on data democratization, we need to understand what does democratization mean. We can define it as the introduction of a democratic system or democratic principles; on breaking down the term further we can elucidate it as the action of making something accessible to everyone.And as aptly named, data democratization is the process of making data accessible to everyone, which implies that there are no gatekeepers that create a bottleneck at the gateway to the data. It provides an ease to the people for a better understanding of the data to expedite the decision-making and uncover brilliant opportunities for an organization. The ultimate mission is to have anybody use the data anytime, as and when required, to make a major impact in decision-making with no barricade or roadblocks.Of late, data was ‚Äúretained‚Äù by the IT departments. Various business units such as marketing, sales, executives are always in need to data in order to make important business decisions. Needless to say that they always had to go through their respective IT departments to access the required data. This is the way it has been for a long time, few decades may be, and there are people out there who still believe that this is the way it should be.Should we be Liberal regarding data-sharing?Advocates of data democratization are in the belief that it should be obligatory to disperse information on all the working teams so as to gain a competitive edge. The more people with diverse expertise having the access to data, the more organization will benefit by identifying and taking actions on important and critical business insights. It is believed by many high and esteemed professionals that data democratization can be a game-changer to many organizations. When the data gets spread out all over across the organization, it empowers each and every level of the individual to use the data and participate for the contribution in decision-making.Or should we be Conservative regarding data-sharing?Yet many organizational individuals are still perplexed as to sharing the data to the non-technical employees could result in misinterpretation of the data which might result in making some bad business decisions. Additionally, the more users having access to data, the bigger is the data-security risk and thus resulting in more challenges to maintain the data integrity.Talking about the data, some data still exists in silos/warehouse/archive-mode; although several attempts have been made in recent years and the attempts are still in progress, but the reality cannot be denied that people from different departments are still finding it difficult to access the data and view it.There is another concern which cannot be denied ‚Äî a duplication of efforts across different teams which could lead to more cost and wastage of time and effort when compared to a centralized analysis group.For the sake of argument, it might be concluded that it is easy to preach one approach over the other, but the reality states that extremely conservative or liberal views rarely fit into the context of data democratization. The business leaders should carefully weigh the pros and cons of data democratization in determining which kind of approach benefits their organization the most.The business leaders should decide upon how much liberal or conservative they should be regarding their organization ‚Äî ultimately, it all comes down to their business or organizational success. But, they can always spread out the metadata (and retaining the raw data) within the organization individuals to gain meaningful and impactful insights and can retain the sensitive data within themselves.For example, if we speak about a particular health-care center which deals with diabetic patients, it is not permissible to share the personal details of the patients (and thereby acting as intruders to their privacy), but analysis can always be done the generic data and thus finding out the age group or the sex-ratio are being trapped under diabetics.I agree that sometimes the perception shared by the non-technical people or the people who are not data-literate might be misleading, but attempts can surely be made to add an extra layer of scrutiny on top of that, to avoid any kind of mistakes and ensure the organizational growth ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the business leaders are there for.",18/07/2019,1,0,8,6,1050,590,1,0,0,0,11
Influencer Marketing using Web Scraping,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/influencer-marketing-using-web-scraping-568ef4c072c3,Ashley Ng,223,7,1130,"Influencer marketing is not a foreign concept to us anymore. In the US retail business, there are only 33% of the retailers haven‚Äôt used or do not intend to use influencer marketing of any kind. However, it is a great way to lift your brand awareness through word-of-mouth advertising. The tricky part is how to find the right person and/or channel to promote your brand.If you Google for the biggest influencers on social media, you are running against a wall. Instead, you should start with your audience pool and then extend the connections. For example, obtaining your commenters‚Äô information and contacting them about news is a good way to find your influencers. The best way to get those candidates is through web scraping amongst your audience. A lot of businesses don‚Äôt have the budget for expensive tools like data integration. However, there are plenty of cheap alternatives out there for you to gather valuable information, and one of them is web scraping software.Web scraping is a technique to automate the process of data extraction. It involves the process of parsing a website, and collect the snippet of data for your needs. I am going to show you how to use a web scraping tool and make these data available for digital marketing. There is no programming skill required to conduct web scraping. The tool that I used is Octoparse, and I will explain why it yields incredible value for marketing professionals.According to Joshua, comments are the place where we can leverage to extend our marketing strategy. I am not saying we leave comments and clap hands for your commenters. When the user name of the commenters is clickable, it is possible to connect with them by extracting the profile information. Whenever we have a new piece of content, we reach out to these people. This way we turn commenters into evangelists. Besides, you can go a little more creative by snowballing this method and creating your evangelist‚Äôs pool to further your marketing process.Blindly sending messages to beg for tweets won‚Äôt work. A great start off is to use your audience pool. The idea is:To start, you need to connect two IFTTT Recipes with your Twitter and Google drive. Turn on these recipes: Track New Follower in Spreadsheet and Archive mentions of your Twitter username to a spreadsheet within your IFTTT account.These recipes do what their names indicate. They collect the user ID as well as the links of people who either mentioned or followed you and deliver the data to your spreadsheets.We need to find the influencer who could drive traffic to your website. To do this, we need to scrape theirÔºöYou can do all these with the Octoparse softwareÔºöFirst, set up a new task by importing the collected URLs.Second, Octoparse will generate a loop list of URLs once you importing the URL list. Select desired elements by clicking the element within a built-in browser. In this case, click ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù and choose ‚Äúextract the text of selected element from action tip.‚Äù You will see the extracted data appear in the data field.Third, repeat the above steps to get their bios, websites, and Twitter ID.Last, run the task.You should be able to get a sheet like this. You will see each follower/person who mentions you along with their information.Then, export the data to a spreadsheet. You filter out people who are not qualified based on the follower numbers and background.NOTE: It would be wrong if you abused this method. Please remember don‚Äôt spam or send irrelevant information. Their existence is a form of approval of your great work. Your respect for them is another way to respect your content!Youtube influencer marketing is the new black. It is a great way to increase brand awareness and conversions by word-of-mouth strategy. Influencers, therefore, are burgeoning. Find the right influencer is the key to a successful marketing campaign.‚Äú61% of marketers agree it‚Äôs challenging to find the best influencers for a campaign, suggesting this problem is far from resolved.‚ÄùHere are the metrics you need to pay attention:For example, promoting a new car brand XYZ. The best way to do this is through a car review channel. The idea is:The Octoparse scraping template is a pre-formatted module. It allows you to extract the data without any configuration. All you have to do is type in the keywords/target website.First, Open Octoparse and choose ‚ÄúTask Template‚ÄùThen, Choose ‚ÄúSocial Media‚Äù on the category bar. You will find the ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äù icon.Third, Click the YouTube icon. You will see what data this template can accomplish, and you can look at a sample output as well. If this is something you are interested in, you need to type in the keyword at the parameter. In this case, ‚Äúcar review.‚ÄùForth, click ‚Äúuse template‚Äù and select the way you would like to run the task (either through on-premise, on cloud or set schedule)You should be able to get a table like this:Yet, we still need to know the numbers of subscribers on each channel. To do this, copy this URL list of Youtube Channels. Create a new scraping task, and paste the list to the parameter box:You should be able to get a list of subscriber numbers for each Youtube Channels, copy the list to the excel we just created. This is a sample of scraped data: car review youtube videoes spreadsheet. Then you can filter out those not qualified, sort the data in descending order, reorganize the list based on your standard, and contact the names appeared on your list.This is just a small fraction of what web scraping could help with marketing. You can get even more creative with this. For example, you can extract Youtube video‚Äôs comments, Twitter posts, product comments, your competitor‚Äôs blog comments, and even Facebook Public Community posts and comments. The idea here is to replace monotonous manual work of copying and pasting with automated data extraction. One great thing about using Octoparse is that it has web scraping templates of all kinds. This would allow you to save a lot of time.Last thought, we all know how important content campaigns are for digital marketing. The problem, however, is we are ego-centric, and will easily trust the things we create. We use our gut-feeling as we write to expect to get the interests of our audience. Rather, a great trick with this is to go after popular content and write better content to outrank them. You can scrape the blog title/ranks/likes/comments, etc, and assemble nuggets to light sparkles.Web scraping is super powerful. However, legal backlashes circle back when you don‚Äôt use it wisely. I believe that the best way to enhance a skill is by practicing. I encourage you to replicate these tricks and get used to automating data extraction to get your big fish in the pond.Source:https://www.octoparse.com/blog/a-revolutionary-web-scraping-software-to-boost-your-businessmediakix.comhttps://www.emarketer.com/content/what-retailers-need-to-know-about-influencer-marketinghttps://ahrefs.com/blog/web-scraping-for-marketers/",18/07/2019,4,0,11,0,939,398,8,5,0,14,30
How 90% of Drivers Can be ‚ÄúAbove Average‚Äù or Why You Need to be Careful When Using Statistics,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-90-of-drivers-can-be-above-average-or-why-you-need-to-be-careful-when-talking-statistics-3df7be5cb116,Will Koehrsen,37000,5,847,"Most people see the headline ‚Äú90% of Drivers Consider Themselves Above Average‚Äù and think ‚Äúwow, other people are terrible at evaluating themselves objectively.‚Äù What you should think is ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt sound so implausible if we‚Äôre using the mean for average in a heavily negative-skewed distribution.‚ÄùAlthough a headline like this is often used to illustrate the illusion of superiority, (where people overestimate their competence) it also provides a useful lesson in clarifying your assertions when you talk statistics about data. In this particular case, we need to differentiate between the mean and median of a set of values. Depending on the question we ask, it is possible for 9/10 drivers to be above average. Here‚Äôs the data to prove it:The distinction is whether we use mean or median for ‚Äúaverage‚Äù driver skill. Using the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values, giving us 8.03 for this dataset. Since 9 of the 10 drivers have a skill rating greater than this, 90% of the drivers could be considered above average!The median, in contrast, is found by ordering the values from lowest to highest and selecting the value where half the data points are smaller and half are larger. Here it‚Äôs 8.65 with 5 drivers below and 5 above. By definition, 50% of drivers are below the median and 50% exceed the median. If the question is ‚Äúdo you consider yourself better than 50% of other drivers?‚Äù than 90+% of drivers cannot truthfully answer in the affirmative.(The median is a particular case of a percentile (also called a quantile), a value at which the given % of numbers are smaller. The median is the 50th quantile: 50% of numbers in a dataset are smaller. We could also find the 90th quantile, where 90% of values are smaller or the 10th quantile, where 10% of values are smaller. Percentiles are an intuitive way to describe a dataset.)This might appear to be a contrived example or a technicality, but data where the mean and median are not in agreement come up often in the real world. The mean is equal to the median when values are symmetrically distributed. However, real-world datasets almost always have a measure of skew, either positive or negative:In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. This occurs when a relatively few number of outliers on the upper end of the graph ‚Äúskew‚Äù it rightward, while the majority of the values are clustered at lower values. A real-world situation is personal income, where the mean income is significantly greater than the median income. The following plot shows the US income distribution in 2017 as 100 percentiles in a histogram.The exact numbers vary by source (this data is from here) but the overall pattern is clear: a few very high earners skew the graph towards the right (positive) raising the mean above the median. At a value of $55880, the mean is close to the 66th percentile. The interpretation is 66% of Americans make less than the average national income ‚Äî when the average is taken to be the mean! This phenomenon occurs in nearly every country.An example of a negatively skewed distribution is age at death. In this dataset, there are, unfortunately, some deaths at a relatively young age, lowering the mean and skewing the graph leftward (negatively).In the case of a negative skew, the median is greater than the mean. The result is that more people can be above the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù when the average is defined as mean. ‚ÄúMajority of people live longer than average‚Äù might be a strange headline, but if you choose your stats carefully, you can make it true.Most datasets involving human behavior exhibit some kind of skew. Stock market returns, income, social media followers, battle deaths, and sizes of cities are all highly skewed distributions. In Antifragile, Nassim Taleb describes this world of skewed outcomes as extremistan. We evolved in mediocristan, where all datasets are normally distributed, but our modern lives are now dominated by unequal distributions. Living in extremistan presents opportunities for incredible rewards, but these will only accrue to a very small number of people. It also means we have to be careful when talking about means and medians as the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù representation of a dataset.(Zip‚Äôs Law and other power laws also produce skewed distributions.)The point to remember is when you specify ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, you need to clarify whether you are talking about the mean or the median because it makes a difference. The world is not symmetrically distributed, and, therefore, we should not expect the mean and median of a distribution to be the same.Machine learning may get all the attention, but the really important parts of data science are those we use every day: basic statistics to help us understand the world. Being able to tell the difference between a mean and a median may seem mundane, but it‚Äôll be a lot more relevant to your daily life than knowing how to build a neural network.As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

Predicting How Expensive A Healthcare Provider is for the Government,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-how-expensive-a-healthcare-provider-is-for-the-government-9ef0cccf8a72,Tristan Bonds,34,11,2251,"As Metis Data Science Bootcamp students, we were tasked to build a linear regression model for our first individual project. Simple enough right? Just draw a line through data.Not so fast!As a healthcare professional, I was excited to use this algorithm to solve a problem in the medical field. But what I quickly found out was, before any modeling, a successful machine learning project starts with picking the right kind of data. Linear regression works best with continuous numerical data which excludes several sources of publicly available healthcare data. However, it turns out that Medicare payment data is a perfect fit.But why care about Medicare? Medicare is a government-funded health insurance program currently covering 44 million people, or 1 in 8 individuals in the U.S. (1). That carries with it some huge public health and financial implications for the government. As soon as you turn 65, you‚Äôre eligible for it with a few exceptions such as younger people with disabilities or those suffering from end stage renal disease. And this population is only getting bigger. In fact, the Census Bureau estimates that by 2030, the elderly population alone will nearly double to 78 million people or 1 in 5 Americans (2).On top of this, it seems likely that Medicare is going to be increasingly more important in the coming years due to its prevalence in political discussions around the country. If the United States were to adopt a single-payer system, such as the proposed Medicare-for-All, it would be essential for us to lower costs wherever possible, and the effective usage of data could help to achieve this.One way to do this would be to look at healthcare provider costs. You can follow along with my code on my GitHub repository; I‚Äôve organized it chronologically with this article for your convenience.After searching the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website, I was able to acquire the most recent provider payment data which had over 1 million rows, each corresponding to a healthcare organization or individual provider, and 70 features.But as expected, this data was quite a mess. So in order to glean the most reliable insight I could, I decided to narrow down what I was measuring to only individual providers in the U.S, excluding territories and military zones.I then replaced all missing values in columns with count or percentage data with zeroes. It is likely that if a provider doesn‚Äôt have patients with a certain disease, the field is just left blank; this means it should have been relatively safe to impute nulls without losing much fidelity.There was also some documentation provided for the meaning of each column name. I decided the target variable should be total_medicare_payment_amt, which is the total amount the government paid for all the provider‚Äôs services per patient after deductible and coinsurance amounts have been subtracted. Additionally, I removed all columns that were either unnecessary (like provider names) or that would lead to possible data leakage (like other price-based columns).Finally I was left with a little over 990,000 clean rows with 38 features. Let‚Äôs begin!Using the Statsmodels python library, I just threw all my data into the ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression to see how it would perform initially with no modifications.As previously mentioned, linear regression tries to find a linear relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable. Above, you can see the simplest univariate form with only one independent variable or feature. It uses the equation y = mx + b to find the best fit with the data; m is the slope coefficient and b is the y intercept.But obviously with 38 features, this linear regression problem is a lot more complex. In this case, there will be 38 ‚Äúmx‚Äù terms added together, with each m term corresponding to the size and direction of the effect that specific variable is having on the dependent variable. In geometric terms, we will be fitting a 38th dimensional hyperplane to 39th dimensional space (instead of a line). If you find a way to visualize this, let me know!Ok, so now we have some intuition for the model, but how do we determine how well the model is doing?The metric that is commonly used here is called the coefficient of determination or R-squared. Essentially, it is the percentage of variance of the target variable that is predicted by the features. We want an R-squared close to 1 which indicates that the model is very predictive.But let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into the actual formula of R-squared because it helps us to understand how we are evaluating the model. The most naive method we could use to predict Medicare costs would be to just guess the average cost. That is the green »≥ (called y-bar) in the the diagram above. This will be our baseline.But we can do a lot better than that by using linear regression or the red ≈∑ (called y-hat). Now we just find how off these two predictions are from the actual value and divide them by each other (SSE/SST). This will tell us the percentage of variance the model cannot explain. But what we really want to know is what percentage of variance this model does explain. Subtracting that value from 1 will get us there.And after running the initial model, the R-squared was 0.619. That means that our model only accounts for about 62% of the variation in the data. That‚Äôs not too good.But wait! Linear regression has many assumptions and it is important to check if our data is actually working for this model.Assumption #1: Is there a linear relationship between the target variable and the features?For illustration purposes, if we use the feature of total medicare cost, it‚Äôs not entirely clear. To rectify this situation, we could do some feature engineering. One option is to do a logarithmic transformation of both the feature and the target.Wow! That‚Äôs a dramatic improvement. Anyone can draw a line through that! As you can see, it is often the case that we need to transform the data in specific ways to make it conform to the assumptions of the model we are using.Note: Always remember to undo this transformation afterwards in order to return your value back to the original context. Because after all, what does the logarithm of Medicare costs even mean?Assumption #2: Are the target and the features normally distributed?In the above figure, the left plot shows the target variable before using a logarithmic transformation; as you can see, it is terribly right skewed. The right plot, on the other hand, shows how applying this transformation results in a remarkably normal distribution.Assumption #3: Is there little to no multicollinearity among the features?Multicollinearity is when the features are highly correlated with each other. Above, we see a heat map where the darker colors indicate strong positive correlations. Ideally, we would see only light colors everywhere else except the diagonal line across the middle, as obviously a variable will be perfectly correlated with itself.But in reality, we see darker colors popping up all over the place, which indicates we are violating this assumption. This can lead to imprecise regression coefficients or worse, changes in sign for the same features in different samples, which makes it difficult to reliably extract meaning out of those coefficients.The way to go about solving this is to remove features until there is no longer any collinearity. As will be discussed later, regularization techniques do this for you by zeroing out coefficients of some of the features that are collinear with each other.Assumption #4: Are the residuals correlated with themselves?An autocorrelation happens when the residuals for a specific feature are not independent from each other. This is considered bad because it indicates the model is not extracting all the information possible from the data, and thus, we see it in the residuals.This can be measured through the Durbin-Watson test. Values near 2 indicate no autocorrelation, while values near 0 or 4 indicate strong autocorrelations. Our initial model has a value of 1.998, indicating that the model is extracting as much information as possible and the assumption has been met.Assumption #5: Is the data homoskedastic?What we want to avoid here is heteroskedasticity, a big word with a simple explanation. This is when the variance of the residuals change across the range of values in a feature.As you can see in this hypothetical example, it is very clear that the variance gets wider as age increase. This is not good as it means that our model will get worse at making predictions the older someone gets. What we really want is a consistent predictability and variance across the entire range of values, known as homoskedasticity. In other words, the two dotted red lines would be parallel to each other.Here we see the predicted values versus the residuals for our model on the Medicare data. This doesn‚Äôt look good at all. There is a harsh cut off in the negative residuals (due to government cost always being greater than or equal to 0) and the variance is completely inconsistent across the range of values.But after applying the logarithmic transformation that we did before, the plot looks relatively homoskedastic now and we have met this assumption. Boom!So after checking the assumptions of all the features, I decided to apply a log transformation to 3 features and the target variable.Now, I put this newly transformed data back into the model and after training, it produced an R-squared of 0.92. Fantastic! This is a solid result as the new model can explain 30% more of the variance in the data versus the baseline model. This demonstrates how important it is to transform your data to meet the assumptions of the model you have chosen.But this was just an OLS model. We can apply the regularization techniques briefly mentioned before which should further strengthen our model. These add an extra term to the cost function, penalizing the model for complexity. This is a good idea because simpler models are typically better than complex ones as they tend to be less susceptible to overfitting.In other words, complex models tend to fit training data super well but perform poorly on unseen data. I switched over to the scikit-learn library to do this regularization, along with adding in more rigor to the process with a test-train split and cross validation.I experimented with both ridge and LASSO regression and did hyper parameter tuning of the alpha terms which determine how strong the regularization will be. Surprisingly, both models with optimized alphas performed basically exactly the same as the OLS model with an R-squared of 0.92, with ridge being insignificantly better than LASSO. This indicates that regularization did not significantly help the model.The LASSO coefficients support this finding as well. LASSO typically zeroes out any redundant features, leaving only a few remaining. In contrast, the best LASSO model only zeroed out 1 out of the 38 features. This is a surprising result, indicating that most features contribute to the predictability of the model and thus stronger regularization would only hurt the model‚Äôs performance.Speaking of coefficients, we can determine the importance of each feature by looking at the sign and magnitude of the coefficients. This allows us to provide valuable business insights to our stakeholders, in this case the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.From the top 10 features, I found it interesting that the fourth most important feature was the number of white patients a provider has. This is alarming as the model actually seems to care about race in some meaningful way.This could possibly be exposing an underlying fault of the system, indicating that the white population is over-represented and thus, makes up a significantly larger percentage of the Medicare cost in comparison to other races. Other research needs to be done to determine the root cause but it is very possible that lack of access for underserved populations may contribute to this.This is a powerful result and a example of the value that data science has for society. I was amazed to find that not only could I use this algorithm to improve a stakeholder‚Äôs bottom line but to also reveal social disparities. This is one of the main reasons I love data science; it can have immensely powerful effects on our society.Looking at the top most expensive specialties, surgery clearly stands out. And it makes sense; surgery is incredibly expensive. This means that the government would best spend their efforts reducing surgery costs in order to most significantly impact their bottom line.In terms of medical conditions, largely preventable chronic diseases take the cake. This finding is a double-edged sword and falls in line with what we already know. Sadly, it means that most of these Medicare patients are suffering from diseases that they didn‚Äôt ever have to suffer from if they had just had different lifestyle choices. From both a financial and an ethical perspective, this is absolutely terrible.But on a more positive note, this means that the government can save incredible amounts of money while also reducing immense amounts of suffering by beginning to focus on preventive lifestyle medicine instead of reactive treatments, such as surgery.Obviously, we didn‚Äôt need data science to tell us to eat better and move more. But this further supports what we all know is necessary for the well being of everyone in society.And in the process, we built a model to accurately predict how expensive a healthcare provider is for the government. Saving money and saving lives, what more could we ask for?",19/07/2019,0,1,9,4,896,679,13,0,0,13,459
Brand Marketing on Facebook using Statistical Analysis,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/brand-marketing-on-facebook-using-statistical-analysis-7ec4210999b0,Rohit Lokwani,29,11,1629,"Tips and tricks to promote brands and gain insights from dataSuppose, some day you think of starting a company. In this age and time, one of the most important things is the reach of your company. If the company is formed on certain products which are used by people in day-to-day life, then it is likely that you already have a lot of competitors in the market. Now, what matters is to beat the heat of the competition. So, the places where your company becomes accessible to people is not only the advertisement hoardings these days. It‚Äôs the social media where people keep scrolling through their news feed around three times a day. On average, an American spends 705 hours on social media every year. The chances of failing are negligible, and even if you do fail, you have nothing to lose.So, let‚Äôs assume your company is officially participating in brand marketing on Social Media. You‚Äôve set up a Facebook or Instagram page as the brand that is supposed to be marketed is a cosmetic brand ( Not a big fan of cosmetics but the dataset used is that of a cosmetic brand). You respond to customer questions, follow fans, post important news, and thank your advocates for their support. Beyond that, are you taking enough actions to monitor and analyze the results of your work? If you‚Äôre engaging in social media, then you should certainly measure those activities. Is there any better way of knowing it? It‚Äôs easier done than said, sounds ironical, huh ?Social media metrics are data and statistics that give you insights into your social media marketing performance. Some of these metrics are explained in the blog below.To suffice the purpose of this blog, we‚Äôll segment the metrics into four different categories:I‚Äôll be covering all the categories in general without going into the specific details for each. So, following are some of the metrics that you need to know to get a better understanding of the whole thing:Reach: The total number of distinct people or the users the post has reached.Impressions: The number of times a post was seen by the users. A post reached to n number of people can be seen by them m times individually. So, the total impressions become m*n. The number of times a post is displayed in your news feed, irrespective of the post being clicked. People may see multiple impressions of the same post. For example, someone might see a Page update in News Feed once, and then a second time if their friend shares it.Total number of page likes: Likes show your audience size on Facebook. Over time, that number should be growing. If you‚Äôre stuck with around the same number of likes for months, it means one of two things:  1) You‚Äôre losing the same number of Likes as you‚Äôre gaining. 2) New people aren‚Äôt following youEngagement: It means the number of times the users have performed an action on the post. Engagement is one of the most important Facebook metrics you can track. Subjectively, engagement is a sign that people actually like the content you‚Äôre sharing. But another reason engagement is so valuable is it may give your posts more exposure to your audience. This includes liking, commenting, sharing and people who‚Äôve viewed your video or clicked on your links and photos. And it also includes people who‚Äôve clicked on a commenter‚Äôs name, liked a comment, clicked on your Page name and even gave negative feedback by reporting your post.Consumptions: This metric is similar to Engagement but Consumption does not necessarily produce a story.Consumptions = Link Clicks + Photo Views + Video Plays + Other Clicks (some of which do generate stories)Total interactions: As we know, the main motive is to increase the number of people viewing the post and to increase the number of interactions (like, comment, share) with the post so that a story is created and it automatically appears to the viewer‚Äôs friends in their News Feed. The total interactions are calculated from the actions performed by Lifetime Post Engaged Users (Story is created) and Lifetime Post Consumers (Story not created). Do note these metrics, these will be used later.Total interactions= Likes + Comments + SharesType of Posts: There are four types of post on Facebook: Video, Photo, Status, Links. A general human tendency is to look at images, read and share them. Statuses are generally longer and people are reluctant to read it. So, the natural biasing is towards looking and reacting to Videos, Pictures followed by statuses.Last year (2018), Facebook admitted that it prioritizes video in its algorithm, with extra emphasis on live video. If you can create video content, you have a much better chance of getting to the top of news feeds. So, you‚Äôll see the later visualizations are a little biased towards Video Posts.Paid Likes: Number of people who have Liked your Page as a result of a Facebook Ad campaign.The Facebook page analytics provides data and statistics related to these metrics. So, what I have done is I have a dataset with the name Morto et al, which gave the metrics for advertisement of particular cosmetic anonymized brand on Facebook. The dataset has a total of 500 records which has 19 columns with such metric values defined. Now, coming back to next part of this blog is getting started with R programming.R is a statistical programming language. R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It includes machine learning algorithms, linear regression, time series, statistical inferences. There are various packages in R which make it easy to get the tasks in the data science domain done easily. For detailed information theoretically on R, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/index.htm to get help for syntax of R programming language.Going to the project wherein I plotted various data visualizations which will help any layman to make decisions as to what actually helps in bringing the advertisement close to the end user.Note: The following observations and data analysis was done by intuition and then some changes were done to get the best results out of it.With the help of multiple regression analysis, we get the coefficients for all the above metrics which will help us determine the importance of each metric, which helps in increasing our page likes.Why Multiple Regression? Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression into relationship between more than two variables. In simple linear relation we have one predictor and one response variable, but in multiple regression we have more than one predictor variable and one response variable.We create the regression model using the lm() function in R. The model determines the value of the coefficients using the input data. Next we can predict the value of the response variable for a given set of predictor variables using these coefficients.2. Prediction analysis:Here, using the coefficients obtained by multiple regression analysis are used to generate an equation wherein putting the values for the variables the equation predicts the number of likes depending on the type of post.3. Post weekday v/s total reach, Post weekday v/s Total Impressions:Here, I have plotted a line graph to show the relation, how a post weekday affects the total reach and impressions. Results show a post posted on weekday 3 gives the best results for reach, and the same post has the maximum number of impressions the following day. Makes sense, doesn‚Äôt it?4. Type of post v/s Total reach, Type of Post v/s Total ImpressionsHere, a bar chart is used to show the relation between the post type and reach, impressions. It helps in comparing the impact made by each of the post types. The results show that a ‚Äúvideo‚Äù could be a better option for promoting your brand over other post types.5. Total Interactions v/s Total reach, Total Interactions v/s Total ImpressionsUsing linear regression, a graph is plotted that shows the dependency of total interactions on total reach, impressions which in turn would actually allow many viewers to visit the page.6. Paid post v/s Total Reach:When you pay Facebook to promote a post, the total reach of the post is increased. So, in order to determine if a post is paid, we use a decision tree which shows that if the total reach > 10470, the post is a paid post. So, as per the current dataset if you have to make the post reach to around 10,000 people, you need to pay for it and Facebook ends up promoting it.7. How many users who have engaged with the post have already liked the page? I plotted the pie chart to show the distribution. The results show 70% people who engage with the post are the ones who have already liked the page. Now, this statistic helps to spread the post amongst their friends and also provokes them to like the post or maybe the page.8. Engaged Users, Consumptions as a ratio of Impressions:Till now, we have been focusing on the parameters which directly affect the total page likes. Now, the factors which indirectly affect the total page likes i.e. Engaged users, Consumers, Consumptions are taken into consideration. Here, the statistics are plotted on a pie chart, which help in determining the percentage of consumers, engaged users from the total reach and also the consumptions, engaged users from the total impressions for every type of post.This helps in showing whether a particular post type is suitable for increasing the number of interactions and promoting the post.Thus, above was the statistical data analysis done in R as an amateur to get a Hands-On Experience on a real-world dataset. So, next time you start marketing your brand, do it on Facebook and see it spread like wildfire. Also, do keep check on the metrics, they will help you grade your marketing skillsüòä",18/07/2019,1,8,27,2,538,477,15,2,0,8,216
"50 Years After the Moon Landing, What Is the Future of Space Exploration? [Infographic]",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/50-years-after-the-moon-landing-what-is-the-future-of-space-exploration-infographic-ae54c030d5cb,Payman Taei,8300,4,587,"This month, 50 years ago, the wildest science-fiction fantasies became reality when Neil Armstrong stepped off the Lunar Module ladder and left his iconic footprint on the moon‚Äôs surface.His infamous words, ‚Äúone small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,‚Äù reverberated across the globe, to an audience of over 530 million viewers .In a few weeks, the world will relive this historic event after half a century of continued space exploration and development.In honor of this groundbreaking achievement, we take a look back at the history of lunar landings, the future of space exploration and the role of private companies in the burgeoning space economy.Although Apollo 11‚Äôs mission to the moon is the most well-known, there were other successful unmanned missions undertaken before 1969.The Soviet Union‚Äôs Luna 2 was the first spacecraft to reach the lunar surface in 1959, while Luna 9 became the first spacecraft to soft-land on the moon in 1966.Four months later, NASA‚Äôs Surveyor 1 successfully soft-landed on the moon, followed by four more successful unmanned missions.After 14 years of a tension-filled space race between the Soviet Union and the United States, Apollo 11 successfully went to the moon and back-and set a precedent for generations to come.Following this, NASA sent six more missions to the moon, five of them successful. In 2013, China also successfully soft-landed on the moon in December 2013, 37 years after the Luna 24.In total, the United States has sent the most missions to the moon, 38 of them successful, closely followed by the former Soviet Union with 56 missions.The current US administration has ambitious plans for getting humans back on the moon by 2024 , four years earlier than what was initially on the timeline. The program, called Artemis, includes eight launches and a mini-station in lunar orbit by 2024.Meanwhile, Russia plans to send manned flights to the moon starting in 2025, with the end goal of setting up a lunar colony by 2040 .India hopes to become the fourth country to successfully soft-land on the moon this year, with a spacecraft scheduled to launch this month and land in September.The space race won‚Äôt just be dominated by the nations of the world. Private companies such as SpaceX also have their sights set on the moon, even if travel to Mars is one of their main objectives. While Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX plans to send a group of artists on a trip around the moon in 2023, Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin hopes to take astronauts to the lunar surface by 2024.With the rising costs of ambitious space exploration plans, such as travel to Mars, NASA is increasingly turning to private companies‚Äô deep pockets to fund such endeavors.Billionaires such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen are among those who are investing heavily in the commercial space sector.According to SpaceFund‚Äôs launch database , there are currently over 100 space transportation companies from all over the world. As you can see below, the majority are based in the US, followed by the UK and China.Many believe that private-public partnerships between NASA and companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are the future of space travel.In fact, commercial launch traffic into low-earth orbit has risen dramatically in the last decade:What do you think of the future of space travel? Will increased space exploration be advantageous in the long-term? Or will it simply distract from more pressing problems here on Earth? Let us know your thoughts below‚Ä¶The original version of this post first appeared on Visme‚Äôs Visual Learning Center.",19/07/2019,0,0,0,5,1050,1101,6,0,0,9,40
Testing your machine learning (ML) pipelines,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/testing-your-machine-learning-ml-pipelines-81f9c436727c,Kristina Georgieva,150,6,917,"When it comes to data products, a lot of the time there is a misconception that these cannot be put through automated testing. Although some parts of the pipeline can not go through traditional testing methodologies due to their experimental and stochastic nature, most of the pipeline can. In addition to this, the more unpredictable algorithms can be put through specialised validation processes.Let‚Äôs take a look at traditional testing methodologies and how we can apply these to our data/ML pipelines.Your standard simplified testing pyramid looks like this:This pyramid is a representation of the types of tests that you would write for an application. We start with a lot of Unit Tests, which test a single piece of functionality in isolation of others. Then we write Integration Tests which check whether bringing our isolated components together works as expected. Lastly we write UI or acceptance tests, which check that the application works as expected from the user‚Äôs perspective.When it comes to data products, the pyramid is not so different. We have more or less the same levels.Note that the UI tests would still take place for the product, but this blog post focuses on tests most relevant to the data pipeline.Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what each of these means in the context of Machine Learning, and with the help of some sci-fi authors.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a system for testing your thoughts against the universe, and seeing whether they match‚Äù Isaac Asimov.Most of the code in a data pipeline consists of a data cleaning process. Each of the functions used to do data cleaning has a clear goal. Let‚Äôs say, for example, that one of the features that we have chosen for out model is the change of a value between the previous and current day. Our code might look somewhat like this:Here we know that for a given input we expect a certain output, therefore, we can test this with the following code:For each piece of independent functionality, you would write a unit test, making sure that each part of the data transformation process has the expected effect on the data. For each piece of functionality you should also consider different scenarios (is there an if statement? then all conditionals should be tested). These would then be ran as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline on every commit.In addition to checking that the code does what is intended, unit tests also give us a hand when debugging a problem. By adding a test that reproduces a newly discovered bug, we can ensure that the bug is fixed when we think that is fixed, and we can ensure that the bug does not happen again.Lastly, these tests not only check that the code does what is intended, but also help us document the expectations that we had when creating the functionality.Because ‚ÄúThe unclouded eye was better, no matter what it saw.‚Äù Frank Herbert.These tests aim to determine whether modules that have been developed separately work as expected when brought together. In terms of a data pipeline, these can check that:So if we take the unit tested function above and we add the following two functions:Then we can test that combining the functions inside clean_data will yield the expected result with the following code:Now let‚Äôs say that the next thing we do is feed the above data to a logistic regression model.Although we don‚Äôt know the expectation, we can ensure that we always result in the same value. It is useful for us to test this integration to ensure that:We can ensure that the results are always the same by providing the same seed for the random generator. All major libraries allow you to set the seed (Tensorflow is a bit special, as it requires you to set the seed via numpy, so keep this in mind). The test could look as follows:There won‚Äôt be as many of these kinds of tests as unit tests, but they would still be part of your CI pipeline. You would use these to check the end to end functionality for a component and would therefore test more major scenarios.Why? ‚ÄúTo exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question.‚Äù Ursula K. Le Guin.Now that we have tested our code, we need to also test that the ML component is solving the problem that we are trying to solve. When we talk about product development, the raw results of an ML model (however accurate based on statistical methods) are almost never the desired end outputs. These results are usually combined with other business rules before consumed by a user or another application. For this reason, we need to validate that the model solves the user problem, and not only that the accuracy/f1-score/other statistical measure is high enough.How does this help us?This kind of validation should be ran periodically (either through the CI pipeline or a cron job), and its results should be made visible to the organisation. This ensures that progress in the data science components is visible to the organisation, and ensures that issues caused by changes or stale data are caught early.After all ‚ÄúMagic‚Äôs just science that we don‚Äôt understand yet‚Äù Arthur C. Clarke.ML components can be tested in various ways, bringing us the following advantages:So don‚Äôt be afraid, if you have the skillset to write the code, you have the skillset to write the test and gain all of the above advantages üôÇSo long and thanks for all the testing!Originally published at http://intothedepthsofdataengineering.wordpress.com on July 18, 2019.",18/07/2019,0,6,0,9,488,276,2,4,0,1,195
How to Ease the Pain of Working with Imbalanced Data,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-abrown004-how-to-ease-the-pain-of-working-with-imbalanced-data-a7f7601f18ba,Andrea Brown,135,5,1004,"You‚Äôve finally collected and cleaned your data and have even completed some exploratory data analysis (EDA). All that hard work has finally paid off ‚Äî time to start playing with models! However, you quickly realize that 99% of your binary labels are of the majority class while only 1% are of the minority class. Using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric, your models are classifying all predictions as the majority class and are still 99% accurate. You do a little Googling to find the right search terms for Stack Overflow, and then you sigh deeply as you read about the pains of working with imbalanced data‚Ä¶Fraud detection is commonly used as an example of imbalanced datasets. Maybe only 1 out of every 1,000 transactions is fraudulent, which means only 0.1% of labels are of the minority class. Disease data is also likely to be imbalanced. In environmental health, a typical threshold for an elevated risk of developing cancer is 1 in 10^6, or one in a million people. For my project, I was working with lawsuit data, and the companies that had been sued were minimal compared to the dataset as a whole. In summary, imbalanced data is exactly what it sounds like: the labels for the minority class are far and few between, making the accuracy metric somewhat useless for evaluating model results.Another key difference is to use alternative metrics to the traditional accuracy metric. Since I was primarily interested in identifying True Positives and avoiding False Negatives rather than maximizing accuracy, I used the area under the curve receiving operator characteristic (AUC ROC) metric. This TDS post has a great explanation of the AUC ROC metric. To summarize, AUC ROC = 0.5 essentially means the model is equivalent to a random guess and AUC ROC = 1 implies the model can perfectly differentiate between the minority and majority classes.I also relied on the confusion matrix to maximize the number of True Positives and False Positives and minimize the number of False Negatives. Since I was working with lawsuit data, I decided to consider a False Positive result as an indication of a high likelihood of being sued in the future. Therefore, False Positive results were also very important to me. I liked the code in this Kaggle kernel to visualize the confusion matrix.I also calculated the more traditional precision and recall metrics (equations below for quick reference) to compare different learning algorithms, and I added the less traditional miss rate (false positive rate) to the list of metrics to compare as well.Precision = TP / (TP + FP)Recall (True Positive Rate) = TP / (TP + FN)Miss Rate (False Positive Rate) = FN / (FN +TP)There are two primary classes of methodologies to working with imbalanced data: (1) at the algorithm level and (2) at the data level. I‚Äôll summarize the methods for each in the following sections.Considering solutions to an imbalanced dataset at the algorithm level requires an understanding of algorithms that enable cost-sensitive learning. In my case (and likely for disease and fraud detection as well), identifying True Positives was the primary goal of the model, even at the expense of selecting some False Positives. This is where cost-sensitive learning comes in handy. Cost-sensitive learning takes into account the different types of misclassification (False Positives & False Negatives).A classic logistic regression algorithm is a robust model for imbalanced datasets. The logistic regression algorithm includes a loss function that calculates the cost for misclassification. Using SciKit-Learn, the loss function can be manipulated with a penalty weight that includes either ‚ÄòL1‚Äô or ‚ÄòL2‚Äô Regularization depending on the solver used.In SciKit-Learn, the Support Vector Classifier includes a ‚Äòclass_weight‚Äô parameter that can be used to give more weight to the minority class. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô mode ‚Äúuses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data.‚Äù This paper further details developing a cost-sensitive SVM.SciKit-Learn includes a Complement Naive Bayes algorithm that is a cost-sensitive classifier that ‚Äúuses statistics from the complement of each class to compute the model‚Äôs weights.‚Äù Optimizing the model weights is an effective way of handling imbalanced datasets.Boosting algorithms are ideal for imbalanced datasets ‚Äúbecause higher weight is given to the minority class at each successive iteration.‚Äù For example, ‚ÄúAdaBoost iteratively builds an ensemble of weak learners by adjusting the weights of misclassified data during each iteration.‚ÄùSolving a class imbalance problem at the data level typically involves manipulating the existing data to force the dataset used to train the algorithm to be balanced. This method is called re-sampling, and typical re-sampling techniques include:Over-sampling involves balancing the dataset by creating synthetic data to increase the number of outcomes in the minority class. A common method for over-sampling is called the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), which uses k-nearest neighbors to create synthetic data.Taking this a step further, SMOTEBoost combines over-sampling with boosting. SMOTEBoost is ‚Äúan over-sampling method based on the SMOTE algorithm that injects the SMOTE method at each boosting iteration.‚ÄùUnder-sampling involves decreasing the data included in the majority class to balance the training dataset. Note that this decreases the size of the dataset. A common technique for under-sampling is random undersampling (RUS), which randomly and selects a subset of the majority class. This Medium post goes into more detail on the various under-sampling methods.RUSBoost combines under-sampling with boosting. Similar to SMOTEBoost, ‚ÄúRUSBoost achieves the same goal by performing random undersampling (RUS) at each boosting iteration instead of SMOTE.‚ÄùBagging is an example of an ensemble technique at the data level. Bagging involves ‚Äúbuilding multiple models (typically of the same type) from different subsamples of the training dataset.‚Äù Bagging can reduce variance and prevent overfitting in algorithms such as the Random Forest Decision Trees algorithm.For my dataset, the best approach was to use combine an ensemble method of boosting with over-sampling of the minority class (SMOTEBoost) and use the logistic regression algorithm to achieve an AUC ROC value of 0.81. With additional time spent on feature engineering, I could increase the AUC ROC value even more.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,14,519,409,2,1,0,16,51
Can Congress Help Keep AI Fair for Consumers?,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/can-congress-help-keep-ai-fair-for-consumers-a9f3e86ab25,Kent Twardock,1,8,1679,"How do firms ensure that AI systems are not having a disparate impact on vulnerable communities, and what safeguards should regulators and Congress put in place to protect consumers?To what extent should companies be required to audit these algorithms so that they don‚Äôt unfairly discriminate? Who should determine the standards for that?We need to ensure that AI does not create biases in lending toward discrimination.These aren‚Äôt questions from an academic discourse or the editorial pages. These were posed to the witnesses of a June 26 hearing before the US House Committee on Financial Services [1] ‚Äî by both Democrats and Republicans, representatives of Illinois, North Carolina, and Arkansas.It is a bipartisan sentiment that, left unchecked, AI can pose a risk to fairness in financial services. While the exact extent of this danger might be debated, governments in the US and abroad acknowledge the necessity and assert the right to regulate financial institutions for this purpose.The June 26 hearing was the first wake-up call for financial services: they need to be prepared to respond and comply with future legislation requiring transparency and fairness.In this post, we review the notable events of this hearing, and we explore how the US House is beginning to examine the risks and benefits of AI in financial services.On May 9 of this year, the chairwoman of the US House Committee on Financial Services, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), announced the creation of two task forces [2]: one on fintech, and one on AI.Generally, task forces convene to investigate a specific issue that might require a change in policy. These investigations may involve hearings that call forth experts to inform the task force.These two task forces overlap in jurisdiction, but the committee‚Äôs objectives implied some distinctions:And explicitly, Chairwoman Waters explained her overall interest in regulation:Make sure that responsible innovation is encouraged, and that regulators and the law are adapting to the changing landscape to best protect consumers, investors, and small businesses.The appointed chairman of the Task Force on AI, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL), extolled AI‚Äôs potential in a similar statement, but also cautioned,It is crucial that the application of AI to financial services contributes to an economy that is fair for all Americans.This first hearing did find ample AI applications in financial services. But it also concluded that these worried sentiments are neither misrepresentative of their constituents nor misplaced.In a humorous exchange later in the hearing, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) asks a witness, Dr. Bonnie Buchanan of the University of Surrey, to address the average American and explain AI in 25 words or less. It does not go well.DR. BUCHANANI would say it‚Äôs a group of technologies and processes that can look at determining general pattern recognition, universal approximation of relationships, and trying to detect patterns from noisy data or sensory perception.REP. GARCIAI think that probably confused them more.DR. BUCHANANOh, sorry.Beyond making jokes, Congresswoman Garcia has a point. AI is extraordinarily complex. Not only that, to many Americans it can be threatening. As Garcia later expresses, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs an idea that all these robots are going to take over all the jobs, and everybody‚Äôs going to get into our information.‚ÄùIn his opening statement, task force ranking member Congressman French Hill (R-AR) tries to preempt at least the first concern. He cites a World Economic Forum study [3] that the 75 million jobs lost because of AI will be more than offset by 130 million new jobs. But Americans are still anxious about AI development.In a June 2018 survey of 2,000 Americans [4] conducted by Oxford‚Äôs Center for the Governance of AI, researchers observedThis public apprehension about AI development is mirrored by concerns from the task force and experts. Personal privacy is mentioned nine times throughout the hearing, notably in Congressman Anthony Gonzalez‚Äôs (R-OH) broad question on ‚Äúbalancing innovation with empowering consumers with their data,‚Äù which the panel does not quite adequately address.But more often, the witnesses discuss fairness and how AI models could discriminate unnoticed. Most notably, Dr. Nicol Turner-Lee, a fellow at the the Brookings Institution, suggests implementing guardrails to prevent biased training data from ‚Äúreplicat[ing] and amplify[ing] stereotypes historically prescribed to people of color and other vulnerable populations.‚ÄùAnd she‚Äôs not alone. A separate April 2019 Brookings report [5] seconds this concern of an unfairness ‚Äúwhereby algorithms deny credit or increase interest rates using a host of variables that are fundamentally driven by historical discriminatory factors that remain embedded in society.‚ÄùSo if we‚Äôre so worried, why bother introducing the Pandora‚Äôs box of AI to financial services at all?AI‚Äôs potential benefits, according to Congressman Hill, are to ‚Äúgather enormous amounts of data, detect abnormalities, and solve complex problems.‚Äù In financial services, this means actually fairer and more accurate models for fraud, insurance, and underwriting. This can simultaneously improve bank profitability and extend services to the previously underbanked.Both Hill and Foster cite a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper [6] finding where in one case, algorithmic lending models discriminate 40% less than face-to-face lenders. Furthermore, Dr. Douglas Merrill, CEO of ZestFinance and expert witness, claims that customers using his company‚Äôs AI tools experience higher approval rates for credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans, each with no increase in defaults.Moreover, Hill frames his statement with an important point about how AI could reshape the industry: this advancement will work ‚Äúfor both disruptive innovators and for our incumbent financial players.‚Äù At first this might seem counterintuitive.‚ÄúDisruptive innovators,‚Äù more agile and hindered less by legacy processes, can have an advantage in implementing new technology. [7] But without the immense budgets and customer bases of ‚Äúincumbent financial players,‚Äù how can these disruptors succeed? And will incumbents, stuck in old ways, ever adopt AI?Mr. Jesse McWaters, financial innovation lead at the World Economic Forum and the final expert witness, addresses this apparent paradox, discussing what will ‚Äúredraw the map of what we consider the financial sector.‚Äù Third-party AI service providers ‚Äî from traditional banks to small fintech companies ‚Äî can ‚Äúhelp smaller community banks remain digitally relevant to their customers‚Äù and ‚Äúenable financial institutions to leapfrog forward.‚ÄùEnabling competitive markets, especially in concentrated industries like financial services, is an unadulterated benefit according to free market enthusiasts in Congress. However, ‚Äúredrawing the map‚Äù in this manner makes the financial sector larger and more complex. Congress will have to develop policy responding to not only more complex models, but also a more complex financial system.This system poses risks both to corporations, acting in the interest of shareholders, and to the government, acting in the interest of consumers.Businesses are already acting to avert potential losses from AI model failure and system complexity. A June 2019 Gartner report [8] predicts that 75% of large organizations will hire AI behavioral forensic experts to reduce brand and reputation risk by 2023.However, governments recognize that business-led initiatives, if motivated to protect company brand and profits, may only go so far. For a government to protect consumers, investors, and small businesses (the relevant parties according to Chairwoman Waters), a gap may still remain.As governments explore how to fill this gap, they are establishing principles that will underpin future guidance and regulation. The themes are consistent across governing bodies:In the US, President Donald Trump signed an executive order [9] in February 2019 ‚Äúto Maintain American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,‚Äù directing federal agencies to, among other goals, ‚Äú foster public trust in AI systems by establishing guidance for AI development and use. ‚Äú The Republican White House and Democratic House of Representatives seem to clash at every turn, but they align here.The EU is also establishing a regulatory framework for ensuring trustworthy AI. Likewise included among the seven requirements in their latest communication from April 2019 [10]: privacy, transparency, and fairness.And June‚Äôs G20 summit [11] drew upon similar ideas to create their own set of principles, including fairness and transparency, but also adding explainability.These governing bodies are in a fact-finding stage, establishing principles and learning what they are up against before guiding policy. In the words of Chairman Foster, the task force must understand ‚Äúhow this technology will shape the questions that policymakers will have to grapple with in the coming years.‚ÄùAn hour before Congresswoman Garcia‚Äôs amusing challenge, Dr. Buchanan reflected upon a couple common themes of concern.Policymakers need to be concerned about the explainability of artificial intelligence models. And we should avoid black-box modeling where humans cannot determine the underlying process or outcomes of the machine learning or deep learning algorithms.But through this statement, she suggests a solution: make these AI models explainable. If humans can indeed understand the inputs, process, and outputs of a model, we can trust our AI. Then throughout AI applications in financial services, we can promote fairness for all Americans.[1] United States House Committee of Financial Services. ‚ÄúPerspectives on Artificial Intelligence: Where We Are and the Next Frontier in Financial Services.‚Äù https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403824.

We had a different point of view. We understood what governments were doing with photo technologies even back then. The reality of the global influx of image sharing, with cameras everywhere, with the promised excitement of Google Glass ‚Äî all combined with emerging face recognition technology, we saw the future. That future is happening today and it is moving towards an increasingly dangerous path.Enter D-ID, short for De-Identification. Gil Perry, CEO, Sella Blondheim, COO and Eliran Kuta, CTO realized early on they needed to do something about the implications of facial recognition technology. A programmer by trade, Gil enrolled in computer science at the university six years ago. By that point, he and Sella had already done significant research on facial recognition and the options to protect photos and to store photos. They started building a solution so people could upload photos, use them online but the contents would be unrecognizable. At that time, no one ‚Äî companies nor investors ‚Äî were aware of face recognition technology.Facial recognition technology began as early as 1960. Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe, the purported father of facial recognition technology created the first semi-automated face recognition system known as the Rand Tablet. By the early 1970‚Äôs, Goldstein and Harmer and Lesk were able to increase facial recognition‚Äôs accuracy by identifying 21 markers such as hair colour and lip thickness. But it wasn‚Äôt until the early 1990‚Äôs when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) rolled out the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program to encourage innovation for specific use for intelligence, law enforcement and security. Gil explains,We understood that cameras were everywhere. On London Bridge, people are being captured over 300 times a day. Almost everyone has a smartphone, taking pictures, uploading them everywhere without really understanding the risks. So when you combine three factors: face recognition increasingly accurate, a market of photos and images everywhere, and the business storage of photos from customers, employees and visitors ‚Äî this amounts to a perfect storm. The realization is that privacy is gone. We have lost our basic human right to privacy. Anyone can track you, recognize you and consequently, steal your identity.Gil had developed a working prototype and approached one of the top experts in face recognition who had developed one of the first algorithms using Deep Learning. Through a series of encounters he amassed enough knowledge to understand how governments and businesses were using current technologies and Gil, Sella and Eliran decided to bring their solution to the world with the mission to restore privacy or at least stop this imminent future from happening.You‚Äôre not going to be able to walk the streets without anyone knowing who you are, who your children are, where are they going, who are their friends, and where they live. If we don‚Äôt do anything, this will be our future.Before long, Sella, Gil and Eliran incorporated D-ID. The date was January 2017. They pitched to VCs and enterprise and it fell on deaf ears. People saw them as paranoid. Their efforts to explain their research and their experience did not convince investors there was a market need. They were told facial recognition didn‚Äôt work. The team also realized the market was largely unaware of the dangers of facial recognition technology. They continue, undeterred, to pitch their story and their solution.This was a perfect time for us. Our backgrounds gave us unique personal pain points that put us on this path to do something about it. We believed in each other and we continued to develop our tech and make it stronger. No one was thinking the way we were and that was good for us. What kept us going? We just knew!And then regulation happened. On May 25, 2018 the European General Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR) launched, the first globally recognized set of laws that fundamentally sought to change data practices in Europe. Its tentacles were far-reaching and started influencing policy and privacy changes globally. The team knew that business would eventually feel its wrath. Under GDPR, facial images are considered sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). D-ID realized they would be able to fill the gap between regulation and the reality of wide-spread image sharing. D-ID planned to be the privacy-enhancing technology for photos and videos.D-ID uses advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to resynthesize any given photo in such a way that the photo looks similar and good enough to the human eye but looks different to facial recognition algorithms. Gil explains it is not the same photo. It looks like you but it‚Äôs actually different. Typical noise reduction filters won‚Äôt help to reduce the protection. However, by applying solutions such as GANS attacks (adversarial noise injection), the user also can upload the photo to social networks, print it, take a screenshot ‚Äî and it will remain protected.It is robust enough against reverse engineering attempts that may try to overcome the protection by training a new classifier to ignore D-ID changes.D-ID has recently developed another product. Instead of protecting the photo, their Anonymization product changes the face so it is visibly different than the original. While the identity is masked, what remains are important attributes including age, gender, ethnicity, emotion etc. Gil explains,Face recognition is everywhere. Companies are trying to understand our intentions, our emotions when we shop and when we connect with others. The reality is that we can‚Äôt stop profiling from happening. That is where the money is. Our identities are being used without our consent. However, if companies want to make their product better by aggregating data from millions of people, identity should not be a factor in this research. It is not necessary to go down to the individual level.In this market of Deep Fakes, used in impersonations on social networks and hoaxes on dating sites, not to mention the development of people who do not exist, Gil is clear D-ID‚Äôs intent is to protect people‚Äôs privacy. The risk, however, is for anyone to potentially leverage the technology to perpetuate this market.We don‚Äôt focus on protection against deep fakes. Our goal is to make our tech so robust no one can re-identify the photo. We are focused on protecting privacy. In tandem with regulation we aim to leverage our technology to preserve individual privacy. Internet giants are experiencing horrific privacy issues today because they were late to understand the implications of their decisions. They need to change their strategy towards privacy to gain the trust back from their users.D-ID is selling to privacy-sensitive organizations who hold large repositories of photos from employees, customers/patients or visitors and need to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR. This includes schools, healthcare, financial organizations, governments for compliance, KYC or physical badge or license identification.D-ID is also selling to B2B2C: companies who handle millions of consumer images, including device manufacturers, cloud providers/security providers and security providers. Photos can be immediately protected through their API. In the future, D-ID can also be installed on phones to protect user photos. Gil references Ntech labs and their now defunct application, Findface that allowed you to identify an individual by simply using photo search. D-ID seeks to render these types of applications useless. It is, as Gil contends, a question of market trust.Gil feels D-ID surpasses current competitor solutions. Competitors in the anonymization space use pixelization to distort the appearance of the photo to the extent that final image is unusable. Parrot recognition is used to determine the degree of pixelization to re-identify the original image with some degree of accuracy. He insists these methods were not meant to protect from face recognition.Our view is that you should not have to hide. You do not have to wear glasses or hats to deter others from identifying you. You should be able to freely walk in plain sight while protecting your most sensitive information.To date, D-ID has raised $10MM, employs 5 PhDs, and the top deep learning and computer vision experts in Israel. D-ID‚Äôs advisors validate the technology and vision:Dr. Ann Cavoukian, three-term Information and Privacy Commissioner for the Canadian province of Ontario and the creator of the Privacy by Design framework:Faces have become our digital identifiers and as such they must be strongly protected. As more systems adopt facial recognition, the risk to privacy escalates dramatically. That‚Äôs why every organization that handles images ‚Äî corporations, governments, security agencies ‚Äî needs to act quickly and implement powerful security, deidentification and privacy measures. D-ID‚Äôs facial deidentification technology is specifically designed to make it difficult for AI to overcome and will serve to take individuals and organizations out of harm‚Äôs way.Rami Kalish, Managing General Partner and Co-Founder at Pitango Capital Venture:More and more data about every one of us is being generated at an alarming pace from a multitude of devices. Keeping our privacy safe from the risk that face recognition brings, requires a combination of decisive regulation and powerful technology. D-ID is one of the leaders on the technology side and their groundbreaking technology helps organizations ensure that the privacy of customers, employees and citizens remains safe.Organizations, as well as individuals are becoming more aware of how their information is used ‚Äî and misused. While user activity has abated on sites like Facebook, people, by nature, are social beasts. Companies and consumers will continue to communicate online, create, upload, share and store images and videos. D-ID is setting out to give them the security and peace of mind in the process.This post originally appeared on Forbes.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,12,1020,821,3,2,0,12,33
Response Formats and the Moon Landing,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/response-formats-and-the-moon-landing-9423747a2636,Anthony B. Masters,425,3,532,"In July 1969, the Apollo 11 spaceflight launched and landed humans on the Moon. Fifty years later, some people believe that the Moon landings did not really happen.This article looks at two recent survey estimates of the belief that the Moon landings were faked, and the differences between those two surveys.Back in February 2019, YouGov asked 2,039 British adults in its internet panel, for its podcast with Yahoo:To what extent, if at all, do you think the following statement is true or false?The moon landing was stagedPeople could answer along a scale from definitely true to definitely false, or that they don‚Äôt know. The survey estimated that 16% believe it is probably (12%) or definitely true (4%) that the moon landing was staged.A few weeks ago, Number Cruncher Politics ‚Äî which is not a British Polling Council member‚Äî asked 1,000 British adults about several conspiracies. Respondents could tick all that they believed were true.Previously, Number Cruncher Politics has used a mixture of internet panels and internet ‚Äòriver sampling‚Äô. River sampling involves inviting people to answer questions via promotional ads on selected websites.In the survey, only 5% ticked ‚ÄúThe moon landings between 1969 to 1972 were faked and humans have not really been to the moon‚Äù.So, which is it: 5% or 16%?There are some differences in wording, comparing ‚Äòfaked‚Äô and ‚Äòstaged‚Äô, and specifying the time of multiple Moon landings.However, the key difference is the response format.In YouGov‚Äôs survey, people had to select an option for each statement: definitely true, probably true, probably false, definitely false, or don‚Äôt know. This is called the forced-choice format.The Number Cruncher Politics survey was, as the article suggested, of the select-all-that-apply format. If you have taken surveys on the internet, you probably recognise this format. People are asked a question, and may tick multiple options from a list.There are advantages and disadvantages to each format.Select-all-that-apply questions are succinct, and often only take up one screen. Forced-choice questions take up more space, requiring greater effort from the respondent to scroll or click through to reach each question.However, select-all-that-apply questions require the person answering to think about all the options simultaneously. The forced-choice format encourages greater thought for each option.Problems afflict both formats: acquiescence bias may mean some people click ‚Äòtrue‚Äô (or ‚Äòagree‚Äô or ‚Äòyes‚Äô) options due to suggestibility or to just get through the survey. In select-all-that-apply questions, responding to satisfy the needs of the survey means people may only select some that apply.Pew Research Center undertook a randomised trial, where questions about personal experiences of negative events (such as having your identity stolen) were assigned in both formats.It was consistent across all questions that the forced-choice format yielded higher estimates that the select-all-that-apply approach. In the six options, the difference ranged from two points (asked to pay a bribe) to 16 points (being overcharged). The order was nearly identical between both formats.Whilst the select-all-that-apply format yields lower estimates than the forced-choice format, which is more accurate? A meta-analysis in 2014 by Callegaro, Murakami, Tepman and Henderson found few studies which dealt with this crucial question and were inconclusive.A change in response format can produce different estimates. Further survey research is needed to understand which format is more reliable.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,1,805,538,4,0,0,8,46
Saving and loading Pytorch models in Kaggle,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/saving-and-loading-pytorch-models-in-kaggle-3dadc0af1bd9,Perez Ogayo,131,4,483,"You have heard about Kaggle being awesome. You also are striving to improve your data science skills and are getting started with deep learning or just getting started on Kaggle.Just as you think you are getting the grasp of training your deep neural network on Kaggle, you get stuck.So you‚Äôve learnt you can save Pytorch models (strictly speaking, the state dictionary) and load them later at your convenience. You‚Äôve trained your model on Kaggle and saved it. When you need to access the saved model, you just can‚Äôt find it and this might force you to start all over again. üòìüòìüòìWe all know that training a model can be quite a painful process so having to do that all over again is not an option. Worry not, I(and Kaggle) got you!In this article, I will show you how to load your trained Pytorch model in 5 simple steps.I will assume that:The project I was working on and the subsequent need to author this article was born out of my participation in the Udacity Pytorch Challenge.Step 1: Train your modelIn this example, I wrote a function called train() that takes the number of epochs as a parameter.Step 2: Save your modelNote: The approach above (saving only the state dictionary) may not be the best as when you are loading, you will need to build a model with the same architecture as the one which you saved.Step 3: Commit your KernelSee below for what a complete commit looks like.You may have to wait for a few minutes for Kaggle servers to publish your saved file. You can then open your kernel and you will see your file under the output section as shown below.Step 4: Add your kernel as a datasetThat‚Äôs not the end. Go to the +dataset tab on the far right, and click it to add your kernel‚Äôs output file as data source.Your kernel is now listed as a data source. Printing the content of your input folder will list your kernel as one of the sources.See the image below for how to view and access your output files using code.To view your file on the sidebar, click Workspace -> input then you will see your kernel listed as one of the files under your kernel which is in the input directory.Step 5: Load your modelNow that you know how to access your saved checkpoint, you are ready to load you weights!Make sure the model that you build has the same architecture as the one whose state dictionary you save. There is a way to save both the architecture and the state dictionary in a single file so that you don‚Äôt have to remember, but that is not the focus of this tutorial.And that‚Äôs it!I hope this ->üòÉüòÉüòÉ is your mood after you‚Äôve successfully loaded your first model.

Selenium and SQL Combined- Top Premier League Players,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-and-sql-combined-top-premier-league-players-282b2a3fa413,Stephen Fordham,962,6,975,"The Premier League 2019/20 season is scheduled to begin on Saturday 10th August 2019. Whilst the anticipation grows for the new season, I thought I would investigate the best performers of the Season just gone.This tutorial piece will demonstrate how we can simply scrape data on the Top Performers of the 2018/19 season, and tabulate that data into a Database Management System (DMS), MySQL. The data gathered can then be queried using SQL.To begin this tutorial, the first objective is to find a suitable source with key statistics on the Top Premier league players. A quick search leads me to the ‚ÄòPremier League Top Scorers‚Äô page found on the BBC Football tab and shown below.Key statistical metrics I would like to gather data on for each player are: their respective name and team they compete for, goals scored and assists provided, their shot accuracy and finally their minutes per goal ratio.To begin, I need to find a wrapper that contains all the statistics for each player I am keen on scraping. I right-click in my chrome browser on the page of interest, and hover over the web element that I am searching for. Clearly the wrapper, ‚Äòdiv.top-player-stats__item.top-player-stats__item‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno-image‚Äô contains all the information of interest (as highlighted in the image below).Before writing any Python code, a working habit I encourage is to switch across to the console tab in the developers tool and search for the elements of interest. This approach is considered best practice because we can visually inspect if we have found our elements of interest.To use this feature type 2 dollar signs, $$, then input the tag and identifier name in quotations within parentheses.Now the wrapper have been found, key information within that wrapper needs to be found so we can loop over the wrappers later and extract all the information of interest for each player.Shown below, I can clearly see that the player ‚ÄòMohamad Salah‚Äô is contained within a h2 tag with the class names specified after in blue text in both the browser and the elements tab.The Console Utilities API contains a collection of convenience functions for performing common tasks: selecting and inspecting DOM elements and displaying data in readable format.As shown, here I perform some quick, but useful validations steps. I know from visually inspecting the page, that there should be 25 players, and indeed the length derived is in fact 25 by using the length function in the console!Further to this, lets confirm the names of the players are correct. I want to know if the first element in this 25 elements list is ‚ÄòMohamad Salah‚Äô, so I simply use the console text function and everything seems to be workings as intended.Finally, lets confirm that the last player in the list is in fact ‚ÄòLeroy Sane‚Äô I index my search query with the 25th element ([24], owing to Python‚Äôs zeroth counting index system), and scroll to the bottom of the web page. Indeed ‚ÄòLeroy Sane‚Äô is the last Player in the list.I repeat this process for every piece of data I would like to scrape from this web page, such as the team, goals, assists, and goal ratio.To extract, tabulate and transfer to an SQL database, I first need to import the selenium webdriver, the pandas library and the sqlalchemy module.The create_engine function from the sqlalchemy module enables interfacing with the database. A connection string is provided, to tell the engine object that we are connecting to the MySQL database.I then create a webdriver object and assign it to the variable browser, and navigate to the BBC page using the get method on the browser object.I find all the players and their data by using the find_elements_by_css_selector method and input the wrapper found earlier in parentheses. I assign that list to the variable, sensibly called players.One of the great advantages of validating elements in the console tab, in the developers tool, is that they can be directly copied and pasted into the ‚Äòfind_element(s)_by_css selector methods, they are valid queries!I can now iterate through the players list, and extract key information like goals ect. These can then be appended to a appropriate list. To confirm everything has worked correctly I print out the lists, and strip any text I do not want.For example, I want to treat ‚Äò 140 mins per goal‚Äô as a number later on in my SQL database, so I make sure to trim any padding and ‚Äòmins per goal‚Äô. Finally, although not strictly necessary, I quit the browser, so the pages do not build up, when I check my lists on each iteration.To finish, I create a DataFrame by zipping my lists together, and assigning them to sensibly named columns. I then connect to MySQL by filling out the parameters shown in the GitHub gist below.I need a table to exist in the underlying database to insert my newly created DataFrame, df into. I write a query in it‚Äôs native SQL language to create a table and assign a datatype for each column.The query is then executed (the table in MySQL has now been made). Now, all that is left to do, is use the .to_sql method, and insert my DataFrame (df), into the new table called top_players.A refresh of the schemas icon reveals that the top_players table has been created. A simple SQL query extracting all the columns from the table shows the selenium-scraped data now resides in an SQL table.Finally, lets perform an informative query. It would be of interest to know, which players had both a shot accuracy above 60% and a minutes per goal ratio less than 185. Filtering using the WHERE clause returns the players who fulfill these criteria.This tutorial piece has demonstrated how selenium can be used to scrape data, which can then be tabulated into a DataFrame, before being transferred across to an SQL database such as MySQL.",19/07/2019,0,0,2,4,1050,575,8,0,0,2,35

What about the patient experience?,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/what-about-the-patient-experience-aba3bfc4e908,Chris Kiess,6000,13,3074,"The surgery was scheduled, much to our chagrin, at 6:30 am on a Wednesday. This would require us to be up and moving out the door by 5:30 am, adding to what would already be a stressful day. What added insult to injury was we didn‚Äôt know this until the afternoon of the previous day despite the surgery having been scheduled at least one month prior. We‚Äòd been given the date of the surgery, but not the time (until the 11th hour).An interesting call came in about three days prior to the surgery (at which point we still did not know when the actual surgery would be performed). A gentleman from the hospital network had called regarding compensation. He informed us of the total cost of the procedure, how much our insurance would cover and what our balance would be. He also made it clear we should be prepared to pay the balance upon admission for the procedure.The curious thing about this was the surgery cost was in excess of 70k and our balance was a paltry three-hundred dollars and some change. It seemed odd for a hospital system making more than 70k on a surgery to place such emphasis on a mere three-hundred dollars. It seemed especially callous to receive this call before we had even been given an exact time for the surgery to be performed. It felt like being asked to pay in advance at a fancy restaurant.Leading up to the day of the surgery, there was pre-admission testing to be done at a separate location and requiring additional forms to be filled out by us. There was pre-admission paperwork for the surgery to be filled out by us and sent back. In all of the back-and-forth with papers and forms being sent to and fro, we never were given precise directions as to where we should go once we arrived at the hospital. We never received paperwork telling us what we should expect. There was no phone call to ask if we had any questions ‚Äî just a call to let us know about the bill we‚Äôd need to pay upfront.Upon our arrival at the hospital the morning of the surgery, all of that pre-admission paperwork we had filled out did not seem to speed our process as we answered many of the same questions over again during registration. The lady who helped us did remember to ask for our credit card to cover the three-hundred dollars we would owe after the surgery had been completed. But a system glitch in their credit card processing system prevented her from executing the transaction.After we had handled all of the administrative tasks, we were given a card with a number on it. This number was randomly generated and meant to represent the patient anonymously. I was told, at any point during the day, I could use this number to view my wife‚Äôs status. Unfortunately, this system (while nice) was not ubiquitous in the hospital. The only place to view patient status was a single monitor located in the registration waiting lobby. I spent the majority of the day waiting in my wife‚Äôs room and would have to trek down to the lobby each time I wanted a status update.After a short wait, we were led to a patient room on the hospital unit for outpatient surgery. It was soon apparent that all of the questions we had answered in the paperwork, the same questions we had answered once again during registration, were not recorded in a readily accessible format for the nurses and physicians who began attending to us. They would each parade in and ask my wife if she had any allergies, if she had X, Y or Z conditions, her date of birth or routine medications she was taking. She must have answered the same questions on at least three different occasions that morning.Later that morning, with my wife in surgery, I noticed a patient whiteboard on the wall in the room. It had blank spaces for items such as date of birth, allergies, medications, a pain scale and conditions of note along with the attending physician and assigned nurse. None of the spaces were filled in and it looked as though the patient whiteboard had not been used recently given it was devoid of the smudgy erased areas typical of a well-used whiteboard.This was just one morning for one patient. I wouldn‚Äôt say the experience was a terrible one by any stretch of the imagination. It wasn‚Äôt memorable in either a positive or negative respect. There were some high points like how long the physician‚Äôs assistant spent answering our questions, the patience of the staff and the ability to view my wife‚Äôs status by taking a short stroll over the admissions lobby. But it mostly just a routine, ‚Äúmeh‚Äù experience I have become accustomed to in healthcare.I studied the entire experience that morning as I had this article idea tumbling around in my head. I mentally mapped our journey through the whole process and compared it with my previous experiences. The one factor I couldn‚Äôt get out of my mind was there didn‚Äôt seem to be any thought put into the patient experience. As a result, I left the hospital with ambivalence in my heart. That is, I couldn‚Äôt tell you the name of the hospital and, even if I could, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend their services one way or another. Even sadder, they probably don‚Äôt care.Being a designer in healthcare as long as I have, I find this quite disheartening. When considering my own projects, it has been rare for me to start with the patient experience and there have been many projects I have worked on where the patient experience isn‚Äôt anything more than an afterthought (if it is even considered). I spend a considerable amount of my life as a patient and an even greater amount of time designing in healthcare. In both of those aspects of my life, I have begun to ask the question: What about the patient experience?There are so many experiences, procedures or systemic processes in healthcare where this question isn‚Äôt even a remote consideration. The patient experience in most healthcare scenarios is left to chance. In most scenarios, the systemic needs of healthcare trump those of the patient. As a result, there is rarely a chance to ask the question: What about the patient experience?Perhaps the largest problem stems from the approach to design in healthcare. Most design in healthcare is not user-centric so much as it is egocentric. That is, healthcare design is centered around the needs of healthcare and making processes and systems better for healthcare. Healthcare design is rarely centered around the patient. But we design tools for doctors and nurses to carry out their work and that is user-centered design, right? Yes and no.I have designed a lot of products for doctors, nurses, audiologists, pharmacists and various technicians. They are users and their needs were considered at length. But the majority of those products were designed with those specific users in mind while virtually ignoring the patient. It isn‚Äôt that I never thought about the patient. I spent a lot of time thinking about the patient experience along with the healthcare professionals who would use the tool. Yet my ultimate output was a technology that didn‚Äôt necessarily serve the healthcare professional or the patient. The technologies I work on most often service the healthcare system or corporation I am working for.Take your average electronic health record (EHR). I have worked on quite a few different types. They are typically designed for increased efficiency, regulation and to maximize compensation under the guise of increasing patient safety. This is egocentric design ‚Äî design that is primarily beneficial to the healthcare system.The real irony here is that the EHR isn‚Äôt particularly usable or useful. If the EHR were designed with usability as a focal point, we wouldn‚Äôt have a high correlation between physician burnout and documentation. If the EHR were designed as a useful tool (or one designed with the patient as a focal point), my wife and I wouldn‚Äôt have had to fill out paperwork or answer redundant questions over and over when all of this information exists within that system.There was a time when we could accurately state the healthcare system was designed around the physician. They were the all-powerful gods at one point and in control of the systems within which they operated. That is no longer the case. The healthcare machine is so large it now controls physicians and the majority of design is focused on maximizing benefits for healthcare ‚Äî not the patient, doctor, nurse or technician.Unfortunately, this has led to a situation where your average patient ambivalently accepts the system as it is. It is like the DMV (or maybe Comcast) where you know ahead of time you are going to get shitty service, but have become accustomed to it and know there is not a damn thing you can do about it. This is what happens when you consistently set the bar so low.Healthcare is a strange animal because there is virtually no comparison factor. In terms of experience or service design, the crap that happens in healthcare would never happen in other industries. Consider real estate, for example. I filled out less paperwork to mortgage my last house than I fill out for a routine medical visit. But no one ever thinks about this. No patient ever questions the massive amount of medical forms they fill out each year.Consider waiting. I have written a lot about waiting. In any other industry, can you imagine waiting as much for a service or product as you do in healthcare (and that industry still remaining profitable)? It has become such a standard in healthcare, we often block two hours off on our schedule for an appointment where we get 20 minutes of a physician‚Äôs time. It‚Äôs normal, right?Patients have just become accustomed to ‚Äúmeh‚Äù service. With a bar this low, a candy dish full of free suckers is almost enough to compensate for the extra hour waiting, the rushed treatment and the bill you don‚Äôt understand.But what is a patient going to do? It‚Äôs not like when Uber pisses you off and you decide to use Lyft instead. Or if Target screws you on a return you just begin shopping at Walmart. In healthcare, you are not likely to get any better or worse service at the next hospital or physician‚Äôs office. They will be serving you in pretty much the same way everyone else does.Yes, there are review sites online one can refer to. But do you really want to find your next doctor or hospital on Yelp? And, would you be guaranteed to have better service? Can you trust those ratings? Sometimes we rate a physician or hospital at 5 stars simply because they see us on time. That‚Äôs what they are supposed to do. (This is also the result of setting the bar low.)The lack of transparency in healthcare removes any hope of having a comparison factor and leaves the patient swimming in a sea of incomprehensible information. Now, this situation does exist in other industries. For example, how did you really know those brakes needed changed the last time you took your car in? Are you sure that furnace really needed to be replaced versus repaired? I would contend these situations are similar but do not occur to the same extent as we experience in healthcare.Let‚Äôs suppose your knee starts hurting and you go to your doctor. They examine you, charge you for the visit and recommend you out for an MRI scan. You go to a location of their choosing, are seen again, scanned and make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. They review your test results (because patients usually cannot make heads or tails of these findings) and recommend surgery to repair a ligament. You get the surgery along with a mountain of bills. Some of it is covered by your insurance and some of it isn‚Äôt. Here is a prime example of multiple levels where transparency is considerably lacking.This lack of transparency is pervasive in healthcare and leads to an unfair advantage over the patient. It aids in creating an almost subservient relationship between the system and the patient. This can be seen in other areas of healthcare.A few months ago, I had my biannual appointment with my endocrinologist. I am a type 1 diabetic and though I manage my disease well through good diet and exercise, I still spend a lot of time as a patient in the healthcare system. Each time I check-in for my appointment, I am asked for my glucose meter. The attending nurse will download all of my data and use this to view my glucose trends. On the day of my most recent appointment, the nurse had me place my meter in a small box. She then handed me a sanitary wipe and asked me to wipe my meter down.Having worked several years designing solutions around handwashing and reducing hospital-acquired infections, I certainly understand why the nurse asked this. However, it could be construed as an insult to your average patient and it is a bit on the rude side. It has the potential to make a patient feel unsanitary or tainted in some way. A better option would be for the nurse to ‚Äúglove‚Äù and wipe the meter down herself away from the eyes of the patient. At the very least, she could have explained the rationale behind the request.I kindly complied with what the nurse asked of me that day, but remember feeling a bit put-off by the request. In retrospect, I think I was a little shocked a healthcare professional would ask something like this of a patient despite understanding why. I acquiesced because nurses and doctors hold a certain authority over me (as they do most patients). I felt a little bit less human as a result.When we break a scenario like this down, we can understand how little empowerment the healthcare system provides patients. We are truly at the mercy of the system when we have an illness or disorder. We are at the mercy of insurance companies who dictate where we can receive service. We are at the mercy of billing procedures in paying costs we don‚Äôt understand or have an adequate breakdown of. We are at the mercy of professionals who have a greater amount of knowledge than us and hold a certain authority over us as a result.We can improve the patient experience in healthcare through empowerment. We can give patients autonomy to make decisions and make them feel as though they are partners in their own care instead of making them feel like amoebas who mindlessly cede to authority and follow orders. We can make patients feel like customers ‚Äî as we would in any other industry.Is the patient really the customer in healthcare? Or are the big insurance providers the customers? Maybe, in some cases, big pharma is the customer. It‚Äôs never really clear who the customer is in healthcare and this poses some interesting scenarios.For example, those ads for hospital systems you see on billboards or TV are largely ineffective because your insurance company really dictates which system you choose. If they don‚Äôt cover one system or it is out of network, where is the average patient going to go? Unless it is some specialty center or an extreme disorder, most patients will settle on the most cost-effective solution.If the patient isn‚Äôt really the customer, then no one really cares if you wait longer, if you understand your bill, if the doctors or nurses are rude to you or if you generally have a blah experience, right? If there are no comparative or competitive factors in play, this doesn‚Äôt leave you with much of a choice for switching services, correct? Well, not so fast. The healthcare system has created an interesting problem not just for the patient but also for the individual hospital networks. It‚Äôs a problem where the playing field has been leveled in some sense. And, for the right enterprising hospital system (or physician‚Äôs office), it a problem that could work in everyone‚Äôs favor.The patient experience could become the product. It could become the differentiator. And a hospital system doesn‚Äôt have to be the Mayo Clinic to benefit from providing a superior experience.The perfect storm exists in healthcare right now and perhaps it has existed for quite some time. The healthcare system has spent the past century slowly working to design a system around its own needs. Of late, they have even begun to ignore the needs of their own constituency in the form of doctors and nurses. But most important, the needs of the patient have been ignored for far longer.The result of this has been the creation of a system where the bar is set as low as it possibly can be for the patient experience. It‚Äôs a system where there is no comparative value. There is no real competition. And there is very little design around empowering the patient in their healthcare journey. This is an antiquated system ripe for change and disruption.The current landscape of healthcare is one where the ideal environment exists for entrepreneurial forces to differentiate health delivery and services. This will largely occur within the existing system rather than take the form of some external product or service. Companies such as DirectPath and 98point6 are already working to change how we receive and approach services in healthcare. Organizations like Connect_CX are working to improve the patient experience in healthcare. I believe these organizations will continue to gain traction and will form a catalyst for change in an industry desperately in need of it.Yet I am skeptical as to whether this will be enough. I am unsure as to whether any of these efforts will lead to the widescale change needed. But they are moving in the right direction and small starts are often the best place to begin. These organizations are all addressing the issues and problems in healthcare today that adversely affect the patient experience.Placing design first and positioning the patient as the focal point of design efforts will, perhaps, create the greatest catalyst for change in healthcare. It will also begin to undermine the imbalances between the patient and health systems.And that is, perhaps, as good as any place to start.",18/07/2019,4,0,0,0,1050,590,1,1,0,6,165

The demise of traditional UX design,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/the-demise-of-traditional-ux-design-2a1809581311,Emma Birch,28,7,1513,"Change is inevitable. The discipline once known as ‚ÄòInteraction Designer‚Äô is morphing into roles such as ‚ÄòImmersive Technologies Designer‚Äô or ‚ÄòProduct Proposition Designer‚Äô. We are starting to see user experience evolve into something more niche and also more strategic. With new job prospects and business opportunities, we must continue to learn and adapt to our ever-changing environment so that we are not the next Kodak. So, what are the key challenges facing UX in this state of disruption and how might we better prepare for the future?Employing good UX design used to be a competitive advantage for companies that managed to do it well but today good UX is an expectation. In the past, when finding it challenging to navigate a website or mobile app, the user used to blame themselves. Now, they blame the company. This is supported by theories of Learned Helplessness where the individual, after repeated unsuccessful attempts to achieve a goal, gives up and often internally attributes the failure. Yet, as the design of technology has improved and more people were able to successfully accomplish their goal, the individual learned not to attribute the failure to themselves but rather to the company.Companies must therefore not only meet customer expectations but continue to find new ways to offer value above and beyond their competitors. Additional value can come from looking ahead at the industry being played in to see where new opportunities to innovate may lie.I work at Deloitte Digital and while we are extremely proficient at delivering large scale technical implementations for clients, we are always looking for new areas to innovate. We have acquired various companies such as Well Placed Cactus (a business that specialises in digital reality experiences) and Market Gravity (a business that specialises in proposition design consulting to produce innovative products) in order to be able to continuously cater towards the demands of our client‚Äôs customers.UX itself is an integral part of many of our projects but slowly it appears that the UX design role is becoming entwined with other skillsets. As teams of developers, business analysts, service designers and creatives better understand what constitutes a good user experience, more hybrid roles develop and delivering a useful, memorable, engaging experience becomes, to an extent, everyone‚Äôs responsibility. In order to avoid diffusion of our profession, it appears that UXers will need to either become more specialised or more strategic, which I will discuss later on.Furthermore, there is a growing proliferation of toolkits and software that make it easier to deliver a satisfactory user experience. Now we can follow Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and download Sketch templates from numerous sources online to quickly create an interface that is ‚Äòintuitive‚Äô; something that people easily recognise how to use.Because people are so familiar with the interfaces created by such players as Apple, Google, Microsoft or Facebook due to regular usage, it is often these big players paving the way forward in terms of defining what intuitive interfaces look like. An easy (note not always best) option, especially for the amateur UXer, is to copy. After all, how many different ways can you design something such as a form? There‚Äôs a traditional form, a conversational form, or a natural language form, but beyond that the options for designing a form for a graphical user interface become few and far between.What this means is that junior designers are able to become ‚Äògood designers‚Äô more quickly but still becoming a great designer is the challenge. The real skill is not in applying what has been done before but in thinking about how to design something new, better or different. It‚Äôs a scary realisation when your job role is the one becoming increasingly standardised or automated but this frees us up to focus on new areas such as designing conversations for voice or chatbots, further pushing design for immersive experiences, exploring new use cases for brain machine interfaces and creating data led visualisations through digital twins.Another challenge for the tech industry is hiring or, from an aspiring UXer point of view, is becoming employable. A study by Ernst & Young has revealed that students are increasingly graduating with high debts and poor job prospects. One reason for this is that traditional Universities are offering degrees that are becoming obsolete by the time the student graduates. The study of User Experience design has only gradually started to become integrated into degrees. Some universities offer courses in Human Computer Interaction, Information Architecture or Interactive Design, but each one of these disciplines only covers a subset of what UX does.Nevertheless, according to the EY report, it‚Äôs not about studying the degree that will line you up perfectly for the industry (in fact the majority of UX designers don‚Äôt have a relevant degree), it‚Äôs about being taught ways of thinking that will enable students to learn on the job and adapt to a changing workplace. As the report suggest, more than ever it‚Äôs therefore important for university graduates to remain relevant within an industry of constant flux:‚ÄúStudents need to be equipped with employability skills that are transferable across a broad range of job opportunities. In addition to hard technical skills, education curricular needs to be redesigned to polish individuals with thought leadership and complex problem-solving skills so they can modify their approaches as business dynamics transfigure‚ÄùIn order to do this it‚Äôs suggested that the undergraduate degree may be disrupted by ‚Äústackable‚Äù education and less conventional learning. Flexible, short online learning courses are increasingly popular and should start to be regarded as legitimate education by companies looking to hire.Not only are the findings important for students though, they‚Äôre important for professionals. Companies are increasingly partnering with education institutes to help their employees access relevant courses to address the need for reskilling and upskilling with flexible personalised course structures. This stackable informal education is increasingly popular as it allows lifelong learners multiple entry and exit options and allows people to continue to grow and learn throughout their career.With the UI design work becoming less time consuming to carry out, this means that UX designers are able to think more strategically. In the UX ‚Äògolden age‚Äô, the user was all important and creating amazing design came from intimately understanding your design target. However, today if we only consider the user and neglect to understand the business and the industry that business plays in, it is likely that the design will not hold up.The other risk factor is focusing only on production design. As a designer if you are, for instance, specialised in designing wireframes it is likely your job role is at greater risk of being replaced. Production roles are after all much easier to automate that strategic roles.As such, strategic UX roles start seeming like a better realm to play in. What‚Äôs involved? Well these roles require more focus on the business such as how this product fits into the businesses marketing, commercial and overall technical strategy and experience. While still employing a human centred design lens, we can start to think more creatively and strategically about the overall value of this proposition, not only to the customer but also to the business.What happens if you‚Äôre not into strategy? Well another option is to become more specialised. With a growing proliferation of new technologies such as voice assistants, brain machine interfaces, immersive technologies, 3D printing, drones and more, it‚Äôs near impossible to be an expert across all areas. It therefore may be worthwhile in deciding on an area in which to become an expert designer. Or if you‚Äôre a consultant, like myself, you could also consider picking an industry such as Finance, Travel, Education etc.There are great opportunities for designers who can position themselves well and be at the forefront of innovation in a new technological area. Consider becoming an expert in designing drones that you fly with your brain. You would need to understand the technology underpinning this such as the brain machine interface, likely an EEG headset, and how to make a person‚Äôs thoughts correspond with drone direction. When this becomes more accessible to the market, how do you create the onboarding process seamless for the user? How do you know what is intuitive for them if this is the first time they have used such technology? You could use similar design thinking principles and user testing techniques as you have always used but it will become important to be able to apply these skills to this new technology or situation.To conclude, adaptability is key to coming out on top in our ever-changing tech driven environment. Upskilling and pivoting to stay ahead of the market will become increasingly important for UX. We‚Äôre seeing disruption in Education and Industry to the point that individuals must consider new, different or better ways to add value. Rather than relying on institutions to provide us with the skills and experience necessary to advance, we will need to take more ownership of our careers by making decisions that enable learning and growth in new ways. In doing this we can progress forward to more creative and interesting opportunities.First published on https://www.enbdesign.studio",18/07/2019,3,0,1,1,1050,642,5,0,0,15,296
"Basics of memory, perception, and Gestalt principles",UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/the-basics-of-memory-perception-and-gestalt-principles-19360bf198e8,Tyler Nishida,167,4,608,"Have you ever been in an argument, waiting for the right moment to speak, and then forgot what you were going to say?This usually happens when I argue with my girlfriend (she‚Äôs undefeated), but regardless of when it happens, it‚Äôs always frustrating. The frustration we feel is the result of our minds being forced to activate a memory, which increases cognitive overload, difficulty, and error. So it‚Äôs vital that designers have a basic understanding of the human mind and memory system.Understanding memory will make us better designers because it helps us come up with solutions that we can process easier, faster, and happier.Our memory system is made up of short-term and long-term memories. These memories are functions of perception and context.Perception is how we form memories. We gain perception through our sensory systems (touch, taste, smell, hear) which trigger neural patterns in our brains. These neural patterns are what get reactivated when we try to activate a memory. The more often a neural pattern is reactivated, the stronger it becomes, and the easier it is to activate.But perception also needs context. For example, hearing a loud noise while walking alone at night triggers different a neural pattern than hearing the same loud noise while inside with your friends.Perception was originally believed to be the combination of sensory stimuli. But in the early 20th century, three German psychologists ‚Äî Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler, and Kurt Koffka ‚Äî discovered that perception is more than the sum of the sensory stimuli. Their findings gave birth to what is known as the Gestalt principles (e.g. proximity, similarity, continuity, symmetry, figure/ground, common fate, etc).Gestalt principles are prominent in designs all over the world and were born from our understanding of perception, which is a part of memory.To use human memory in our designs, we must know our audience.Apple knows their audience really well: a large following of cult-like nerds that would never give a Windows machine a chance. But in our case, we are analyzing the Apple Support page, which has an upset audience.We often remember the emotional things: the first time you drove your car will be more memorable than the 100th time.Likewise, we remember how awful it feels when our Apple products aren‚Äôt working. This is the audience that goes to their support page.Brilliantly, Apple uses this picture to ‚Äúzen you out.‚Äù Notice how there is a lot of space and every person is being helped by at least one Apple employee.As designers, we aim to design for short-term memory because we don‚Äôt want the users to activate their long-term memories and increase cognitive load.The Apple support page is designed to be easy to use. There‚Äôs no drop-down menu, limiting the number of options to choose from and preventing cognitive overload. All of the call-to-action elements have the same text, color, and shape. And if you click on the search bar, the most common issues users search for come up.The Proximity principle says this: when we put elements and information next to each other, we perceive them as being grouped.The Similarity principle states that we tend to group elements we perceive as being similar (color, size, type, etc.)The Continuity principle: our visual perception tends to perceive continuous forms, even when it‚Äôs not a continuous form.The Figure/ground principle helps us create the perception of depth.As designers, we must use the human memory system to our advantage. Whether it‚Äôs designing for short-term memory or long-term memory, the gestalt principles or an angry audience, memory plays a profound role in all their designs. Hopefully, this article helped you understand how important memory is, and hopefully I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I forgot what I was going to say.",18/07/2019,1,0,5,2,726,333,8,0,0,4,293

How to prevent your users from making mistakes,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-prevent-your-users-from-making-mistakes-d641c6260b29,Moritz Bittner,324,8,1462,"We all do make mistakes. No system, no product, no situation can be totally free of the possibility to err. The challenge for UX, interface and interaction designers is to minimise the risk for users to make mistakes and ‚Äî because mistakes will occur anyway ‚Äî that the consequences are as little as possible. The best way to achieve this is to design with the error in mind. With all the obstacles that could cause users to make a mistake.To design for error, designers have to know where errors can occur in the product they are designing (usually everywhere). Where can users make mistakes? Where can they lose data? Where can they destroy the effort they have put into the system? Which mistakes are crucial and which are minor?Designers have to be aware of the fact, that errors can not only be caused by the user but by the surrounding environment. Bad internet connection, small screens (or big fingers), bright sunlight, low battery etc. The designer must be aware of the circumstances in which their product will be used.Systems usually have more than one ideal state. UX and UI designers therefore should keep all the possible states of their system in mind: empty, loading, partial, error and ideal. Scott Hurff designed a neat little graphic related to this:There are several ways to find the critical moments where your users can struggle. The most reliable one is user testing. While testing your product, wireframes or prototypes on actual users, designers will see where users struggle, fail and get frustrated.If you have a running system, but no resources for user testing, the use of analytic tools like Google Analytics can be of great help. Where are your users bouncing? Where do they spend unusual long amounts of time? Are there connections between the use of a certain device and bounce rates? Hundreds of correlations can be used to identify possible causes of mistakes.If you have neither user testing nor any analytics, you have to rely on your team and your understanding of the product and the user. Define the points you consider critical in terms of being error-prone and design very carefully around these areas.When the team has identified the critical points in their system and elaborated why users could fail at these certain points, they have a variety of different methods to prevent the appearance of errors.Confirmation and error messages are the most common instruments to prevent errors. Whenever someone is closing a text document the program will ask if the user would like to save the changes they made. When users are entering wrong credentials in a login screen most systems will tell them about it. The Google service Gmail goes so far as to recognise what users have written in their email and shows them a message that asks for confirmation if they used the words ‚Äúfind attached‚Äù in their email, but didn‚Äôt attach anything to it. This shows high understanding of situations, where users are likely to make mistakes.The same goes for the messaging service Slack. When Slack has the feeling you might be going to annoy a lot of people with your message about the cake sale at your child‚Äôs school on Friday, it will give you a friendly warning.It is important not to get too overprotective with your users. Error messages and notifications can also be very annoying. Designers have to find a balance between being helpful and being bothersome. A way to handle this matter is the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt show again‚Äù checkbox. If you are a really smart cookie, you can let your system learn how familiar a users gets with the product and stop asking him if them if they are really sure to do something, because it knows the users tends to do that all the time.When you know that your users are likely to make mistakes in a certain process of your product, you can instal preemptive warnings or signals which shows your users that they are about to make a mistake or to prevent them from doing so.The people at Mailchimp ‚Äî generally known for doing a great job in matters of UX ‚Äî wanted it to be foolproof for their users to generate a rather strong and non generic password while creating a new account. To achieve that, they did two things: They listed the requirements for the password below the text field, fading out one by one when achieved and gave the text field the feature of showing the password. They added the ‚Äúshow‚Äù feature to prevent errors, because they were aware of the fact, that these non generic passwords at one point tend to be quite complicated. Additionally this method helped to get rid of the notorious necessity of having the user enter his password twice, as it is common in so many register forms (which itself was created to prevent errors from happening).Adding constraints to prevent errors has a long history in safety and usability engineering. A BMW will not go over a certain speed although the car would be able to do so. A chainsaw will not work if you don‚Äôt use both hands and push several buttons at once. Designers can add constraints to digital products as well, to prevent errors from happening. If you have a text field for a credit card number, make it impossible to enter anything else than numbers. If you want the content of a text field to be of a certain length, make it impossible to enter more than a certain amount of letters.When you add constraints to your product, you can make your users play by your rules. But be careful not to limit the freedom of your users in matters that harm the overall user experience.The first Adobe Photoshop from 25 years ago did not have an undo-button. Something that is unimaginable for today‚Äôs designers. The undo-button gives users the chance to work more freely and to not be afraid of making mistakes. This is a freedom you don‚Äôt really miss until you do a mistake and discover that there is no undo-button.A great way to prevent mistakes is to enable users a look into the future. Give your user a preview of what their actions will do. Preview functions are especially known from print settings or Photoshop- or photo-app-filters. Previews allow users to experiment with settings and features without the fear of consequences. They allow the user to learn more about your product and give them the opportunity to get more engaged with the system.The print setting of Apple‚Äôs OS allows the user to see how the printed pages will look like. It encourages the user to find out more about the possibilities of the settings, because the risk of making a mistake is minimised.Errors and mistakes can occur because the system fails, because the internet is down or because the user does something wrong. Either way, the appearance of an error is not a pleasant thing most of the time. Errors and mistakes often cause stress and anger in the user. At this point designers can help the users to reduce their level of stress and anger.The reason behind friendly and funny 404-Pages is the attempt to reduce the anger of the user about a failure of the system. The program shall not be associated with failure, but with delight. People in a good mood are more likely to forgive. Many websites have acknowledged this fact today. A fine example comes from the people of mint.com. It‚Äôs not the error that is in the center of attention, it‚Äôs the humorous distraction of it.On the other side, if your users make mistakes, don‚Äôt be too harsh with them. Stay friendly, positive and engaging. Again the designers at Mailchimp did a great job. In stressful situations they react with a certain humour. The use of these humorous interactions is carefully applied. These delightful interactions loosen up the user in tense situations.Errare humanum est ‚Äî To err is human. Errors and mistakes will always be a part of human life. The task for UX, usability, interaction and visual designers is to minimise the chance of error and to diminish the outcome of mistakes if they appear. A careful analysis of the product itself and the interaction of the user with it, is necessary to find error-prone moments. A design with the human error in mind is key. Building forgiving systems with the help of ‚Äúundo-buttons‚Äù, carefully placed confirmation messages, constraints that guide users and the possibility for the user to take a look at the possible consequences of their actions will help to reduce mistakes. In case of errors or mistakes the tone should be kept friendly, clear and engaging. Don‚Äôt be too harsh to the user or to your system.",18/07/2019,2,0,16,15,844,400,12,1,0,2,321
UI design tutorial: adding visual dynamics into a static prototype,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/ui-design-tutorial-adding-visual-dynamics-into-a-static-prototype-f7653a43227b,Roman Kamushken,3000,7,1239,"The material of this article is the result of my design experiments and conclusions for the last year or year and a half of continuous design grind. I‚Äôve been tirelessly raising Figma design systems, experimenting with content in placeholders, styles, shadows, texts and states to see if this affects conversion any way. In other words, to see if I can increase sales of UI kits if I add some visual dynamics to static design layouts to make templates more interesting and functional.Below I`ll show some simple techniques to add some useful effects to ordinary static prototypes. That won`t affect quality, a visual variety in the repeating elements will be added up. Perhaps this will help to make your best shot on Dribbble or win a few points in the eyes of the customer or the team-lead, because of the use of these techniques positions you as a performer attentive to UI details.setproduct.comAlas, I haven`t yet found a way to determine the metrics of certain visual techniques that I regularly experiment with. I tried to analyze all my UI design developments and organize them from my subconscious into a convenient and understandable list of simple tricks to make the design a little more fun. Maybe it‚Äôs just fun and catches the eye, maybe this causes more subscribers to come, maybe it‚Äôs something from the near future, and maybe it doesn`t make any sense. As I said above, I can‚Äôt be sure that the attendance and browsing performance of my site is growing thanks to these techniques of adding ‚Äúvisual dynamics‚Äù to static layouts. But I like to believe that the UI effects I`m describing below directly or indirectly influenced my overall progress.So, I‚Äôm going to talk about how adding a variety of states to a static prototype adds a little bit of dynamics to it, showing some eventIf your artboard uses a lot of cards, blocks and other similar elements, one of the sample can be ‚Äúraised‚Äù by a shadow. This technique is appropriate both for large elements, such as cards, and for small UI components, such as menu sections in the side navigation. It seems that we`ve put the cursor on the card and can click it:For example, navigation to several depth levels is often used when prototyping dashboards. To give it some dynamics, I made the first level of Getting Started activated and added the onHover style on one of the unfolded submenu elements. In addition, it`ll help developers to get all the necessary menu states and see how integrally it looks holistically and in the context of navigation:The circles, squares, crosses, blobs and other visual rubbish flying at the background are an integral part of the UI design craft, especially if you want to promote your profile on Dribbble. The only thing that is changing is the geometry and shape fashion. I started thinking about how to give it more sense and use it for the benefit of the user experience:Running some useless element as the background sometimes becomes useful if it helps to delimit the objects:Simulating the ability to make a selection or highlighting an element as active is a great way to add variety to a prototype. Even if there is no logic in this choice, in the end, such a technique will at least show you as quite competent in understanding of the UI components states after a fictional interaction with them:From time to time, Emoji is found in apps as a way to amplify a message to the user or as part of a design language. When prototyping, you can quickly assemble a logo, taking any icon as a basis or strengthening the message of the Empty state screen. By the way, sometimes it is faster to stick an emoji symbol than to select an icon from the library. Figma renders them perfectly well, but if you overdo it with the text height, pixels pop up. Anyways, Emoji will help to add some personalization and positive, or even meaning to your layout:We face some situations where design pushes us to make a choice that is beneficial for business every day. Basically, this is done by highlighting or prioritizing the desired area, block, button, or any other part. According to these principles, you can somehow highlight or contrast one of the repeating objects in the group. Some column in the table or a speech bubble with the product review, unendingly drawing attention to it:When you design a prototype that uses many text fields, it looks great if one of the inputs is highlighted as active. This can be a focus, an error, or a validation state when something has already been entered. Use your imagination, reproducing the real situations that are possible when filling in inputs, and it will help you to simulate the most realistic picture:Every designer should understand the physics of space. Now the shadows from UI objects have returned to our service, but they`ve come back reinterpreted after several years of oblivion, being replaced by the flat-trend. Now they are more realistic and more organically used in the design to create the desired effect. Therefore, you should have a good idea of the objects on the canvas in space and make the blur and transparency of each shadow logical, depending on the effect you want to get:It‚Äôs simple: the ‚Äúhigher‚Äù the object from the zero plane (background), the greater the transparency, blur and offset of the shadow. By the way, in Figma, it`s often more convenient to create realistic shadows with the usual Rectangle, which I`ve rounded corners and applied blur >200 to in this example. Next, I brought it to the most realistic view, creating the effect of navigation ‚Äúsoaring‚Äù over the dashboard with the simple Resize. Fortunately, you won`t see that in production. You have to resort to such tricks to understand which Dribbble posts the audience reacts better to. But that`s a separate topic of the design product promotion, we`ll talk about it some other time.Today‚Äôs design is damn interesting. Over the last year of constant UI experiments, it seemed to me that design is like an open-source product: everyone in the community can bring something of their own to it, and if this fork turns out to be promising, the rest will pick up this wave and carry it to distant shores.Now, looking back, I can honestly admit to myself: all my previous years of design experience weren`t worth a penny. Switching to my own products and creating one UI kit after another, I managed to make a huge leap in my practice, simultaneously polishing the experience of the organization and improving the architecture of design systems in Figma. But now I have a huge repository of components and their possible states in my head. And if you wake me up at night and ask me about Tabs, for example, I`ll instantly tell you everything about them:If you are wondering whether to build your UI kit and try to sell it, I`ll tell you that it`s definitely worth it. It turned out to be much more interesting to invent design tasks for yourself than to wallow in a lot of clueless edits from another customer. In the worst case, you`ll gain more experience. With a good combination of circumstances, you will get the first sales, which will probably spur and motivate you even more.Go for it! ü§ôFollow me everywhere: Dribbble, Behance, YouTube, Uplabs, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Instagram",18/07/2019,0,0,20,0,1050,606,12,0,0,9,207
Absolutism in design perspectives,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/absolutism-in-design-perspectives-36c57ee9edcf,Rabin Pizarro Bote,1,2,456,"Absolutism is neither realistic nor tangible ‚Äî it is a glitch in the fabric of human thinking. Various figures have tried to create futuristic energy production methods through unlimited sources while failing miserably, while history has seen prolific political figures attempt in obtaining absolute political power, only to see their empires succumb to dust.Just like political dogma, design theory is far from absolute, and will never be absolute.If there is no such thing as absolute design, then how do people come up with fantastic ideas? Perhaps you‚Äôve been wondering how successful software applications transitioned from plain ambitious ideas into amazing game-changers. Without spending time on design thinking, ideas will remain raw in form and function.Design thinking is a human-centered process of brainstorming to come up with a creative and innovative solution to a specific set of problems. It is a selfless act because, through design thinking, creators immerse themselves with their audiences to understand how a product will serve its purpose for us, the users. Just like the scientific method of solving problems, it uses different research methodologies with inquiry-searching tasks to come up with a plausible solution.As a computer science graduate, design thinking is oftentimes overlooked by a number of students I‚Äôve encountered. Most of the time, students come up with brute-force methods to solve solutions without considering efficiency and long-term satisfaction. Design thinking may not contain the prestige of mathematics and theoretical CS, but it offsets its lack of hardcore technicality by being emphatic and human-centered. Design is more than just eye candy ‚Äî it should offer human-centered approach to progressively address problems.One of the first tasks I completed as a software development intern is a simulation of a one-week design sprint summarized in one day. The task seemed daunting at first, but it aimed to give us, the interns, an insight into how design sprints work and what it is composed of. From brainstorming to surveys to customer journey maps, all of the processes within design thinking are focused on empathy.The essence of groundwork [aka surveying/crowd-sourcing and research] is something I appreciated because without understanding the users on a personal level, creators will never be able to satisfy their needs. By learning the concerns of the end-users, we shape our product into something that is for them.At the end of the day, the products and services we create should serve its purpose of addressing specific issues rather than perpetuating the status quo. After all, the conventional needs some breaking, we need to think progressively if we want to stand the test of time.At the end of the day, nothing is absolute. In the process of designing all things human, design thinking is the bridge to ideate the unthinkable and to reach the unreachable.",18/07/2019,0,0,1,7,,,0,0,0,0,15
Designing for complexity ‚Äî part I: the challenge,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-complexity-a-series-part-i-the-challenge-cdd9f63d2fdc,Maria Andrea Silva,74,2,386,"Solving a Wicked Problem with Design Thinking and Agile MethodologyThe ChallengeIn real life, design thinking and decision making aren‚Äôt simple linear processes. The problems addressed by designers seldom fall solely within the boundaries of any concrete discipline. Getting to choose a specific wicked problem to work with was a liberty we were excited to explore.The idea was to address a complex problem that many people experience throughout their lives, just by living in a modern city.‚ÄúTechnology is changing the way we interact with each other. Many processes and tasks that required a long time to do in the past are now a matter of clicking a button and voil√°!As the public system incorporates technological solutions to big infrastructures, our experience as citizens should see that change too.How Might We transform the end-to-end experience in public hospitals? From requesting an appointment with the doctor to engage in community initiatives or volunteering.‚ÄùInitially, we thought that with the amount of information out there, it would be relatively easy to choose one topic and ideate a solution for it.At first we got carried away and got distracted from the wicked problem concept to a simpler issue: the experience of a pregnant woman in a public hospital.We assumed that pregnant women were the ones struggling the most among all other users. Since we felt confident about that theory, we jumped into all possible solutions.We were thinking on building healthcare apps, clouds, software‚Ä¶ all of this without realizing that we didn‚Äôt have ANY concrete or defined problem yet.We were heading in the wrong direction and right away this was our very first lesson.What we think a user wants is not necessarily the same as what a user actually wants.

We were ‚Äúprojecting our rationalizations and beliefs into the other‚Äôs actions and beliefs‚Äù, as Don Norman describes.User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process.Understanding who our user was (what their needs, goals, and motivations were) was key to help uncover and solve problems that actually exist in their lives, and for that we needed research.uxdesign.cc",19/07/2019,2,0,6,5,1050,787,1,0,0,1,278
What is Acid Communism?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-acid-communism-e5c65ecf6188,Stuart Mills,346,5,1051,"Acid Communism was the proposed title and last substantial philosophy of the late Mark Fisher. The unfinished nature of acid communism has left a tremendous amount of debate and hypothesising about the nuances of concept. This lack of clarification has also had an unfortunate side-effect, with people taking the phrase, ‚Äúacid communism,‚Äù at face value.Acid communism is not a doctrine of hippy-esque communal living and psychoactive drugs. The commune, and psychoactive substances, have a role to play in the philosophy of acid communism, but acid communism is not a valorisation of a hedonistic, hallucinogenic culture. In my opinion, acid communism is an evolution of thought, following from Fisher‚Äôs work on the hauntology of culture and capitalist realism. To grasp what acid communism is, therefore, we need to understand these preceding ideas.Amongst the many things Mark Fisher did so well was his ability to distil complex ideas into brief but powerful summaries. Hauntology is the belief that the future has been cancelled. Capitalist realism is the belief that there is no alternative to capitalism. It is from these statements I will begin.What does it mean to say that the future is cancelled? For Fisher, it meant an inability to imagine anything new. His work on cyberpunk is a testament to this. The cyberpunk aesthetic we all understand is one that meshes advanced technology with late-stage capitalism. But to build that aesthetic, the familiar yet alien are transposed into the scene: the Japanese culture of Blade Runner, for example, may adorn the futuristic scenery, but its presence is a product of 1970s/1980s American xenophobia of the Japanese economic miracle subsuming their own. The great pyramids, skyscrapers and flying cars are all futuristic, but it‚Äôs retro-futuristic. It is how we used to imagine the future.This is hauntology. In a world where the future has been cancelled, where we are unable to imagine new futures (we will get onto why shortly), society and culture is forced to look back onto the imaginings of previous generations. This, I would argue, is as good an explanation for the proliferation of everything nostalgia within the West; of the ever more salient culture of reboot and remake.Hauntology is easily misconstrued as a much lesser idea; the lamentable critic calling out Hollywood-types for their lack of creativity and originality. Fisher‚Äôs hauntology, however, goes beyond this criticism. For Fisher, the ill of nostalgia (algia literally means sickness, ache, pain etc) does not come from a choice not to imagine new futures, but from an almost pathological inability to do so. Now we turn to capitalist realism.Capitalist realism is the belief that there is no alternative to capitalism. Another phrase often associated with capitalist realism is, ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.‚Äù I‚Äôve written previously about how these statements are related via the depressive forces the former implies. Namely, no matter how bad capitalism gets, it‚Äôs always better than the alternative. And if there is no alternative, we quickly arrive at the end of the world.What does capitalist realism have to do with hauntology, or acid communism? Firstly, of course, there‚Äôs the parallel between the constrained thought which is a symptom of hauntology, and the constrained thought which is the primary feature of capitalist realism. But I think this can be explored further.I‚Äôve argued, though Oli Mould‚Äôs Against Creativity argues much better, that capitalism constrains creativity and innovation. Within capitalism, creativity must be profitable. This separates the creative from the creative industry; in the creative, the only limits are one‚Äôs imagination, in the creative industry, the only limit is one‚Äôs value ‚Äòcreation.‚Äô This idea quickly descends into a rehash of the lazy idea above: that Hollywood-types choose to not imagine new futures because they‚Äôre just interested in money.But for Fisher, under capitalist realism, this explanation misses the point by assuming choice rather than pathology. It is not that creatives choose profit, it is that they must choose profit, and given such coercion, they abandon the notion of any choice at all. Thus, we arrive at hauntology, where the pathology of capitalist realism leads to an inability to imagine the future: the future hasn‚Äôt just been cancelled, it was never planned from the start.The evidence? Let‚Äôs return to Blade Runner, only this time let us note that amongst the familiar and yet alien(ating) that we transpose onto our vision of the future is capitalism itself. Even in our imagined future ‚Äî a future borrowed from the past ‚Äî we cannot imagine a world without capitalism. We are trapped within the haunting realm of capitalist realism.Acid communism emerges from Fisher‚Äôs constant cry within Capitalist Realism to imagine a new future. The communism element is debatably symbolic, simply representing a philosophy that goes beyond capitalist realism, and thus into a world that could go beyond capitalism itself. There is an interesting discussion to be had about the communistic nature of our possible future, by for now, let us not linger.The, ‚Äòacid,‚Äô part of acid communism is the means to fulfil Fisher‚Äôs desire to imagine the future. Of course, some people take a superficial view of this part, though I think Fisher choose Acid Communism partly for the advantage this superficiality provides. Acid communism is about ways of imagining a world after capitalist realism, and for Fisher, one of the ways to escape this reality is psychoactive drugs. The programme of acid communism is not to condone psychoactive drug use, but as an example this activity captures the philosophy of acid communism excellently.To imagine new futures, we have to find ways to break out of our present myopia. Fisher‚Äôs acid communism is unique primarily for placing this goal above all others. For example, Marx‚Äôs call for class consciousness is a very acid communist idea, but the means of achieving class consciousness (the critiques and contradictions of capital) dominated much of Marx‚Äôs contribution. If Fisher had had more time, perhaps this would have been the fate of acid communism too, attempting to imagine new ways of achieving acidic or post-capitalist realist thought.Instead, acid communism leaves us with a simple message. The future has been cancelled because we are unable to imagine anything other than the present. To invent the future, to escape our myopia, we have to go beyond the present bounds of our imagination. This is acid communism.",18/07/2019,11,0,0,6,1050,1574,1,0,0,7,1200
When experience meets technology,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/when-experience-meets-technology-f47032214eff,Naomi Bendet,19,7,1495,"New technologies bring new challenges to those who design them. They create a new interaction experience which changes the way we work. How will these new technologies transform user experiences? How can designers make sure they focus on creating human-centered experiences in the face of new technologies?It all started when I was repositioned at my company. The main brief was, we have great technology, and it‚Äôs time to go to market. I said great, what‚Äôs my role in it? Well, it‚Äôs a new technology, we are not sure what the market is.Oh, I said, well give me something, who are the personas? What problem are we trying to solve? Who are our competitors?These are excellent questions I was told, that is exactly what we needed to figure out.Years have passed, and I consolidated a new approach to the traditional UX approach. Until now, the product solutions focused primarily on the technical capabilities and their services necessities. Going to market faced them with a new reality, the consumers. Focusing on needs to be twisted toward UX in order to succeed, it must add value to the customer.A colleague from a different field once asked me, why should we find experiences for technologies? We find experiences for users; for their problems, technology is the tool.It reminded me of the rise of instant messaging. We didn‚Äôt expect people to message each other when they could actually talk. It seemed like a waste of time and energy; we created a new experience, that in a way, contradicted our expectations and experiences based on new technology.Working in an R&D center gave me a heads-up of what the technology is bringing to users, new technologies mean new interfaces for users, and I would like to point out a few of them:The question is not whether AI will change the game for user experiences, but when it will happen. AI sounds realistic more than ever; bots or personal assistants don‚Äôt even sound futuristic. The main challenge in designing software based on AI is actually a paradox. How can you design a generic product or experience that is based on personalisation?Designing AI products is based on best practice, we are still studying the use of these products, but they are already out there. Real-world AI products are already being used by people on a daily basis from personal assistants to self-driving cars and through predictive analytics.We started with a rough concept, and we are improving it with the help of data coming from the users and their behavior. Today, we already have the best practices for voice design (such as personal assistants) and conversation design (like chatbots) based on a conversation that companies, using AI technology track and map. Google has completed some interesting work putting together the book People and AI Guidebook. These practices will continue to develop and be the northern star.If we would expand our reality or have no limits to it, new technology would come around. Data and new experiences will folate all around you, if it feels real that means it‚Äôs real (doesn‚Äôt it?). Today, VR is used more in the gaming industry since it‚Äôs considered fun and extreme experience. We are trying to break the boundaries between the entertainment area into the real world, where people actually consume the product for a reason. The line between the fun world to the real world is thin; it needs to create real value. We need to solve a problem. We can imagine it, but we are still struggling with finding a common use of this technology. Breaking new grounds with these technologies will inevitably result in new opportunities and experiences in our lives. Think about a scenario that we wouldn‚Äôt just be adding layers to our reality, such as another screen or data. It would work the other way around; we‚Äôll shape our physical environments to match the virtual one for benefits. Science fiction? We can wait and see.Unlike the above- mentioned, IoT has an interface that can be easily confused with ‚Äúthe same that we know but smaller.‚Äù However, designing a great user experience for IoT products is easier said than done. IoT systems often consist of a couple of devices, input-output data streams. Building intuitive user experience for a new app alone is challenging not to mention several applications and interfaces. One of the biggest challenges regarding user experiences tasks in IoT is minimizing the gaps between the physical world of connected devices to smoothing the experience in the system elements. IoT involves a sequence of interactions between users from a virtual system to the physical one. IoT products are more complex than a single application or a device; therefore, it‚Äôs not enough just to build a set of intuitive cross-device user flows. We want to create an experience that guides people on how to use and seamlessly integrate IoT products into their operations and everyday life. IoT systems are based on connected things, such as asset tracking, smart home & cities, industrial machinery, connected cars, etc. The user experience for such IoT products should be tightly connected to their physical design and real-life use while bringing a new experience, design, and interface to these technologies.New technologies are bringing in addition to the fun experiences, forced moral quandary out of philosophy department and into our streets. Our experiences shape our bias and our behaviours, but our behavior is a much more complex system that is based on a large range of reasons, one of them is a moral pattern.Let‚Äôs take for example a scenario wherein the near- distant future we have a mixture of new technologies, combining IoT, 5G, AI, and machine to machine technology to an experiment that might get real. The scenario; We are entering the age of self-driving cars, autonomous cars. Autonomous is only one parameter of the car, but It‚Äôs actually a supercomputer on wheels.Now imagine that the self-driving car is approaching a group of people that are crossing the road, and the only way to save them is to move out of the way. One problem, by moving out of the way, that move would run the car into a wall and kill the one passenger in the car. Of course, this scenario must be calculated in advance, so what should the car be programmed to do? Save the group of people or save the one person in the car? One vs. group.If you ask most people this question as a theory question, I think most people would say, kill the one person and save the group. Wouldn‚Äôt you? However, the answer is more complex than only this one question. Forget the theory, let‚Äôs go to market, would you actually buy a car that is programmed to kill you? This is my machine; this is an AI product; it can‚Äôt kill the owner.Suddenly this is a real-world question.Let‚Äôs add some other layers just to complicate things, what if the car can actually calculate whom to save in real-time? It can calculate a group over an individual or a boy over an old man, healthy over ill, VIP over a homeless person. Moving a couple of years later, add the network layer, imagine a scenario where cars are getting to a decision point, and they are confirming whom do you have in your car vs. whom do I have in my car? I have a bus full of kids, and you have an old man with cancer. Saving one person over another would be kind of privileged what brings us back to the need for new rules that define morality worldwide. Bill Ford Joiner said (Ford company, October 2016) ‚Äúno one company is going to solve that. Can you imagine if we would have one algorithm and Toyota had another and GM would have another?‚Äù. This explores the potential issues surrounding human needs raised by mobility, autonomy, trust, and accessibility.So what‚Äôs the experience we are actually looking for? How can designers make sure they focus on creating human-centered experiences in the face of new technologies?We should make sure we‚Äôre leveraging computers to create a new experience, not serving them.According to Gartner, 89% of companies will be competing on the basis of customer experience. They also predict that by 2020, two billion devices will have zero-touch UIs available.New technologies are exciting but will fall short if they don‚Äôt address human needs and enhance a user‚Äôs experience. In order to do that, We‚Äôll need to get the technology out first and see how they would interact and how we would interact with them, this means continuously learning and understanding new technologies and contexts when designing for people. Designers will need to rethink and create new mental models for future human-machine interactions. In addition, there‚Äôs an increasing need to take into account wider social and ethical considerations when designing user experiences.To designers that are confused by the changing requirements I can only say; smile, you just got promoted from solving problems to shaping the future :)",18/07/2019,0,0,3,1,705,395,4,0,0,1,590
6 tips for designing better mobile sign up forms,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/6-tips-for-designing-effortless-mobile-sign-up-forms-e3d3f4a44ca7,Katherine Fairbanks,339,4,595,"It‚Äôs important that the process of signing up for your application is a stress-free one, especially since it‚Äôs the first experience users will have with your application.Through my research on what makes a sign up form delight rather than disappoint, I have compiled 6 tips for designing sign up forms.1. Only require signing up when necessary.A sign up form as the first screen for an application can deter users from wanting to use it. By allowing some functionality and information to be accessible to users without logging in, users become familiar with your application without committing to signing up right away.For our mock example, users are able to view and search for products, and are only prompted to sign in when trying to perform actions that require a sign in, such as writing a review of a product or trying to view the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù tab.2. Include a social login.Giving users to sign up for your app through a social media platform like Facebook or LinkedIn allows users to skip filling out forms. It‚Äôs one less barrier to users to begin using your app or website.Social media logos like Facebook‚Äôs blue ‚Äúf‚Äù are recognizable to most users, and will definitely be recognizable to a user looking to use Facebook as a way to login to your application, so there is no need to label social media icons on your app screen. Save precious real estate on your mobile screen by keeping the social media icons simple and label-less.3. Top align your labels.  Users fill out forms faster when labels are top aligned. This is because top aligned labels allow users to move down the form in one visual direction. Left and right aligned labels require two visual directions to fill out.The only downside? Top aligned labels can cause increased form length. This is why I recommend inset labels as shown in the example. This visual solution keeps your form fields top aligned without dramatically increasing the length of your forms. As shown in Google Material Design, you can also have the text field label in place of the input text, moving from the middle of the text field to the top (if the field is selected). With this solution, your labels will always be visible, but never in the way.4. Show the value in signing up for your application.By indicating why signing up for yet another application will be valuable to your user, you‚Äôll have a much easier time getting users to follow through with the process. Clearly define the value your application brings to the user in concise and clear language, prominently placed within the UI.5. Kill the confirm password field.While common on many sign up forms, confirm password fields lower your conversion rate. Because a password field typically masks the user‚Äôs input, a confirm password field is thought to reduce typos. A confirm password field doesInstead, implement an unmasking option, indicated in our mock example with a simple, tappable icon to the far right of the form. This icon is universally recognized and is quickly becoming the standard for signup forms.6. Define text field styles.A text field is an input field that a user can type into. It has a range of options and supports several text formats including numbers.Text fields have two major states: enabled or disabled. In the enabled state, these user interactions are available: default, error, hover, idle & filled, focus, and disabled. Text field inputs can be either empty or filled, valid or invalid. Defining these different states with visual design gives the user feedback when interacting with the interface.",18/07/2019,0,0,6,0,1050,598,5,0,0,1,88

It‚Äôs not a book about technology, but the design mindset. I really enjoyed this book because it gave me quite a different perspective on functionality and solution design.When we talk about design, the first thing that occurs to me is industrial design, for example, designing a speaker or chair. But if we put ‚Äúdesign‚Äù into our work scenario, it will look more like service design, the Dynamics 365 system we build, the different technologies like Flow, Power Bi we recommend, the documentation we produce, the user training we provide. We need to combine some design mindsets to ensure that our Dynamics 365 solutions are unique.First of all, let‚Äôs start with the process. This book explains that:Human-centered design isn‚Äôt a perfectly linear process, and each project invariably has its own contours and character. But no matter what kind of design challenge you‚Äôve got, you‚Äôll move through three main phases: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation.This is similar to an Agile approach. We come across the term ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù very often in the technology industry nowadays.Agile is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment.From my experience working as a Dynamics 365 consultant, more and more projects are adopting the Agile methodology. Unlike projects using the ‚ÄúWaterfall‚Äù methodology, when we start the project, we don‚Äôt actually have all the requirements and design documents; rather, we are building while designing and refining until we have a mature system that is tailored to the customer‚Äôs need.Back to Human-Centred Design Processes:Inspiration is like the discovery, elaboration, or business analysis. At this phase, shadowing with the business team, understanding the end-users‚Äô daily job, and then trying to think about how we can find a way to mirror a process in CRM. For example, if the business users use Excel spreadsheets frequently, it‚Äôs worth considering whether we can do something in CRM to replace some spreadsheets. Or if the business users manually pull up a list of specific records, maybe we can think about creating a view, a marketing list, or even a dashboard to give more insights on the data that the business team collects.Ideation can also be part of the elaboration phase but here, we will actually start to create something. We can write down some requirement, create user stories, finalise some design processes, do some Proof of Concept work, or give time estimations.The last phase of this cycle is Implementation. Here comes the exciting building stuff! Recording how much effort you put into each task, obtaining feedback, and passing quality assurance. These are also very important components of Implementation.Now, let‚Äôs talk about mindsets. Seven areas have been explained in this book; I think they are all very valuable for us.Creative Confidence, of course, we need this. There are so many new features coming to Microsoft Dynamics family. If we are still using the same old technologies, we easily become ‚Äúdeprecated‚Äù. For example, one day I saw an article about this new functionality: ‚ÄúDynamics Portal can be enabled for uploading documents directly to a Sharepoint location‚Äù. So I tried it out on a piece of POC portal work for a client, and it worked perfectly fine. In this case, we don‚Äôt have to configure a Microsoft Flow to move the documents from Dynamics CRM to Sharepoint and worry about the limited runs on Flow.Make it. This is fairly straightforward; the design in our mind is great, but the exercise to make it happen is greater. Until you create something, play around with it, and show it to the end-users, you will never know what needs to be improved.Learn from Failure. I can‚Äôt count how many mistakes I have made since I started to work with Dynamics CRM. Simple things like Business Rule‚Äôs scope is not set correctly, Security Roles are not included in the solutions, Data Import with an unsupported format, not fully understanding customer‚Äôs requirements, etc. I have to say, I learnt a lot from all of these failures and will aim to do better in the future.Empathy. This is particularly important for technology-related jobs. Since we configure and customise CRM systems all the time, it‚Äôs easy for us to understand how they work. End-users, on the other hand, might have never seen such systems before. These users have no idea what is called an ‚Äúentity‚Äù or why you keep saying ‚Äúbusiness process flows‚Äù. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to put yourself in their shoes and use their language to explain the work you‚Äôve done for them.Likewise, when we design any business process, we should make good use of persona. For example, if we are Customer Service Officers, when we pick up a phone call to record a complaint, what information we need to verify, what information we want to record, how to make the process as easy as possible.Embrace Ambiguity. We definitely hear this question a lot: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù. True, sometimes for Agile projects, we are not entirely sure about what has to be done. So don‚Äôt be afraid of asking questions and exploring all possibilities.Optimism. I know work can be stressful and frustrating. But to be a good human-centred designer / CRM consultant, we have to be optimistic. Only because this job needs a lot of workarounds, when we cannot get it right at the first attempt, just try again. We will get there in the end!Iterate, Iterate, Iterate.As human-centred designers, we adopt an iterative approach to solving problems because it makes feedback from the people we‚Äôre designing for a critical part of how a solution evolves. By continually iterating, refining, and improving our work, we put ourselves in a place where we‚Äôll have more ideas, try a variety of approaches, unlock our creativity, and arrive more quickly at successful solutions.Iteration is crucial for Agile projects; the scrum master usually refers to each iteration as a ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù. Each sprint is a timebox; depending on the size of the project and the number of people booked on it, it can be, say, one week or two weeks. We normally have some recurring activities for each sprint, such as sprint planning, refinement, playback, bug triage, etc. From each cycle, we identify some issues and then try to do better in the next cycle.This book also provides many templates and case studies on how to create a project plan, conduct interviews, and use storyboards during the three aforementioned processes: Ideation, Inspiration, Implementation. Although many tips in this book aren‚Äôt related to Dynamics 365, I still found it worth reading. Good to keep eyes open and know what others are up to!Reference:https://www.ideo.org/www.agilealliance.orghttp://www.designkit.org/resources/1",18/07/2019,0,0,23,3,898,782,7,0,0,8,21
Implementing and scaling a data-informed design/CRO process in a global corporation,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/https-medium-com-timdekker-how-we-set-up-a-data-driven-design-process-in-a-global-corporate-cb68e83b7cc0,Tim Dekker,42,5,884,"In a span of 9 months part of our design team at The Valley have been working on setting up a decision process for our designs in the global corporate that is based on quantitative evidence. Not just anecdotal comments from users.It sounds logical, but to get everyone on our side was an uphill battle.I‚Äôve included slide decks and templates of processes we used, in case you find this useful in your scenario.‚ÄúAmazon does it too‚Äù mentioned our client when they wanted a feature. When I started on the project, the loudest person in the business would determine which direction to go in, impacting 42 markets worldwide‚Ä¶There were few user tests with qualitative data to combat this. These were outsourced to a global research agency. Sadly the argumentative power of it was not enough; ‚ÄúLovely comments, but how do is this helping us sell more?‚ÄùChanging the mindset of the client required something more than these comments. There was no active data team where we could get quantitative insights from to validate our insights and convince business. Our design team needed to initiate it themselves.One problem; tooling licenses were controlled by someone up the corporate ladder. Someone with a budget to keep in mind‚Ä¶The only way forward was to convince the man up top to grant us the resource capacity we needed.We invited the data team of the corporate (Lewis; a 1 man army) to come over and discuss how we could kickstart a collaboration. Defining goals, responsibilities, tools and next steps to convincing others.In the meantime, the UX Chapter Lead and I sat together to scope out the processes we needed and created the first slide deck of many to come‚Ä¶Below you can download a template version of the slide deck we used.Download slide deck from DropboxOnce we settled with the data team on a good approach (this took multiple meetings), we invited stakeholders in these meetings, in the hope they would become invested and act as an advocate.2 Product Owners and a Project Manager were willing to take up this journey with us, IF we could promise good results.To ensure we got sign off from the right people we decided the best way forward was to do a pilot test with our approach and use that as a case to convince management.Connected through the PO we reached out to the Dutch local market as a start of what would become a smooth collaboration. We helped them with maximising the return of their campaign they planned to run.Our first simple A/B test increased conversion by 7%Being transparent and overly communicative with all stakeholders was key to make this a success. It helped increase ownership of the local market and PO. Resulting in them becoming an advocate of our process.Instead of us sharing insights we integrated Usabilla comments from our users in a separate #customerfeedback channel and invited all stakeholders ( of whom had Slack access) to the channel. This increased the transparency and awareness immensely.Later, when showing new designs, we received comments like ‚ÄúOh I think someone mentioned being confused by the current filter options!‚Äù Finally some proof we were on the right trackThe success story spread in the organisation and soon we had 2 other markets, Poland and France, who wanted to collaborate.Right now we are at the point were our roadmap is informed by our analysis of drop offs, sign-ups, heat maps and funnels. Each item is then tackled by further analysis with qualitative research to make sure we‚Äôre tackling the right problem. Helping PO‚Äôs to prioritise and the product team to build the right thing.We found this framework from conversionXL work well at scale to align many people. Adjusting some metrics to fit our own project.That however still meant most ownership was with our team, not throughout the global corporate organisation.We invited key stakeholders to an Experiment Workshop where we showed data insights from Google Analytics & VWO. Asking everyone to come up with solutions to these problems and forming them to experiments we could run.To help create clarity and ownership among the organisation we created a trello board with all experiment cards, linking them to Jira stories. This way anyone could add it, as not all corporate members had access to Jira. The PO had the final call on which experiment to launch.Below you can find the template we created in Trello for all experiment cardsConvincing decision makers was the biggest driver in implementing this new process. It also was the biggest struggle was to get them involved.Only after, all the other management levels took real action to implement it. Increasing transparency and having 1on1‚Äôs with stakeholders to involve them in the new approach from the start were key components for success.Having a pilot test with 1 local market helped immensely into convincing others by making a good example. So start small and build from there. Spreads like wildfire.Templates for the processes supported keeping everyone aligned across the globe, onboarding new members & helping decision makers.All of the above requires regular reflection and adjusting where necessary (e.g. retrospective) and currently we‚Äôre still upgrading our way of working.Thank you Natasha, Remco, Lewis, Carolina, Jurre, Shivangi, Thijs & Emma We came a long way with our combined effortWould love to hear your thoughts & experiences.

Got a good idea? Test it!,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/got-a-good-idea-test-it-2b1cc69d7f9d,Bora Kilic,38,6,1208,"You left another year behind in the blink of an eye, and you entered 2019 with fresh ideas. Do you want to get to the physique you dream of with a gym membership and a planned regular training program? Or, quitting your job to which you feel increasingly estranged, and bring that business idea to life?The characteristic feature of these two scenarios is the need to make certain investments or sacrifices to achieve the goal. Most simply, you have to pay six months or 1 year of a gym membership on the first day.To pursue your dream of entrepreneurship, the free time left over from your work hours most likely will not be enough, and you will have to resign from your work. Before you take these steps, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to know if you can actually go to the gym regularly or whether your business idea has considerable potential?Let‚Äôs look at the subject in the context of brands and products/services they offer to their customers. Suppose that an innovation competition was held in the company, and creative ideas emerged. Is the decision of the jury enough to determine which idea is worth investing? Alternatively, is it possible to proceed with a test and data-driven approach and determine the best idea for investment?Yes, it is possible!In 1999, three youngsters put two large trash cans with the words Yes and No next to their smoothie booth at a UK music festival and asked the participants: Should we leave our job to make these smoothies? At the end of two days, the bucket that said yes was filled to the brim. This is how the story of Innocent, which has become the most successful smoothie brand of England and perhaps the world today, begun.The test which was conducted by the trio of graduates of the University of Cambridge, Richard, Adam, and Jon can be described as ‚Äúguerilla‚Äù testing. The guerrilla test method is a relatively low-cost method that allows you to get quick feedback on your product or prototype. The most classic example is to grab people who you think are involved in your target audience and get feedback from them.If you are reasonably assertive or skeptical, the test result in the Innocent sample may not be enough for you to make the final decision. Rather than blindly embarking on the adventure, checking the pulse of your potential customers can benefit you in your decision making.‚Äî‚ÄúA problem well stated is a problem half solved‚ÄùCharles Kettering‚ÄîMost of the monologues that start with the phrase ‚ÄòI have an excellent idea,‚Äô directly address the solution without mentioning the problem. On the other hand, solutions are created and exist to solve a problem. Therefore, before verifying your opinion, it is necessary to test the problem that your solution aims to solve.What if the problem you wholeheartedly believe exists isn‚Äôt received well by your target audience?Let‚Äôs look at an example. A bank whose motto is to make life easier has a new product idea. This product brings convenience to payment processes for real estate and car sales. This is done through a system integration, which triggers the transfer of money and the transfer of deed-license simultaneously. In this way, risks such as cash transport of large amounts and the possibility of deed transfer without the payment transfer no longer exist.That sounds good, doesn‚Äôt it? However, what if we told you that a significant number of people who sell a house choose to do it in cash and declare a lower house value to receive a tax advantage? Or that when the bank loan is used, the loan amount is transferred to the seller automatically with the transfer of the deed?When you think that your target audience does not have a significant problem in this regard, doesn‚Äôt the solution begin to lose its appeal?Let‚Äôs move on to a parallel universe and assume that the research results confirm the problem. The target audience really feels the risks we are talking about and is in search of a solution.In this case, it is time to test how much demand there is by the target audience to the bank‚Äôs solution. The most significant benefit for running this test is that it offers a chance to verify (or kill) the solution without substantial investment.How to test a product that doesn‚Äôt exist yet? By doing ‚Äúas if‚ÄùThis method, which is referred to as fake doors in English, is frequently used in idea verification processes. Imagine advertising on real estate sites as if the product is ready. The users who click on this advertisement will read this message: ‚ÄòOur product will be implemented very soon. Thank you very much for your attention and patience!‚Äô Thus the first step of the test is completed. By analyzing the ad‚Äôs clickthrough rates, you get the chance to gain insight on current demand.Finally, let‚Äôs emphasize that the following 3 points should be taken into consideration in the problem and idea verification studies:The concept of testing is a critical part of ‚Äòdesign thinking,‚Äô which is to consider the logic of the design, and it has gained much popularity recently. The cycle that constitutes this methodology consists of researching and defining the needs of the user, producing the solution corresponding to this need, testing the prototypes if possible, and bringing it to life after applying the changes from the feedback. Based on this cycle, we can say that the testing phase is the starting point of improvement.The diagram was designed by Nielsen Norman Group.In particular, brands operating in the digital environment use this methodology to improve the experience which they offer and increase the transformation of their digital assets.Let‚Äôs say the product team of an e-commerce website that sells organic food products thinks that sharing positive customer comments on the home page will increase the rate of users viewing product category pages.To test this hypothesis, first, determine the metric to be measured and check the current value for comparison. For the test result to be considered successful, the target percentage increase is determined. Then the test phase begins, and the alternative design with user comments starts to be shown to 50% of the traffic.After reaching a sufficient number of visits which can grant confidence, the results are compared, and it is decided whether to proceed with the current design or the new one. This setup is called the A / B test. It is also possible to test more than two variants at the same time, or even run multiple tests at the same time.When the domain name Amazon.com is pronounced today, a single entity is revived in everyone‚Äôs mind. However, Amazon has simultaneously done so many tests that it is not possible to talk about a single Amazon.com.The test-driven approach allows you to make decisions based on data and reduce the risk you take instead of basing on your intuition, which is more than likely to mislead you.Nowadays, especially with the decreasing cost of digital test methods and tools, the applicability of this approach has increased.Internalizing the test logic and making this approach part of your thought processes, whether in business or your private life, will benefit you to the extent that you cannot imagine. Of course, do not quickly accept my hypothesis, test it first!https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-run-experiments-for-idea-validation-1fb71d99ea06https://www.nngroup.com/articles/no-validate-in-ux/https://www.viima.com/blog/idea-validation",19/07/2019,1,0,2,1,874,534,5,1,0,6,122
Updating Users to the Latest Version of Your iOS App,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/updating-users-to-the-latest-app-release-on-ios-ed96e4c76705,Ross Butler,453,9,1539,"When an emergency arises, it can be beneficial to have a mechanism in place to gently transition users to the latest app update. However, such a mechanism might require a backend solution to let app users know when an update is released which has the potential to be costly both in terms of development overhead and maintenance. Where the choice is between developing such a solution or delivering new functionality to the user, the latter is likely to win out meaning that most apps have little or no means of migrating users should the worst happen.When it comes to migrating users to the latest version of an app we are fortunate that iOS does the majority of the legwork for us. The default App Store setting is to automatically download app updates overnight which means that typically the majority of users will receive the latest app release within a few days.But what if within a few days isn‚Äôt quick enough? What if an API we have no control over unexpectedly changes resulting in a loss of all functionality? Or a certificate used for SSL pinning expires unexpectedly? Unlike in web development, isn‚Äôt possible to easily roll users back to an earlier version of the software therefore isn‚Äôt hard to imagine that there could be times where it might be useful to be able to migrate users to the latest version of an app containing the latest bug fixes etc. App developers will clearly try to avoid such situations but if we fail to anticipate scenarios like these ever occurring then it will be too late to act when an emergency does arise.Exceptional cases aside, there are probably quite a few occasions where it might be nice to let users to know that a new app version is available ‚Äî for example, if a new app feature is available in the latest release which has been widely publicized or a fix has been released for that non-critical but annoying issue the user has been experiencing.Apple are highly successful in creating a pull factor which encourages users to update to the latest version of iOS. Additionally, iOS itself makes it clear to users via badging and notifications that a new version of the OS is available. Thus, the majority of iOS users tend to be running either the latest or previous version of the iOS. For developers this means we rarely need to very old versions of the operating system. As far as getting users to update to the latest version of our app is concerned, having a recent version of iOS the majority of devices is obviously a great help - particularly if our app only supports the two most recently released versions of iOS.However, consider an app supporting an older version of iOS the development team wishes to drop support for. If the team drop supports for the older version of iOS then the app update will no longer be automatically offered to users on that version of the operating system by the App Store until they update. Furthermore if the user‚Äôs visits the app‚Äôs page in the App Store they will only be able to see the latest update their device is eligible for. It could be worthwhile letting users know that a new version of the app is available to them once they update a later version of iOS so that they don‚Äôt make the assumption that development of the app has ended.Updates is an open-source framework which automatically checks to see whether a new version of your app is available. When an update is released, Updates is able to present the new version number and accompanying release notes to the user giving them the choice to update. Users electing to proceed are seamlessly presented the App Store in-app so that updating becomes effortless.A framework which is able to handle much of this automatically is beneficial as development teams are usually, and rightly, more focussed on developing new functionality to deliver value to the user than on implementing functionality for updating users which might never need to be used.Updates makes use of the iTunes Search API to retrieve the version number of the latest version of your app available from the store. Along with this, the release notes and numeric App Store identifier are fetched for your app which means that when a new version is released, Updates is able to tell your users the version number of the update as well as what‚Äôs new.The framework is able to automatically resolve the user‚Äôs device locale ensuring that the app update is for the relevant App Store territory as well as details such as whether or not the user‚Äôs device is eligible to receive the update.Using the numeric App Store identifier, if the user elects to update then Updates can present the App Store using SKStoreProductViewController allowing the user to seamlessly update without ever having to leave the app.If you would prefer to set this information manually (rather than having Updates retrieve it for you), you may do so by specifying the necessary information as part of a JSON configuration file. Furthermore, having a JSON configuration file allows you to specify whether or not Updates checks automatically or manually ‚Äî you may then later toggle this setting remotely. It also possible to configure all settings programmatically.To have Updates automatically check for new versions of your app you may configure the framework using a JSON configuration file. You need to let Updates know where to look for the file by specifying a configuration URL as follows:Alternatively the URL may reference a local file / file in your app bundle using a file URL e.g.A simple configuration file might look as follows:Note that Updates looks for a top-level key called updates which means that it is possible to add to an existing JSON file rather than creating an entirely new one.The above configuration tells Updates to resolve all of the information needed to determine whether a new version of your app is available automatically with minimal configuration. It also indicates that users should only be notified once about a particular app update to avoid badgering them. Alternative values of this property are twice, thrice, never and always.Having a remote JSON configuration allows for the greatest amount of flexibility once your app has been deployed as this makes it possible to switch from automatic to manual mode remotely and then provide the details of your app‚Äôs latest update yourself should you wish to.You may forego a remote JSON configuration and simply configure Updates programmatically if you want as follows:This is equivalent to the configuration in the above JSON snippet.To manually notify users of updates to your app configure your JSON file as follows:If you chose not to host a remote configuration file, the same configuration may be obtained programmatically:Regardless of whether you have configured Updates to check for updates automatically or manually, call checkForUpdates in your app to be notified of new app updates as follows:The UpdatesUI component described in the next section can be used in conjunction with this method call to present the App Store in-app (using either a SKStoreProductViewController or SFSafariViewController in the event that the former cannot be loaded) allowing users to update seamlessly. Alternatively you may elect to implement your own custom UI in the callback.The callback returns an UpdatesResult enum value indicating whether or not an update is available:In the case that an update is available, an Update value is available providing the version number of the update as well as the release notes when using automatic configuration:Note that the value of notify property in your JSON configuration is used to determine whether or not shouldNotifyis true or false. Where writing custom UI it is up to the developer to respect the value of shouldNotify. If using the UpdatesUI component this property will automatically be respected.The UpdatesUI component is separate from the core Updates framework to allow developers to create a custom UI if needed. For developers who do not require a custom UI, UpdatesUI makes it as simple as possible for users to update. Users will be presented a UIAlertController asking whether to Update or Cancel. Should the user elect to update then a SKStoreProductViewController will be displayed allowing the update to be initiated in-app.In order to display the UI simply pass the UpdatesResult value returned from the update check to the UI as follows:It is prudent for developers to plan for the need to migrate users to the latest version of an app whether in the case of an emergency or as part of planned update such as dropping support for an older version of iOS. Updates is a framework designed to help developers with this task by automatically detecting where a new version of an app is available from the App Store and presenting an optional pre-configured UI component to users gently nudging them to update.Where the choice is between developing new features to deliver value to user or developing functionality to migrate users to the latest app release, the former is likely to win out, making a migration solution with minimal development overhead beneficial.Updates can be found open-sourced on GitHub under MIT license and is compatible with both Cocoapods and Carthage.",19/07/2019,2,10,0,6,500,500,3,3,0,5,514

5 Lessons For All Businesses From NASCAR‚Äôs Death Spiral,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/5-lessons-for-all-businesses-from-nascars-death-spiral-b80fab57ab98,R. Shawn McBride,454,7,1618,"We can all learn from this fiasco.It was early. About 4 am and we were getting in the car. A 3 hour drive and we‚Äôd be at the magical place: Dover Downs. And hours later they‚Äôd drop the green flag and my father and I would be smiling from ear to ear as we‚Äôd watch the cars go around and around.It was 500 miles of racing back then on the 1-mile racetrack. But it seemed glorious.I would watch NASCAR grow from my childhood into a massive sport where crowds of 100,000 or 200,000 people at a single race would not be uncommon. Every time we showed up there would be more people. The traveling carnival that was NASCAR would get bigger and bigger.Today NASCAR tracks are removing seats, TV ratings are down, and NASCAR is admitting they‚Äôve lost their way.I too have largely stopped watching NASCAR races. Recently I was in Daytona on the day of the NASCAR race and I didn‚Äôt even go.Why have I ‚Äî and so many others ‚Äî stopped caring about NASCAR? I started studying this. There‚Äôs a lot of talk out there.And from that talk I‚Äôve rounded up 5 strong lessons for us ‚Äî business owners and leaders ‚Äî to remind us of what we need to do in our businesses to be successful.I am not sure, exactly, what NASCAR‚Äôs product is. But people are showing up there to buy something when then come to the race ‚Äî often from far away and at great expense ‚Äî and they want that product. The product is, obviously, entertainment tied to racing with some combination of other add-ons.What exact combinations of things, and experiences, the race fan wants when they come to the track is open to debate. If you‚Äôve ever been to NASCAR you‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs more than just a race. It‚Äôs really a moving carnival of vendors, displays and events that goes from track to track. And then there is the race itself.People want a certain experience. Watching NASCAR‚Äôs attendance numbers drastically drop over the last decade tells us they don‚Äôt know what the fans want. They aren‚Äôt the first big company to get it wrong. Blockbuster thought people wanted to rent discs when they really wanted to watch movies and Kodak thought people wanted film when they wanted to capture memories.For us that are running our enterprises that are smaller than NASCAR, Blockbuster or Kodak the lesson is clear. We have to know what our product is and stay focused on that.And I can guarantee one thing for you ‚Äî your customers aren‚Äôt lining up to buy the product you tell them they want. In fact things should work the other way. If you are doing things right you should be listening to your customers and giving them what they want.The France family, that runs NASCAR, seems to have missed this memo. While less and less fans come to the track they have tried a dizzying number of rule changes. No one seems to know where these rule changes come from or how they they are tested. Rather than polling fans or having conversations it seems that someone comes down from Mount NASCAR with new rules for everyone to abide by.And no one within the sport can really question those new rules. In fact, NASCAR has sweeping rules mimicking those of a communist country stating that participants can‚Äôt say things against NASCAR or that will harm the sport. In one incident in 2013 a driver said something ‚Äî no one really seems to know what ‚Äî to a journalist that lead to the suspension of the driver and the journalist went to NASCAR about the statement and it was never published. What kind of power does NASCAR have that will make them so powerful that the media self-censors?The hushing of the media should shock us more than whatever that driver may have said.Many other incidents can be found such as a driver having to pay a $35,000 fine because they questioned a lug nut rule. In the oddest of twists NASCAR changed in rule in light of the criticism to make the sport safer but still fined the driver for telling them how they could increase safety for drivers, crews, fans and even NASCAR employees.The lessons for us business owners is clear. We need to learn how to listen to our customers rather than guess what they want and force it upon them. And we need to make criticism, particularly that that increases safety, safe to give.And with their rules the heads of NASCAR seem opposed to having real conversations. Not only are they guessing what the customers what they are also not getting the best of input.To paraphrase my friend and fellow speaker, Dr. Daren Martin, ‚ÄúNone of our minds is as good as all of our minds.‚Äù With a sport as complex as NASCAR there are a lot of questions and a lot of possibilities. No one person, or even small group, is going to be able to figure it all out.In fact NASCAR‚Äôs leadership is largely made up of the family of the founders and people that have spent their careers in the sport (such as former crew chiefs). While experience is beneficial it also leads to ‚Äúgroup think‚Äù or everyone repeating each other‚Äôs thoughts.NASCAR‚Äôs downward spiral seems to show a lot of this group think as no one seems to have new ideas to put forth. And even if new ideas came along they couldn‚Äôt be expressed due to NASCAR‚Äôs enforcement of rules to keep criticism at bay.For the rest of us we should know our businesses sometime suck. Sometimes our processes fail. Sometimes we don‚Äôt give the customer what they want. Taking internal and external criticism can enable improvement. And sometimes we need someone from the outside to come in, look our business over, and say ‚Äúwhat are you doing here and why?‚ÄùOutside thoughts and criticism, channeled correctly, can be our path to improvement.Another thing NASCAR is missing today is trust. Back in the day you could believe that NASCAR would be back at your track again next year, with a competitive race, and that when a driver spoke you could believe them.Fast forward to today, a day and time where most every sport has their rule book open to the public and you‚Äôll find NASCAR does not. Why is NASCAR so afraid to let others know what their rules are? Those that aren‚Äôt afraid to speak out will tell you they think it‚Äôs so NASCAR can do hometown officiating.But surely all of the teams in the sport ‚Äî that should have access to a rule book ‚Äî will keep each other accountable, right? Not so fast. NASCAR fines those that criticize the sport so no one can really challenge their decisions.Some have even question how the series champion is now determined. A racing season is a long season with different tracks, different cars and a lot of variables like mechanical breakdowns, other drivers having accidents (which you might get involved in) and tire failures. Back in the day that was all averaged out over a season.Today that‚Äôs not the case. Today NASCAR has a ‚Äúplayoff‚Äù system where the winner of the series is determined in the last race. Long story short many traditional fans know that with all of the variables of racing it‚Äôs not fair to crown a champion based on one race. It‚Äôs not how other major racing leagues do it ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the way NASCAR does.For the rest of us we need our customers to believe in our products and services. Not only do we need to say they are quality but they have to believe that. In some way we have to reassure them with more than us saying so.With all of this we see NASCAR continuing to decline in popularity. In a rarely reported fact NASCAR‚Äôs premier track, Daytona, did recent renovations and took seating capacity down from about 159,000 to about 101,000. And TV ratings are dropping too.At some point it‚Äôs OK to collect the feedback and say that you made a mistake. Hopefully the folks at NASCAR know what their product is ‚Äî or what it used to be ‚Äî and they can go back to offering that to their fans.They wouldn‚Äôt be the first to take a step back. Coca-Cola rolled back the introduction of New Coke in the 1980‚Äôs and saved their future. Maybe NASCAR can do something like that and save itself too.For the rest of us the lesson is clear. If we make a big mistake and do something that doesn‚Äôt work we can go back and reset. It‚Äôs OK to admit a mistake, go back and repair our foundation.NOTE: This article is a piece develop a small portion of the content of the book Entrepreneur to CEO being co-authored by The Our Shawn McBride and Ann Gatty.

The Ultimate Guide to On-Perm Kubernetes,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-ultimate-guide-to-on-perm-kubernetes-84b564f0acc,Pavel Glukhikh,88,17,2495,"When I first dove into Kubernetes back in early 2018, I wondered why anyone would use such a complex (and expensive) service when there are many other ways to host applications such as Vmware products an Hyper-V. A short while ago, I was asked to develop a highly available setup across multiple cloud and on-prem environments, and that‚Äôs when it hit me: if you want to enjoy the benefits of Kubernetes in an on-prem datacenter environment, there are ways of doing so while having a highly available environment, cloud-like automation, and the best of all: full and absolute control over the entire stack, from the management infrastructure and hardware, all the way up to the application and how traffic is routed to it.There are many guides out there on how to set up Kubernetes, some for AWS, some for Azure, and a few of them for on-prem deployments. However, most of the on-prem guides I have seen are either out of date, inaccurate, or are not optimal for a production environment. In this guide, I will describe, in detail, how to set up a production ready on-prem Kubernetes environment with automation and all features Kubernetes has to offer. As always, I accept comments and suggestions on how to make this setup better. This guide was inspired by a post I read on inkubate. It covers much of the same steps, but in a more clear way, updated for 7/2019 and fixes a lot of errors (the original does not have the proper steps to set up the cluster as of 2019 due to breaking changes).Before we get into it, let‚Äôs answer the following questions:First, let‚Äôs look into why you would want an on-prem Kubernetes cluster:Next, let‚Äôs define the goals we want to accomplish with this deployment:Now, let‚Äôs get into the actual deployment. This is the deployment overview. We will preform the deployment in five steps:What you will need for this deployment:The deployment consists of 8 servers:It‚Äôs a good idea to create a key to match the IPs in this guide to your own:Load Balancer -192.168.2.51 /Master 1- 192.168.2.52 /Master 2- 192.168.2.53 /Master 3‚Äì192.168.2.54 /Worker 1 -192.168.2.55 /Worker 2‚Äì192.168.2.56 /Worker 3‚Äì192.168.2.57 /The machines will all run Ubuntu 18.04, however I have gotten this to work on 16.04 as well (with the same steps). The virtual hardware requirements will vary depending on how many resources you want to allocate to your cluster and what the cluster‚Äôs workload will be. For my environment (which will be production), I gave each worker and load balacner node 3 GB of RAM, 4 vCPUs, and ~a 80GB HDD. For each worker, I used 4‚Äì6 GB of RAM, 4vCPUs, and a 120‚Äì200 GB HDD. Remember that for most virtualization platforms, you can re-size disks, and add / subtract resources as you need to.Now let‚Äôs look at the hypervisor. My deployment runs on a Vmware Vsphere managed ESX Enterprise cluster consisting of 9 nodes, 20 TB of storage, 700 GB of RAM, SSD acceleration, graphics co-processors, and about 120 CPUs. Is that overkill for this deployment? Yes. Obviously you don‚Äôt need all of this to run this deployment. If you are just starting out, I would recommend using a high-end PC, gaming computer, or a small ESX cluster. Basically, anywhere you can run Vmware Vpshere server, you can run this deployment.Note: VSphere server is required for the automation part. If you are running just ESX or some other hypervisor, the deployment will still work but you will need to set up each node by hand or use a manual VM cloning process. Eventually, I want to make the automated deployment process work cross-platform, but for now, we will be using VSphere server.Now, the fun begins. Let‚Äôs login to the VSphere UI and starting deploying the cluster. This guide assumes that yo already have a properly configured VMware VSphere cluster that is ready for VM deployment. If not, look for my upcoming post on how to set one up.First, you will need to create a standard Ubuntu 18.04 server machine. We will use this machine for setting up automation and kubectl. The machine can have minimal specs, but I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM, 2 CPUs and an 80 GB disk.When setting up the machine, the only pre-requisite is that it will need access to the network that the Kubernetes nodes will be on. Otherwise, the default install options can be used (hostname, username, etc). For packages, you will only need the standard system utilities and sshd at this time.It‚Äôs assumed that you know how to deploy an Ubuntu machine. If not, have a look here.Next up, we need to install the certificate generator, kubectl to manage Kubernetes and Terraform to set up the other VMs.First, let‚Äôs install Cloud Flare SSL:Once, everything is done, let‚Äôs verify the cfssl version:If everything was completed correctly, there should be a version output in the string returned by cfssl.Next, let‚Äôs install kubectl:1- Download the binary:2- Make it executable:3- Move the binary to /usr/local/bin:4- Verify the version of kubectl: (note: this will throw an error at this time)Next, we will install the automation tools on the client machine and build the template VM that Terraform will use. We will be using HashiCorp Terraform to clone an existing VM template to create the Kubernetes cluster.First, you will need to set up a new Ubuntu 18.04 VM with 4 GB of RAM, a 120 GB HDD, and 4 vCPUs. You can change these specs in the deployment configuration later if you want. The VM should only have the standard system utilities and sshd on it at this time.The name of the template should be ubuntu-18.04-terraform-templateNote: it is a good idea to create the VM from scratch and run a clean installation. Don‚Äôt reuse the client VM.You can also install any management tools you need on the template VM at this time (snmpd, monitoring agents, etc). Make sure that these do not interfere with Kubelet or etcd services.Important: you will need VMware tools on all of the VMs, so let‚Äôs deploy the package to the template:1- Download the VMware tools onto your template VM (you have to create a VMware account if you don‚Äôt already have one). To make it easier, you can SCP the package to the template VM from your machine.2- Decompress the archive.5- Mount the VMware tools ISO.6- Extract the VMware tools installer.7- Unmount the VMware tools ISO.8- Remove the open-vm-tools package. We will be replacing it with the full install of Vmware tools.9- Install the VMware tools (leave all the options as default).10- Reboot the machine.After reboot, we can clean up the VM:1- Remove the temporary network configuration.2- Prevent cloud config from preserving the hostname.3- Power off the virtual machine.Now, you should have a fully configure VM that is ready to be converted into a template.Note: Make sure the VM adapter‚Äôs network configuration is set to a network that can access the rest of the Kubernetes nodes.Next, let‚Äôs go back to the client machine and set up Terraform:1- Download Terraform from the HashiCorp repo.2- Unzip the archive.3- Copy the binary into your path.Note: Terraform is multi-platform. In theory, you should be able to do this from a Mac or Windows machine as well.We are going to use a script developed by sguyennet to clone the VMs.Note: I absolutely HATE vim. Editing in this tutorial is done by via nano.1- Clone the script repository:2- Terraform init:3- Configure the deployment of your HAProxy machine:In here, you will need to set the following:5. Do an ls in the folder and make sure you don‚Äôt see a terraform.tfstate or tfstate.backup file. If you do, delete it.4- Deploy the virtual machine. This will be your HAProxy node.This should start the deployment of your HAProxy machine. Note: if you mess up, you can always do terraform destroy.We can now create all of the other VMs. Remember, for this guide, we will need one load balancer, 3 masters, and 3 workers.Go back into your tfvars file:Change the machine virtual hardware specs, hostname, and IP for each run. You will need to repeat this step for each of the VMs you need to create.For each step, edit the tfvars file, and doImportant: delete the terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup files AFTER EACH RUN. Otherwise, each apply operation will replace the previous operation.(I‚Äôm planning on correcting this in the future).Remember, you can only use terraform destroy right after each run. When you delete the tfstate file, you wipe Terraform‚Äôs memory and will not be able to auto-revert.Once you have completed all of the run operations, you should now have a blank series of nodes that are ready for installation of Kubernetes components.(You can also keep the template and use it for your other deployments using Terraform or some other tool.)It is a good idea to test access to each node to make sure they are up and accessible.Now, let‚Äôs set up HAProxy on the LB node.1- SSH to your HAProxy node.2- Update the VM:3- Install HAProxy:4- Configure HAProxy to load balance the traffic between the three Kubernetes master nodes:Your config may look different depending on the HAProxy version. The only things that need to be changed here are the IPs. Change the bind IP to the local IP of your HAProxy node. Change the master 0‚Äì2 IPs of thier local IPs.For this guide, I used 192.168.2.51 for the HAProxy machine, and 52‚Äì54 for the master nodes.5- Restart HAProxy:Check that HAProxy has started successfully:Next, we will need to go back to the client VM to generate the TLS certificates via the CloudFlare SSL tool.1- Create the certificate authority configuration file:2- Create the certificate authority signing request configuration file:Change the details in the config file to your own.3- Generate the certificate authority certificate and private key:4- Verify that the ca-key.pem and the ca.pem were generated:Next, we generate the certificate and and private key.1- Create the certificate signing request configuration file:2- Generate the certificate and private key:Note: you will need to change the hostname= IPs to your own.3- Verify that the kubernetes-key.pem and the kubernetes.pem file were generated.4- Copy the certificate to each of the nodes in the cluster:Note: Change the username and IPs to your own.1- SSH to the first machine:2- Elevate to root:3- Add the Docker repository key:4- Add the Docker repository:5- Update package lists:6- Install Docker:1- Add the Google repository key:2- Add the Google repository:3- Update package lists:4- Install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl:5- Disable the swap.Important: Swap must be disabled on boot. Otherwise, the cluster will break on reboot.6. Disable swap from starting at boot:Important: This process needs to be repeated for each of the Kubernetes nodes in the cluster (all masters and worker nodes only).Install and Configure the Etcd Services on the Master NodesNext we will install and configure the Etcd key value store services on each master node.1- SSH to the first master node:2- Create a directory for Etcd configuration:3- Move the certificates to the configuration directory: (you need to do this as the user you used to copy the certificates to the machine, not as root, as they are in the user‚Äôs home dir).4- Download the etcd packages:5- Extract the etcd archive:6- Move the etcd binaries to /usr/local/bin:7- Create an etcd systemd unit file:Change the IPs to your own. ‚Äî name will be the local IP of the first master node. Same for the advertise and broadcast URLs. The initial-cluster IPs are the IPs of the master nodes.8- Restart the service:9- Enable etcd to start at boot time:10- Check that etcd has started successfully:Note: If you have trouble getting etcd to start, review the machine syslog. A common issue is a typo in the config file or wrong IPs, or wrong syntax.Repeat this process for the other two master nodes only.Remember to update the IPs for each node in the config file.Now it‚Äôs time to initialize the three master nodes.1- SSH to the first master node:2- Create the configuration file for kubeadm:Note: At the time of writing, apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2 is a working API version.Note: Replace IPs with your own. The control plane endpoint and the certSANs are both the HAProxy machine IPs. The endpoints are the master node IPs. I used 10.30.0.0/24 for the pod network. You can replace this IP with your own if you like.3- Initialize the machine as a master node:4- Copy the certificates to the two other master nodes:5- On the other two master nodes, create the config.yaml file (don‚Äôt change anything, make it the same as the first master).Then run:On the other two master nodes.Save the join command that is displayed after initialization.1- SSH to the first worker node:2- Execute the join command that you saved from the previous step:Change the IP to your own HAProxy node.Repeat this step for all remaining worker nodes.Verify that all nodes have joined the cluster successfully:1- SSH to the first master node:2- Get the node list:Note: The nodes show as not ready because networking has not yet been configured.Now we need to configure kubectl on the .50 client machine so that we can manage the Kubernetes cluster. Note: this can be done on any machine that is capable of running kubectl.1- SSH to one of the master nodes2- Add permissions to the admin.conf file.3- Copy the configuration file to the client machine and change back the permissions:4- Go back to the client machine and create the kubectl configuration directory:5- Move the configuration file to the configuration directory:6- Modify the permissions of the configuration file:7- Check connectivity to the Kubernetes cluster API from the client machine:You should get a list of the node in the cluster with status of not ready.Weavenet will be used as the overlay network for this guide. If you plan to use an F5 device for ingress, Flannel is recommended.1- From the client machine, deploy the overlay network pods:2- Check that the pods deployed correctly:3- Check that the nodes are in ready state:Note: It may take a few minutes for all nodes to change to a ready state.You should now have a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster.Installing the Add-OnsKubernetes has several useful addons. One of these is the dashboard.Kubernetes Dashboard1- Create the dashboard:2- Delete the dashboard service. We will be using an alternate setup:3- Expose the dashboard:This will expose the Kubernetes dashboard on http://192.168.2.52:8443Change the IP to your own.You can also use alternate methods to run the dashboard: https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/InstallationYou should now have a working Kubernetes dashboard.Now, let‚Äôs login. On the login page, select token.On the client machine:4 - Get the list of dashboard secrets:5- Describe the secret that is named kubernetes-dashboard-token-xxxxx6- Copy and paste the secret onto the Kubernetes dasboard login screen and click login. You should now be able to access the dashboard.And that‚Äôs it. You should now have a complete and fully functional on-prem Kubernetes cluster.Occasionally, you may run into some issues during cluster setup. Not to worry, I have posted the solutions to the most common issues below.Is a good way to start.medium.comThanks for reading.

"Everything You Need to Know About Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchain",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/everything-you-need-to-know-about-public-private-and-consortium-blockchain-54821c159c7a,Mazn Adnan Shkoor,29,6,1222,"Today, blockchain technology has drawn the attention of many individuals and corporations because of the advantages that blockchain technology provides such as privacy, security, and transparency. However, the sole reason for people to be interested in blockchain technology is cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, people use the word ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù and ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù interchangeablly due to lack of knowledge in the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology. All we hear from people are the price of cryptocurrencies went up and down. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency is one of the use cases that blockchain technology provides. To understand blockchain technology in a nontechnical and simplified way, we need to discover some history of blockchain technology.In late 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto has first introduced Bitcoin that uses blockchain technology. In his paper, ‚ÄúBitcoin Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,‚Äù stated that the Bitcoin network uses blockchain technology to record transactions. Therefore, the blockchain is responsible for storing transactions on a trustless peer-to-peer or decentralized network. As Bitcoin becomes more popular, many developers contributed to enhance or develop new protocols (altcoins) that operate on separate blockchain networks. It is true that altcoins use different blockchain networks. However, altcoins use blockchain technology to achieve some of the advantages that we have mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, in 2013, Vitalk Buterin introduced the second generation of blockchain technology. In his Ethereum Whitepaper, Vitalk mentioned that instead of separate blockchain networks for different cryptocurrencies, he introduced a single programmable blockchain network that can be used to build different types of applications. These applications can be built on smart contracts, which can be built with high-level programming languages such as Solidity. Moreover, smart contracts can be deployed on Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, the second-generation blockchain technology can be used in building many types of applications such as supply chain, healthcare, IoT, land registry, and so on.Now, we understand that cryptocurrency is not the only use case of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency is not the blockchain itself. It is crucial to understand the types of blockchain technology that are used in each sort of applications.A public blockchain is a distributed and public ledger, which maintains the records of all the transactions. A public blockchain network is a truly decentralized network, and it does not require a trusted central authority to authenticate transactions. Therefore, it establishes trust in a decentralized network through consensus mechanism rather than relying on central authority such as banks. This would make the transactions on the network immutable once it is stored on the network. The word ‚Äúpublic‚Äù means that anyone can join the blockchain network with read and write access permission. An example of a public blockchain is cryptocurrency. Since anyone joins the network with read and write permission, all Bitcoin transactions are available to the public. You may see the sender‚Äô address, balance, and amount that has been transferred to the recipient‚Äô address. In fact, you may track Bitcoin transactions ever made.Open Read and Write: anyone can participate by submitting transactions to the blockchain. Moreover, transactions can be viewed by the participant.Immutability: Once transactions are stored into blocks, it cannot be altered, or deleted as long as a single entity does not control the majority of the computational power.Security and Transparency: The consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the same block to contain the official transactions. Also, anyone can view the transactions in the public blockchain network.Scalability: The blockchain structure itself is replicated across the nodes. The computational power can scale up and down as miners join or leave the network.Private blockchain has many similarities with public blockchain in terms of structure and mechanism. However, the purpose of a private blockchain is a bit different. Private blockchains are known as permission-based blockchains. The block with read and write access are controlled by an entity or organization and access permission is usually limited in this type of blockchain. Most often, organizations and individuals may not want their users to have access to the detail of every transaction. The owner of the private blockchain, it might be an organization, may wish to control who can read or write to the private blockchain. In order to achieve such mechanism, the owner requires to know the identity of their users because it becomes impossible to define the permission rules about what data can be committed to the ledger and what data can be retrieved from the ledger.Unlike public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, in which the platform provides maximum anonymity, a private blockchain is a permission-based blockchain, which requires the identity of users. It is essential to understand the users so that the owner can determine what information should be accessed or restricted. The reason that organizations use private blockchains is to avoid anonymity. Sometimes businesses are not willing to share their business information with everyone.For instance, let‚Äôs suppose that Amazon would like to use blockchain technology for their platform, where users can buy products through cryptocurrencies. One of the advantages of a public blockchain is transparency, which means every information is exposed to the public. In this case, Amazon would not be interested in presenting their business model and business logic. Amazon would like to have some level of privacy where they can restrict users to access private information such as the original product prices. Therefore, private blockchain would be a perfect solution for organizations to adopt. Through private blockchain, organizations can identify the entity of the users and restrict them from accessing private data.Public blockchains and private blockchains are the same in terms of technology, but with different roles. The value of public blockchain is transparency. However, a private blockchain is to prevent misuse of informationPermissioned blockchain: single entity controls access to the blockchain.Faster Transactions: Private blockchain has fewer nodes or miners, which makes transactions much faster to be confirmed.Better Scalability: The organizations control the number of nodes. Nodes are added to the network based on demand.Better Consensus: private blockchain has fewer nodes and usually have a different consensus algorithm such as BFT.Consortium blockchain can be understood when it is compared with public and private blockchains. Sometimes it becomes a bit confusing when first hearing consortium blockchain. This type of blockchain is known as a semi-decentralized blockchain. A consortium blockchain is not granted to a single entity as a private blockchain; rather, it is granted to a group of approved individuals. Moreover, consortium blockchain is a group of pre-defined nodes on the network. Therefore, consortium blockchains provide security that is inherited from public blockchains. Meanwhile, it gives a significant degree over the network. Most often, consortium blockchains are associated with enterprise use, where a group of organizations collaborating to leverage blockchain technology to improve businesses. Nevertheless, this type of blockchain may allow certain participants to access or adopt a hybrid access method. For instance, the root hash and its Application Program Interface (API) may be open to the public. Therefore, external entities can use the API to make a certain number of inquiries and obtain certain information related to blockchain status. Examples for consortium blockchains would be Quorum, Hyperledger, and Corda.If you enjoyed this, you may also take a look at my other article down below!medium.com‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Thank you for reading this far!

How Amazon‚Äôs Business Practices Harm American Consumers: Why Amazon Needs a Competitor and Why Walmart Ain‚Äôt It,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/amazon-needs-a-competitor-and-walmart-aint-it-5997977b77b2,Molson Hart,227,12,2291,"$1,950,000.That‚Äôs what our company paid Amazon last year.We sell plush and construction toys on Amazon. Well, technically, we sell toys on our website, on eBay, on Walmart.com, to brick-and-mortar stores, and we sell on Amazon. But, really, we only sell on Amazon. In 2018, we had about $4,000,000 in sales but Amazon.com accounted for over 98% of that.Harvard Business School would call this ‚Äúvendor/customer concentration‚Äù. In the e-commerce world, we call it being Amazon‚Äôs bitch.While Amazon received $1.95 million from us last year, they are not afraid of losing our business for a couple of reasons. First, there are thousands of companies out there eager to take our place. Second, Amazon had $277 billion in gross merchandise revenue in 2018. Our $3.9 million in sales on Amazon accounted for .0014% of that. Finally, we have nowhere else to go and Amazon knows it.Mom and pop toy stores are dead or dying. Costco, Target, and Walmart brick-and-mortar stores together maybe sell 300 different toys. Few slots remain for us after they fill their shelves with Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego. Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us is dead because it took on a lot of debt and then Amazon came in and killed it. We sell on eBay, Walmart.com, and our website, but together these non-Amazon channels account for less than 2% of our sales, which is not enough to support a business.Were we to be suspended from selling on Amazon.com, it would probably take 3‚Äì6 months before we‚Äôd be bankrupt. We are not alone. This is typical for small to medium sized businesses which sell online today. In fact, most companies like our own, would probably go bust even faster. Ironically, Amazon is not just the biggest sales channel for almost everyone who sells online, but they are also one of the biggest lenders. When you go bust, they seize your inventory and sell it on Amazon.Because Amazon accounts for such a huge chunk of everyone‚Äôs business, sellers like us are scared to publicly talk about Amazon. We worry that if we speak about what it is like to sell on the platform, we risk our right to sell there, which means likely bankruptcy. I‚Äôve never seen Amazon retaliate against a seller for this, but the threat is real. For example, check out this nasty clause in the contract sellers sign to sell on Amazon. It prohibits us from issuing a press release or making public statements related to selling on the platform.As a friend of mine says, what business gets $1.95 million of your money and won‚Äôt even assign you an account manager? Now Amazon will, but they‚Äôll charge $1600 + 0.3% of your previous months sales for it. For us, we would need to pay about $2625/month on average, just to be heard. Without an account manager, you can regularly expect to wait months for Amazon to address problems with your account. Amazon‚Äôs power over online merchants is not just in sales, but also in the way that sellers are treated.But is that a bad thing for consumers? To answer that we need to understand better how products are bought and sold on the Amazon marketplace. There are three main ways.Method 1, Amazon Vendor Central:Brands and private label manufacturers who make AmazonBasics sell goods directly to Amazon. Amazon takes ownership of the goods, stores them, and when they sell, ships. Amazon Vendor Central products will say ‚ÄúShips from and sold by Amazon.com‚Äù. It‚Äôs old school retail, done online, but it‚Äôs something that Amazon does less of with every year. In 2018, third party marketplace sales, which we will discuss below, overtook Amazon first-party sales to account for the majority of the $277 billion dollars in sales Amazon generated. Amazon may not have big margins on their first party Vendor Central business, but the reality is that most of Amazon‚Äôs retail business is their third party marketplace, which is highly profitable and growing fast.Method 2, Fulfillment by Amazon:Online merchants store their products in Amazon‚Äôs warehouses, and when Amazon sells the goods, they ship it to the customer on the merchant‚Äôs behalf. Amazon does not take ownership of these goods, they are merely stored and shipped by Amazon. Ever seen a product that says ‚ÄúSold by _______ and Fulfilled by Amazon‚Äù? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about.This is a construction toy we sell. It ships from Amazon‚Äôs warehouses. Whenever we sell one for $15, here is what we pay Amazon:We start with $15 and are left with $7.16. Amazon captures about 53% of the total price of the product.Method 3, Merchant Fulfilled or Seller Fulfilled Prime:Merchants store their products in their own warehouses and when Amazon makes a sale the merchant ships directly to the consumer. Amazon does not touch the product. ‚ÄúShips and Sold by _____‚Äù is what we‚Äôre talking about now. This, along with Method 2, form Amazon‚Äôs third party marketplace.This is a giant plush tiger we sell. We ship it from our warehouse in Texas. Whenever we sell one for $150, here is what we pay Amazon:In this case, Amazon takes a lower percentage of the total price of the product, 27%, compared to the 53% taken when fulfilled by an Amazon warehouse. However that is 27% of the total price taken by Amazon when all they did was host the product on their website.We designed, manufactured, imported, stored, shipped the item, and then we did customer service. Amazon hosted some images, swiped a credit card, and got $40.This is the core problem. Were it not for Amazon, this item would be $40 cheaper. And this is how Amazon‚Äôs dominance of the industry hurts consumers.Amazon takes a 15% commission on every product we sell on their website. We don‚Äôt have this fee when we sell toys on our own website, so we could sell our products for 15% less and make roughly the same amount of money as we do on Amazon.Unfortunately, Amazon prevents us from doing so in a couple of different ways. First, diverting customers away from Amazon.com is grounds for suspension, which means bankruptcy. Second, Amazon prohibited us from listing products on our own website for less than we sold that same product for on Amazon. Perhaps fearing regulation, Amazon quietly ended this ‚Äúprice parity‚Äù policy, but now enforce it indirectly. If we sell our products for less on channels outside Amazon and Amazon detects this, our products will not appear as prominently in search and, if you do find them, they will lose their prime check mark and with that, their sales.If Amazon either charged us less or stopped restricting our ability to sell on other platforms for less, we could pass on those savings to consumers. Amazon charges a separate and reasonable price for shipping and storage. However, their 15% commission and Amazon search advertising, together $763,000 for us in 2018, are too high. In exchange for this $763,000, they operate an online catalog and deliver search results. We sell about 200 products on Amazon. Does it cost anywhere near $763,000 to display our products there? Definitely not.Every year that we‚Äôve been selling on Amazon, they have raised their prices, sometimes significantly. When we first started on Amazon, we paid about 33% of our sales on Amazon to Amazon. In 2018, we almost hit 50%.In recent years, given the regulatory scrutiny, they seem to have gotten more creative. Rather than just increasing the cost of shipping, they‚Äôll reduce the amount of free support they provide to sellers, increase storage fees, charge for reviews, or dedicate more search space to sponsored advertising instead of organic search results. This means you see advertised products before you see results based on customer satisfaction. It also means that online sellers must pay more money to sell the same products, so prices go up.Amazon charges a lot for the services they provide, but it‚Äôs not clear that a reduction in these fees to sellers would result in lower prices for consumers. Couldn‚Äôt Amazon sellers pocket these fee reductions as additional profit? They cannot. Most sellers are locked into commoditized competition. Whether it‚Äôs the 38 different sellers trying to win the buy box for Cascade¬Æ detergent or us attempting to capture your eyeballs, followed by your heart, when you search ‚Äúplush goat‚Äù, price is essential to winning the sale. Most sellers on Amazon do not have unique differentiated product and so when margins widen, it just creates more ammo for a price war, which means lower prices for consumers.When you see entire UPS trucks full of boxes with Amazon‚Äôs logo on them, you get the feeling that Amazon is a powerful force in the economy, but it‚Äôs hard to explain how that affects consumers. Now you know how. They charge online merchants exorbitant amounts, online merchants have no choice but to pay, and online merchants pass the bill onto consumers. So, how do we fix this?Some politicians in Washington call for regulation, but it‚Äôs not obvious how to best to check Amazon‚Äôs power. In the past, monopolies were broken up by geography. That does not seem like a good solution when so many packages are delivered from one part of the country to another. And reducing Amazon‚Äôs 15% commission on the products sold on their website, which is an increasingly large part of the entire American economy, feels like setting the cost of bread in a communist country. Further, Amazon could respond by increasing other fees levied on sellers.Amazon‚Äôs share of the US e-commerce market is over 50%¬≤. I‚Äôll let you decide whether or not that qualifies Amazon as a monopoly. However, regardless of your opinion, the US Department of Justice should investigate Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúpricing parity‚Äù and ‚Äúbuyer diversion‚Äù policies right now. They are a restraint of trade that results in harm to consumers in the form of higher prices.I wrote earlier that our $3.9 million in sales on Amazon in 2018 accounted for .0014% of Amazon‚Äôs total sales, way too little to have any leverage in negotiation with them. According to Marketplacepulse.com there are approximately 900,000 active sellers on Amazon‚Äôs United States marketplace¬≥. If these 900,000 sellers were able to form a cooperative to negotiate with Amazon, it is possible that this could result in lower fees, which would then be passed on to shoppers. The goal of this article is to reduce consumer prices, not create a cartel. An estimated 39% of those 900,000 sellers are based in China and this number grows ever year¬π. It may not be possible to achieve cooperation between so many parties and maintain the noble intention of creating a healthier marketplace for consumers.Today, it does not have one. Walmart.com gets a lot of media coverage, but the sales on Walmart.com are just not there. We launched our products on Walmart.com in 2019, and despite taking 20x as long to set up than eBay, it accounts for about 45% of the sales volume eBay does (less than 1% of our sales). Amazon recently launched a program called Amazon Renewed where we sell refurbished items. It alone is doing more revenue than Walmart.com. Walmart is a household name, but in e-commerce, they‚Äôre a non-player.However, there‚Äôs a recipe for creating a competitor to Amazon. It‚Äôs unlikely to happen, but it may be a better option than having government tell Amazon what to do.Forming a partnership between Walmart, eBay, FedEx or UPS, and a tech company like Google will be enormously difficult to pull off, but if it works, Amazon will have a legitimate competitor. Competition keeps prices low and we‚Äôve seen, both with their acquisition of Whole Foods, and their lowering of their free shipping minimum in response to Walmart, that Amazon is no exception. We need to create an Amazon competitor to ensure continued innovation in e-commerce and low prices for American consumers.Jeff Bezos, Amazon‚Äôs CEO and the richest person in the world, has many famous sayings. Two of my favorites are ‚ÄúYour margin is my opportunity‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere are two kinds of companies: those that try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second.‚Äù Recently, Amazon has been much better about executing on the first quote than the second, and that‚Äôs a damn shame.Amazon‚Äôs business, its outsize power in our economy, and its deleterious effects are not well understood by the general public or even our own government. I hope that this piece has made some progress towards curing that. The more people that know about the hidden harm in Amazon‚Äôs business practices, the sooner we can address it and create a better environment for American consumers. So, please share this article. Thank you.[1] : Sellers based in China have numerous structural advantages over their American counterparts and have, for a few years now, not only been crushing their American competition, but have been frustrating American consumers in the process. If this article finds an audience, I can explain why this is and what can be done about it.[2] : That same article also says that Amazon‚Äôs sales are only about 5% of overall retail sales. It‚Äôs important to remember that overall retail sales include gasoline, cars, groceries, food, and beverage ‚Äî categories that Amazon either has no foothold in or does not sell at all.[3] : It‚Äôs a great article with tons of information on the state of e-commerce. Highly recommended.[4] : Since writing the first draft of this article Shopify, an e-commerce platform for sellers who wish to mainly sell on their own website instead of marketplaces like Amazon, has announced their intention to operate fulfillment centers all over North America to create a 2-day Amazon prime competitor.Great thanks to David Short, Macy Frazier, Samuel Lee, and many others who read early drafts of this piece. Their edits and suggestions were huge improvements to the article. Thanks y‚Äôall!",18/07/2019,5,0,8,0,849,553,11,3,0,16,523
These Are The Brand Moves You Should Be Paying Attention To Right Now,Concept Bureau Insights,https://medium.com/swlh/these-are-the-brand-moves-you-should-be-paying-attention-to-right-now-f8ed0aa3773f,Jasmine Bina,6900,6,545,"I write a lot about defining strategy and how to build a brand. My goal is to always look for companies that are doing it right because those are the ones we best learn from (although it would be much easier to simply point out the ones that are doing it wrong).Strategy, however, is only half the equation. The way companies bring those strategies to life can reveal a whole new world of learnings. Their tactics, decisions and moves are all signals to the consumer and to the marketplace.They show us both what people want now, and how much they are willing to tolerate in being pushed into the future.Here are some recent brand moves that have definitely edged the conversation forward.You couldn‚Äôt hear this story without feeling something. After CNN shared images of drawings by migrant children who were recently released to a respite center in McAllen, Texas, the Smithsonian reached out to inquire about obtaining the disturbing works of art. Many of the works depicted heavy metal cages and towering authority figures in hats.The Smithsonian describes itself as a museum, a research and education organization, and an ‚Äúopener of doors‚Äù. But this move is about much more.The brand signal here is clear. While other museums exist to celebrate America, the Smithsonian is here to hold it accountable.Alrosa has tested out an interesting new initiative for its gems: electronic passports that ‚Äúwill tell the buyer the gem‚Äôs age, the place and date of its extraction, as well as the time and place of its cutting and the craftsman‚Äôs name and background.‚ÄùIf you haven‚Äôt heard, millennials are cooling on the complicated idea of diamonds. Alrosa is hoping transparency and proof of sustainability will change that. It‚Äôs a noble brand tactic but not a strategy. Causes are never strategies, but that‚Äôs beside the point.What matters here is who is executing the initiative. Alrosa is the world‚Äôs second largest diamond miner. You may own one of their stones but you‚Äôd never know it.They are a producer taking on the responsibility of a retailer in branding the product, proof that everyone in the supply chain is in the business of branding now.A few people this week emailed me a New York Times interview with Outdoor Voices founder Ty Haney. It was this quote that caught their eye:‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not up against the Nikes, Under Armours and Lulus of the world. What we‚Äôre up against is people‚Äôs negative perceptions of themselves.‚ÄùBut in product terms, Outdoor voices is up against other sportswear and athleisure brands, and that underscores the brilliance of this quote. Ty Haney is talking from a brand perspective, not product. She knows she‚Äôs selling a story first and foremost.Have you seen any smart moves in a vertical?

The Pop Star of Data Science,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/siraj-raval-a-man-ahead-of-his-time-c32128dc856d,Sten Sootla,1960,5,1127,"Disclaimer: The sole purpose of this article is to stir productive discussion by providing an unconventional, perhaps controversial perspective on the seemingly frivolous teaching techniques the data science popularizer Siraj Raval employs in his videos. It‚Äôs not my intention to give an appraisal of his suspicious personal conduct or questionable business ethics, both of which I fully disapprove of.Roughly a decade or two ago, a stereotypical ambitious college graduate saw herself getting a job at an investment bank, wearing expensive suits to work, and celebrating the closing of million-dollar deals at high-end parties. Nowadays, on the other hand, she fancies herself as the flip-flop wearing prodigal software engineer, co-founding a unicorn while traveling the world as a digital nomad.This transformation of interests is also reflected in both the media and in popular culture. People who used to read the Wall Street Journal might nowadays emphasize the startup section of TechCrunch instead. In cinema, modern classics like Wall Street and Boiler Room have been replaced by the likes of The Social Network. In television, The Office has been superseded by its modern satirical cousin Silicon Valley, while the deeply character-centric Mr. Robot was handed the torch by Mad Men.The shift in perception we‚Äôre observing, however, is to a large extent merely migratory: the already ambitious youth, who would have studied something more traditional before, are now transitioning into more technical domains. As such, bringing more attention to STEM fields, as is currently done through various private and public initiatives, is not unlike preaching to the converted. A pupil with no interest in academics benefits little from directives that provide better training to teachers or issue higher-quality instructional materials. Textbooks are of no use if one lacks the curiosity to peek inside their covers in the first place.We, as advocates of technology, ought to think bigger. It is not enough that STEM fields are perceived purely as careers. We ought to start planting ideas from science and technology into the subconscious of the public on a much deeper level. We ought to start losing sleep over the fact that the Kardashians are more famous than any living scientist. Being an exceptional engineer should no longer be merely perceived as an alternative to becoming a superb lawyer, but as a substitute for becoming a star athlete. Prolific developers should start appearing on The Tonight Show, and considered for contenders for People‚Äôs magazine Sexiest Man Alive special issue covers.Such a fundamental overhaul of values would do much more than just bring new people into the STEM community. It would free individuals of all backgrounds and ages from the grips of the modern, relatively superficial popular culture, instilling more productive notions into their minds instead. As Aristotle said, we are what we repeatedly do. As such, one would expect great leaps of imagination to occur when instead of discussing the latest NBA game each Friday night at a bar, a group of friends was passionately expressing their thoughts on the latest patch of Nobel laureates instead.Among the few creators who understand the importance of this is Siraj Raval. With over half a million subscribers, he is the most popular YouTuber in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain. His unique and energetic on-screen personality, which he showcases in his well-produced videos, has made him a household name among data scientists. However, his meteoric rise to fame hasn‚Äôt been easy, as he has had to endure the criticism of many, if not the majority, in the professional machine learning community.The criticism mainly stems from the approach Siraj takes in his videos. His work is as much about educational content as it is about conveying the sheer excitement he has about the topic at hand. More often than not, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly where one ends and the other starts, giving the material a superficial feel. As a result, many shun him for being too superficial and lacking in technical depth. This is arguably true, but besides the point.Siraj is not in the conventional education business as it is usually practiced. He‚Äôs not there to educate the professional, or even to promote the field of AI for the technically adept. He‚Äôs there to bring AI into the real mainstream. Into the eyes and ears of the general public. Not to the people whose YouTube feed already enjoys the presence of Numberphile and Khan Academy, but rather to those who regularly trade such channels for PewDiePie.This all is apparent from the approach he takes in creating his content. In a candid interview with Lex Fridman, Siraj mentioned that his ambition is to increase his subscriber count to a million, so as to reach more people. To get there, he meticulously monitors his analytics, mainly audience retention metrics, in order to pinpoint exactly what works and what doesn‚Äôt in his videos. One of his main findings is the importance of the relevancy of pop culture references, including jokes and memes. As such, he keeps an eye on mainstream channels like the previously mentioned PewDiePie and others, trying to relate AI to the timely themes that the youth find entertaining.Perhaps the most controversial of all, however, are his educational rap videos. Admittedly, listening to someone spit fire about data science with gorgeous women and fast cars in the background feels a little uncanny at first, but this is exactly the point. In Siraj‚Äôs world, it shouldn‚Äôt. With hip-hop surpassing rock music as the most listened to genre in the US, he believes the genre to be a perfect medium for spreading technical knowledge to the youth. Moreover, he utilizes rap as a mnemonic device, getting informative verses such as this stuck in people‚Äôs minds:‚ÄúInput times weight, it‚Äôs a matrix of numbs, add a bias, activate.‚ÄùIn addition to creating his own material, he also acts as an advisor of sorts, trying to get his message into the heads of celebrities. In a podcast, he tells a story of a time he went to a high-end club in Los Angeles, for the sole purpose of educating popular rappers like Drake about AI. It seems to be working, too. For example, Jaden Smith‚Äôs recent work ‚ÄúA Calabasas Freestyle‚Äù, watched over 2 million times in YouTube, enjoys the following lyrics:‚ÄúTen black sheep deep, they just want us to blend in (Oh),that‚Äôs what the neural net will say when the AI is sentient.‚ÄùAs for the future, Siraj is thinking about publishing books, coming out with an album, and starring in a Netflix show. Even fashion isn‚Äôt out of the question, he says. To him, these disparate mediums are just like different keys in the piano, different instruments in the orchestra of education. And just like the pop stars of today, Siraj, too, knows it‚Äôs less about your voice, and more about your twerk.",18/07/2019,1,0,0,1,1050,465,1,0,0,0,206

Put Down Your Phone And Thank Me Later,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/put-down-your-phone-and-thank-me-later-1b63a827c82a,"Melody Wilding, LMSW",69000,4,658,"Have you ever noticed that no one looks up while crossing the street anymore? Most people are too busy responding to text messages or scrolling through social media to pay attention to their surroundings.Truth be told, I‚Äôm guilty of this myself. But nevertheless, it defies all logic. Why do we risk our safety to check if someone liked our latest Facebook update? Can‚Äôt it wait for later, say, maybe when you‚Äôre not near oncoming traffic?It‚Äôs a fact of modern-day life: we can‚Äôt live without our devices. In fact, a recent Gallup poll revealed that the average adults checks their smartphone hourly, if not every few minutes. Americans‚Äô attachment to their phones is so strong that 63 percent of people actually sleep with their phone right next to them.While technology has tremendous upsides, it becomes a problem if you use it to procrastinate, numb out, or run from problems.Changing your digital habits starts with understanding how technology changes your brain and behavior.It‚Äôs no secret that technology has the ability to hook us with endless opportunities to play, learn and connect. But why do we go too far? Why do we spend hours staring at our phones, browsing social media or answering emails?It comes down to understanding operant conditioning, which describes how our behavior is shaped by consequences. What we do depends on the rewards or punishments associated with an action. Put simply, if something feels good or benefits us, we do more of it.One of the most surprising findings of operant conditioning is that if you want to train an animal to do something, rewarding them consistently is not the best way to do it. What‚Äôs more effective is to give the animal a reward sometimes, and at random intervals ‚Äî what‚Äôs known as intermittent reinforcement.Intermittent reinforcement is at the root of technology obsession. It‚Äôs the behavioral undercurrent that keeps you compulsively checking your device.For example, when you refresh your inbox, sometimes (but not every time) you have a new message. You never know for sure when a new message will come in (the reward), so the habit of checking all the time is reinforced. Same goes for getting new notifications or updates on social media.Intermittent reinforcement also explains how you end up wasting hours on your phone. Every reward gives you a boost to the pleasure centers of the brain that reinforce the behavior and keep you going further down the rabbit hole.If you want to spend less time on your phone and more time living your life, here are some tips to try.Take notice of the mental and emotional states that drive you to compulsively reach for your phone. Are you bored? Procrastinating on starting a hard project? Avoiding an uncomfortable feeling of awkwardness at a tense dinner?Research shows high-intensity emotions like anger and frustration can lead to distraction, so pay attention to what situations or people trigger you the most.Armed with this self-awareness consider other ways you respond or deal with the situation besides burying your head in your device. Your goal isn‚Äôt to eliminate the emotions, rather brainstorm alternative ways of acting that better serve you.Ask yourself these three questions:Asking yourself these questions can help you identify whether your technology habits are leading you to success or holding you back.Defining new boundaries around technology is the final step in freeing yourself from the cycle of smartphone obsession. For example, you may choose to not check email after 6 pm. However, if your job requires you to be on-call, you might instead create a boundary by removing social media apps from your phone so you don‚Äôt get distracted.By creating proactive guidelines that explicitly spell out when, how, and why you will (or will not) engage with your device, you are accepting personal responsibility for bringing your goals and priorities to life, instead of being bossed around by your phone.Liked this article?

What is cybersquatting? And why is it a BIG deal?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-cybersquatting-and-why-is-it-a-big-deal-123634b23c17,Ax Sharma,739,7,1558,"Domain squatting, also known as cybersquatting is the practice of buying domain names which sound important, marketable or are valuable to an entity, without putting them to a bona-fide use.We do it all the time. Organisations do it to protect their trademark and brand image. For example, Facebook.com likely owns Facebook.org and .net. Domain ‚Äòbrokers‚Äô make thousands to millions by ‚Äòreserving‚Äô high value domains, such as the two-letter ev.com (I totally guessed that one).Some companies even take a step forward in an attempt to protect their image by buying potentially negative-sounding domain names for example, company-name-sucks.com. And you would probably be wise to do so. After all, domain squatting didn‚Äôt spare even the White House! Just look at the satirical Whitehouse.org ‚Äî although it is being actively used for a purpose rather than sitting idle for a desperate buyer who may appear someday.If you own MaryAnnCosmetics in Canada and expect to expand in the British market in near future, it may be smart to secure both MaryAnnCosmetics.ca and (.co).uk for a mere ¬£10 before somebody else does. If you expect to go big, maybe even secure MaryAnnCosmeticsScam.tld among other potentially damaging names.If you are Bank of England or any entity dealing even remotely with money, you better squat all variants of your domain name e.g. bank-of-england, bank-ofengland, bank.ofengland and so on to prevent hackers and scammers from conducting phishing attacks.If you are a victim of cybersquatting ‚Äî that is your dream name is already taken, there are some ways around it.If you know the concept of domain hacking ‚Äî i.e. playing with some concatenation of different TLDs, which is basically what del.icio.us did before they could procure delicious.com, you would know that not getting a plain old ‚Äú.com‚Äù domain for your dream company, or having to pay thousands to secure it can definitely be a bummer, but it certainly is not the end of the world.Another workaround could be adding a short, agile verb to your choice of name. So if your app is called ‚Äúhug‚Äù, a domain name variant of gethug or tryhug might be available even when hug.com isn‚Äôt.Bear in mind, even though such workarounds exist, they may have a detrimental impact on your SEO ranking ‚Äî especially in the initial stages, which is when you likely need the most SEO.To elaborate with an example, say you were the founder of a startup, FastPizza. Maybe ‚Äúfastpizza.com‚Äù was taken and you were smart enough to apply some domain hacking skills to get ‚Äúfastpiz.za‚Äù instead. Now this is pretty cool, but would Google show this result primarily in Zambia only, given the ‚Äú.za‚Äù TLD? We don‚Äôt know. Perhaps a lot of proprietary SEO algorithms would assume that a ‚Äú.za‚Äù domain is best targeted towards Zambian users only, even if Google‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt.Years ago, when I had founded Securesque Ltd., UK üá¨üáß, I was the owner of the domain which has now been squatted, as I didn‚Äôt bother renewing it, purposely so ‚Äî and what I had purchased for just $10 is now apparently worth a few thousand dollars.Given the intangible nature of a domain name; its value largely vested in its vanity, these price figures are largely arbitrarily made up of course, and therefore negotiable. I would advise anyone going domain-shopping not to hesitate negotiating the price down over the phone. Chances are you‚Äôll get it for 25‚Äì30% less than the listed price easily. Yes, I have done this in the past and successfully so.But what happens when this practice is abused for censoring?For example, let‚Äôs say I own MensHealthClub.com, a men‚Äôs fitness club franchise, and decide to squat WomensHealthClub.com, GayMensHealthClub.com, and TransHealthClub.com. By law and by ICANN‚Äôs guidelines, as long as I‚Äôm not violating anyone‚Äôs trademarks or ‚Äòsquatting‚Äô the domain with intentions ICANN considers bad, I‚Äôm perfectly within my rights. I can even buy this domain with the intention of ‚Äòselling‚Äô it to someone someday for a profit, or for ‚Äòsupposedly‚Äô starting my own venture WomensHealthClub one day without having a solid, upfront plan.You see? There are legitimate use cases making this practice hard to regulate.But things get interesting in some cases. What if I wanted to squat WomensHealthClub.com to stifle competition; the very possibility of a competing chain arising which gears the same services towards women?Her Campus is an online magazine for American collegiate women featuring articles on college experience from a female perspective for its readers who would at large undoubtedly be female. Her Campus currently owns (squats) HisCampus.com. Ironically, HisCampus.com, as opposed to going nowhere or showing an idle page redirects to HerCampus.com.The Forbes article reads:Though Her Campus does own hiscampus.com, they have no plans to move into the male-dominated space.I did notice their attitude towards having a ‚ÄòHis Campus‚Äô is dismissive and a mockery at best (archived here). One of their authors basically presumes that people wouldn‚Äôt need a ‚ÄòHis Campus‚Äô. But either way, you are controlling a vast market by simply squatting a domain.I can‚Äôt tell if this was done purposely or by accident but it is censorship.In practice, the people behind Her Campus have ensured a competing product tailored towards a different demographic can‚Äôt come to existence. It seems they are either prematurely threatened about something that HisCampus.com may be used for or just forgot about the domain altogether.Yes, somebody could acquire his-campus.com (notice the dash) and looks like somebody already has in the past, the SEO ranking of this domain name and the name choice in itself would not look as elegant as the non-hyphenated counterpart. Imagine having to tell your prospects and friends, ‚ÄúGuys, check out my new website, his dash campus!‚ÄùThere is a reason we have both MensHealth and WomensHealth magazines ‚Äî those markets very much exist and the magazines clearly target audiences from different demographics. I personally don‚Äôt see anything wrong with targeting different audiences ‚Äî it‚Äôs a valid practice in business. But if you are going to simply squat a trademark or domain name and not really be using it, how fair is it?On many occasions, the FBI has boasted its glorious overpowering authority when it has seized domains under the pretence of ‚Äúcopyright infringement‚Äù among others. We heard of the Megaupload.com scandal and seizure, only to become aware of a revived Mega.nz, founded by the same Kim Dotcom.Who‚Äôd have known that the federal ‚Äî not international law-enforcement arm of the U.S. government ‚Äî a government which, according to some, has mostly failed at anything would be so concerned about copyright? To me, this was nothing other than finding a skeleton in Kim Dotcom‚Äôs closet ‚Äî an excuse to get him for something more grave through an overwhelming display of power. One is but tempted to think doesn‚Äôt the FBI ‚Äî an organisation not even dedicated to enforcing laws outside the U.S., has better things to do than track illegal downloads?Many more domains have been seized by governments in the past ‚Äî whether for legitimate reasons or for censorship, although without stating the latter as the official reason.Finally, what is fair game and what are the rules, if any?Even though I have always preferred the internet being a free space with minimal regulation, domain squatting is truly a bothersome practice which can be abused: from profiteering from ‚Äòcatchy sounding‚Äô names to hurting startups by grabbing these names early on and pricing them exorbitantly to censoring domains you see as a threat to your establishment ‚Äî political, religious, dogmatic, or otherwise.And then there are very legitimate use cases of the practice as well.From trademark and brand image protection to offering country-specific variants of your service: think in terms of google.cn, google.in, google.fr, ‚Ä¶.ICANN and IANA, the regulatory authorities ‚Äî rather non-profit parent organisations behind the world‚Äôs domain names and IPs, currently maintain their own policies regarding domain registration, cybersquatting, and dispute resolution. They often do so in conjunction with a country‚Äôs government who gets to somewhat define yet their own rules, pertaining to the use of domain names comprising the TLDs of that country. So, back to the fastpiz.za example: Zambian government would have some additional authority over this name due to the .za TLD.The super-rich and influential, like Barclays, just get their own .barclays TLDs by paying ICANN off and in effect are bypassing a lot of barriers. But no one is exempt from the Supremes: ICANN and IANA.ICANN and IANA are headquartered in the U.S. This means, the laws and authority of the U.S. government virtually dominate the world wide web and all of the domains in existence. There is some leeway and rules do vary, for example, to buy a .eu TLD domain name, you need to have a legitimate business or be trading in a European country. These restrictions greatly reduce the possibility of domain squatting. A U.S.-based or Australian domain broker, in that case, can no longer ‚Äòsquat‚Äô a .EU domain without a bona-fide intent of trading within Europe.Still, at the end of the day, the virtual world of domains remains a vastly unregulated space with enough loopholes and possibilities to acquire a fancy domain name for mere $9.95 and sell it for a whopping $50 million.The question isn‚Äôt if cybersquatting is a big deal, but with so much ambiguity in the space, so much money involved, and the potential for abuse, who gets to decide what is fair game, and what even is fair game?¬© 2019.

KFC Won the Battle for China,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/kfc-won-the-battle-for-china-475ed045b03e,Jordan Fraser,4300,6,977,"When you walk the streets of any major Chinese city today, you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that the bustling sight of foreign businesses on every street corner must have always been the norm.I‚Äôm kidding, you are not forgiven. Read a book.Western businesses spread across China is actually relatively new. Before KFC there were absolutely zero fast food restaurants in China of any kind.Rewind history to 1987 and America‚Äôs Kentucky Fried Chicken becomes the first fast food restaurant in the country when it opened its first Chinese restaurant in Beijing.A big part of what made this expansion such a visionary business decision is because of the timing.The late 80‚Äôs was the moment that China unshackled itself from the restrictions of former government decisions.Businesses were finally able to set their own pricing. Farmers were being allowed the freedom to decide what they should grow, and the country as a whole began to shift focus from starvation mode, to mass global scale production.This relaxation of policy made it legal and possible for foreign businesses to invest in China, so KFC jumped at the chance and didn‚Äôt just introduce their business to Chinese consumers, they crushed business with Chinese consumers.Right before opening their first store in China in 1987, KFC unveiled a menu of China specific options.Many businesses since then have done this, but arguably none took the time and conducted the research to do it as well as KFC has.The first friends I made in China all those eons ago made my journey incredible by showing me around Shanghai and introducing me to the most beautiful local sites.They took me ‚Äúoff the beaten track‚Äù and to locations that would otherwise be difficult to find, including to a beautiful and historically significant tea ceramony.One stop I did not expect was to a KFC.One friend of mine is absolutely addicted to the egg tarts (shown above) and couldn‚Äôt let a day go by without having one.Another friend has had soy milk everyday since childhood, a beverage that is very commonly consumed in China. (Not just by the lactose intolerant).This menu is tailor made for the Chinese consumer, not just the types of options, but the quality.Here‚Äôs where I may get some pushback from some people, and I understand that everyone has their own opinion. When I bite into a KFC egg tart, it is crispy and crumbly on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.It‚Äôs perfect.I can‚Äôt stand the chicken though.Everything on the menu is bloody spicy, and most of the options are so unusual to me that I‚Äôd never venture to try it outside of a dare. But it‚Äôs not for me, and thats the point.At the time that KFC came to China, it was known as nasty fast-food everywhere else in the world. But China was poor at the time, and meat was a rare treat, not an everyday staple. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon at the time to add a squirt of meat-paste to a bowl of rice to beef up the protein.So when KFC rolled into town with giant chicken pieces in every meal... How could it fail?Meat that was previously hard to find was now within easy grasp. The timing was perfect.From 1 store in 1987 ‚Äî to 300+ stores in 1999, growth was explosive.And by the time McDonalds rolled into town, KFC had a firm and unshakable foothold with the public.According to market research conducted by ‚ÄòChina Market Research Group‚Äô a big mistake McDonalds made was not taking the same approach of tailoring the menu to the taste of the Chinese consumers.They rolled into town with the same menu that worked in America and expected the same results.McDonalds turned up with an American menu and an advertising campaign that marketed itself as the best choice for kids... In a country still dealing with the effects of the one child policy.YikesWith families not choosing restaurants based on what the kids wanted, and McDonalds targeting their marketing at kids; they really shot themselves in the foot right out the gate.Getting into town in the exact right moment and building a market-specific menu gave KFC the edge. After that, they needed to expand.KFC built locations all over China and chose storefronts that would be in ideal walking paths to consumers heading to and coming from work.They went to towns where no-one had ever gone before and did it long before McDonalds or anyone else.By the time anyone else came to town, the public were use to the sight and the taste of KFC.Educating a market is no easy task, and once China learned the taste of KFC chicken, there was no going back.As of last year, KFC has double the amount of stores in China over McDonalds, and 10 times the amount of Burger King.A combination of timing, taste and expansion has given them an enormous leg up thats possibly going to be impossible for anyone to ever beat.They‚Äôre also changing with the times.K Pro is a healthy version of KFC created by KFC China‚Äôs parent company, Yum China.K Pro doesn‚Äôt sell fried chicken and doesn‚Äôt feature any of KFC‚Äôs iconic red branding.They sell quinoa, salmon salad sandwiches and many other Chinese specific, healthy options in a table service style restaurant.Options include several different salads and lots of seafood options. They also offer fruit juices and beer, and a few less healthy chicken options marketed as ‚Äúsnacks.‚ÄùKFC has come further and is doing more in China than perhaps anywhere else in the world, and it‚Äôs paying off. They‚Äôre innovating constantly to stay ahead of changing consumer habits and stay relevent.KFC is now the place to go for a healthy salad or some fresh seafood.While McDonalds continues to be the place to go for a greasy burger, they‚Äôre going to keep falling ever behind. Especially in a country thats not really a big lover of burgers in the first place.medium.commedium.com",18/07/2019,1,0,10,10,981,661,6,0,0,12,60
Every review counts: a quick guide to responding to customer feedback,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/every-review-counts-a-quick-guide-to-responding-to-customer-feedback-698ed314dbb5,Aytekin Tank,59000,9,1324,"That‚Äôs how many customers say online reviews factor into their buying decisions.90% read online reviews before visiting a business.88% trust these reviews to help them decide on their purchase.And 84% trust online reviews just as much as a personal recommendation.Don‚Äôt have any reviews? 8% of customers don‚Äôt care.The other 92%? They care quite a lot.‚Ä¶. I could go on. After all, I‚Äôm the first person to scour a restaurant‚Äôs Tripadvisor before booking a table, or scroll through user comments before investing in a new gadget. Aren‚Äôt we all?These statistics are unsurprising today, when a company‚Äôs online reputation can be its greatest advantage ‚Äî or its biggest liability. Even Apple aren‚Äôt immune to the power of the people.Companies can try and convince users of the value of their product; but nothing carries as much weight as the words of people who aren‚Äôt paid to say them. Consumers trust other consumers more than they will ever trust us.That‚Äôs why a word-of-mouth endorsement is the best form of marketing; but online reviews come a close second.When we start a business, something that we‚Äôve poured our heart and soul into is on the line for praise and criticism. Customer feedback can be wonderful. And it can be painful. Either way, it matters.Good reviews are good news, naturally.But the story doesn‚Äôt end there.Yep, even the most awful ones.They reflect what we do right, what we get wrong, and what our blind spots are.And reviews are not the last word.No matter how awesome our product, how thoughtful our customer service team, we can never achieve a completely clean slate with no negative feedback; in fact, it would actually be a little weird if we did.We can‚Äôt control what people say about us, and we certainly shouldn‚Äôt delete bad reviews when they inevitably appear.What we can control is our response.In fact, how we react to a review matters just as much as the review itself.Because our response is a snapshot of something much bigger: our values, our service, our personality, our brand.A snapshot visible to millions of people.So, what kind of impression do we want to make?Let‚Äôs face it: most responses to online reviews are pretty generic. That‚Äôs why the way in which we reply is a chance for us to stand out, and lend a human element to a static online interaction.A warm, thoughtful response can have the same impact as a smile and a one-to-one conversation.Of course, our level of formality will depend on the review. And of course, there isn‚Äôt a go-to method that works for everyone.That being said, all responses will benefit from these pointers:Addressing people by their name (whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄòKatie‚Äô or ‚Äòilovewine2001‚Äô) and signing off with your own will strengthen the connection and make customers feel valued. In the case of a serious complaint, offer a way of continuing the conversation in private.Here‚Äôs something obvious (and yet often overlooked): thanking our customer for taking the time to share their thoughts. Full stop.Jargon, lofty mannerisms, convoluted sentences? Resist. They build barriers, and it‚Äôs hard to get a point across in overly-complex territory. It pays off to keep word choice simple and sentences short. Ask yourself: is this how I would speak to someone in real life?Repetition is boring. Automated replies are super-boring. Both are kind of offensive in this context. Copying and pasting the same reply says ‚Äúthis review is so unimportant to us that we couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to give you an individual response‚Äù.Other things that will make your customer‚Äôs eyes glaze over: broad statements, abstractions, generalizations. Picking up on specifics shows a customer that they‚Äôve been heard.God is in the detail. Good customer service is too.Ouch. No matter who it comes from, negative feedback hurts. It‚Äôs hard not to take it personally.Behind the keyboard, people are often more ruthless than they would be in real life.That‚Äôs why negative online reviews are a triple whammy. They sting, they‚Äôre harsh ‚Äî and they‚Äôre public.Who wouldn‚Äôt want to defend themselves in this kind of situation? Many companies do. Hint: it doesn‚Äôt work.Being defensive will not just alienate the customer who wrote the critical review, but also all others reading it.So where is the opportunity?It‚Äôs a two-way conversation, remember. Your reply can change the customer‚Äôs mind ‚Äî and everyone else‚Äôs in the process‚Ä¶.‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôm ‚Äòsorry‚Äô‚Äù, drawls the moody teenager, ‚ÄúBut I want you to say sorry and MEAN IT,‚Äù replies the despairing parent.That parent has a point.‚ÄòWe‚Äôre sorry for the inconvenience‚Äô or ‚Äòwe apologize for the issue you had‚Äô are the least sorry-sounding apologies ever.They say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry that YOU had a problem (a problem for which we accept zero accountability, by the way) ‚Äù. They are the verbal equivalent of sticking your head in the sand. Not a good strategy.The alternative? Take full responsibility. Let your apology reflect that you a) accept the issue b) will resolve it and c) will ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen again.A customer writing a negative review feels aggrieved and may sound adversarial. You want to change this.A reply that is genuinely warm and considerate will take the wind out of the angry customer‚Äôs sails.Fetching coffees, fact-checking‚Ä¶ there are plenty of tasks that should be passed down the ranks. Replying to negative reviews isn‚Äôt one of them.An apology will carry more weight when it comes from a higher echelon. The involvement of a senior staff member shows that we take an issue seriously.Many negative reviews arise from confusion on the part of the customer rather than a mistake on the part of the company. No need to point the finger, though; just politely clarify the situation, and offer a solution.Sometimes resolving the issue means offering something extra: a discount, a freebie, an invitation to come in and chat. This kind of response creates loyalty.Or, the magic words: ‚ÄúHow can we make it up to you?‚ÄùPutting the ball in the dissatisfied customer‚Äôs court gives them the chance to become constructive.This is a tricky one. Take too long to respond and the unhappy customer (plus anyone else who‚Äôs reading) may think we are trying to sweep the bad review under the carpet by ignoring them.But if we are too hasty, our spur-of-the-moment response can be overly emotional ‚Äî or factually incomplete.So, before you respond, hit the pause button. Make sure you‚Äôve got the full picture. Jot down your thoughts. This way, you can be sure your reply is accurate, considered and helpful to everyone involved.Bad reviews‚Ä¶Most companies understand the need to react to negative reviews, if only to fight fires and limit the damage.But many will neglect to respond to positive reviews. These customers are already on our side, so why bother? Here‚Äôs why: you could turn fans into brand ambassadors.Thanking customers who already love our business is a win-win tactic. They feel appreciated, which will strengthen their loyalty. We just get a free referral, so why not express our appreciation?A few suggestions.If someone can be bothered to write something awesome about us online, we can be pretty sure they will be saying nice things about us to their friends, too.And nothing we say about our brand is going to carry as much weight as what someone non-affiliated says for free. Because great reviews = effective, free advertising.With so much noise online, reviews from real people tend to be much more warmly received than generic marketing.We can leverage the power of our best reviews by cross-promoting them or integrating them with our social media platforms. This is a powerful way to re-engage users and increase social conversion rates.Google pulls data from external online review sites to create its search results; the more positive reviews we have over as many platforms as possible, the more effective our rankings, organic traffic and ads will be.So, it‚Äôs not just about having great reviews ‚Äî it‚Äôs about having lots of great reviews.You can set up a personalized review form in a couple of minutes using a free form builder like the one here. No fuss or coding required.",18/07/2019,1,0,15,12,421,395,11,3,0,21,551
Who Wants To Be A Unity Developer?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/who-wants-to-be-a-unity-developer-8a5cd11868b6,Daniel Zolnai,54,11,2225,"We at Egeniq were asked by RTL Nederland to make a companion game for their new game show on TV, BankGiro Miljonairs (the dutch version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?).This article will sum up the positive and negative aspects of using Unity while I have worked on this application.The game contains almost 2,000 questions, to which you have to answer within the given time. The quicker you are, the more points you get. As you get higher and higher on the prize ladder, it gets more difficult.Visuals of the game are very similar to the TV programme: it is essentially a 2D game rendered in 3D, to give the user a sense of depth (elements on the screen coming closer or going further away).The game for the TV show has already been available on some markets, and RTL got the license for the source code from Sony, so the majority of the time was spent on customizing the game to a more modern look and extending with some minor features, such as sharing of the final score, or user handling.When I opened the project in Unity, it asked if I want to migrate my project to my Unity version, because it was last edited in an earlier version. After confirming, and waiting about a minute, the app was ready to be compiled.First compilation of the app takes perhaps a minute or so, but incremental builds after that are a lot quicker. After I make my changes in the code, and I press on the big play button, within 5 seconds I can start playing the game, inside the editor! No deploying to any device needed, and I can resize the preview window to match the screen size of an iPhone 5S or an iPad Pro.My first impressions were quite good, but how did Unity fare on the long term?The first hurdle came when we wanted to integrate the app into our Continuous Integration (and Delivery) tool, Buildozer. Buildozer does not support Unity projects (as of now), so as a first workaround, I just exported the Android and iOS project after each pull request, and commanded Buildozer to build from the directories containing the exported project.This worked, but resulted in a lot of overhead ‚Äî in manual labor and also in diffs: I had to export the iOS and Android project manually with each pull request, and the pull requests looked mostly like this:Also, a lot of these binary files change frequently, and are quite large, so the overall size of the git repo was increasing in an alarming rate. Soon, it would take a coffee break to clone the repository for someone else (or the CI tool).So I had to find an alternative solution.Since I have already achieved a working build with this workaround, I started investigating if we could export the projects automatically on the Buildozer nodes after checkout. It is possible to write scripts, which you then can invoke via your command line to export the project. But it has one main problem: it requires the Unity executable for the invocation, and the Buildozer Android builders run on Linux, which is not supported by Unity. So I started looking into other options.Then I found Unity Cloud Build. It is exactly what I was looking for, it can build and distribute (via a share link) Android and iOS apps built from a repository. The pricing pages are very misleading, they state it requires Unity Teams Advanced, and when you follow the link, it says with large letters that you get Teams Advanced free with Unity Pro.From our experience, that‚Äôs not true, because although we had a Pro account, we could not add any repositories to Cloud Build until we purchased Team Advanced separately (which at $9 a month is at a quite fair price, but still).I added our project to Unity Cloud Build, and it worked within an hour for both platforms. It has its quirks, like long build times and missing features (I can‚Äôt remove my old iOS signing credentials, only add extra ones‚Ä¶), but it does its job.Most newcomers to Unity are curious about how the platform handles iOS and Android at the same time. The two differ a lot in their API‚Äôs and app lifecycle states, and I can say that Unity abstracts these quite well.By default, you write your code in C#. You can also use async-await, which you will probably use a lot, such as for network requests, or just waiting for an animation to end.For common tasks, Unity has convenience methods. For opening a URL in the browser, you just call: Application.OpenURL(url);Or to play a fullscreen video: Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie(‚Äúintro.mp4‚Äù, Color.black, FullScreenMovieControlMode.CancelOnInput);If you need different behavior on platforms, you can use the platform directives:But what if you need to interact with the platform API‚Äôs, and there‚Äôs no Unity convenience wrapper for them? Luckily, you can also interop between Unity and the platform-dependent Java or Objective-C code by calling methods on them via C#.When you import a plugin via a package, it usually consists of the Android jar file the iOS framework, and the wrapper for both in C# which calls the underlying Android or iOS function depending on the current platform.About the packages, I have a mixed feeling. They are not really packages, but a collection of directories and files zipped together. When you open the package in Unity, it just asks if you want all of them imported in your project. So now you have a bunch of extra source and asset files cluttering your project.Also, Unity has a lot of magic directories. If you put a file in Assets/Plugins/Android, it will only be included in the Android build (same for iOS). If you have a directory called Editor (anywhere in your project), you can create a special C# class with some annotations on it, and voil√°, now you have an extra menu item in the top toolbar of Unity!I have to admit, sometimes this comes handy. Like when the Fabric Unity plugin crashes on startup, you can just remove one of the plugin resource files to make it work again.It is one of those with great power comes great responsibility moments.Unity knows about this too, and they are pushing their package manager more and more. It helps in finding which packages the files belong to, listing the installed versions of the packages, and providing an ability to uninstall all files belonging to a plugin, or updating an existing version. This is the way to go in my opinion, but most of the packages are not distributed through this manager. Unity should be pushing this more, and creators publicizing via here or the asset store.There are also these special classes called build scripts. They are regular C# classes with some special annotations, which makes Unity call the methods on them after you build the app, when you can move around and edit files in the build product.They are essential to large projects, because sooner or later you will need to make edits to a plist, or move a file to a different path.My first task with the game was is to get it working on Android (it was iOS only before). When you ran it on Android, it would crash at the first database operation, because it could not find libsqlite3. The solution appeared to be including the precompiled libsqlite3.so, and by placing it into one of the magic directories which adds it to the Android build only.These workarounds with magic directories and build scripts used to be regular, when including libraries in the project.I already mentioned that I had to apply a workaround to get the Fabric plugin working in Unity (aside from that, it works great!).Sadly, it seems to be a pattern between libraries that they tend to drop Unity support (or at least, don‚Äôt update they package anymore).For example, Adobe Mobile Analytics has not updated their Unity package since October 2016. You need to apply a few workarounds (including 2 post-build scripts) to get it working properly. I listed those in this gist, to help people attempting to do the same.If you think you can avoid the plugins, you will be mistaken. For example, Unity supports serializing JSON from text into objects. Sadly, this is just a very basic implementation, since it does not support mapping aliases, it can only match the JSON keys to the exact same variable names.So when you have a JSON key with a dash (-) in it or if it starts with a number, you have to switch to a library to work around this limitation (I highly recommend JsonDotNet).Or if you just want to share a text on a button click, you are better off with a plugin, because writing the same code yourself could take days.Now, let‚Äôs get on with the visuals. The game elements are built together with the 2D Toolkit. When I was working on the project, the last version was already 2 years old, and had problems with the stable version of Unity. Luckily it did not break the app, it only made editing files harder, and I see that there is a new release available now, which promises compatibility with newer Unity versions (but it is still one major version behind).As you may already know, Unity uses OpenGL to draw the game onto your screen. To get an image or text onto the screen, you can‚Äôt just drag-and-drop them onto a screen (you can with Panels, but those are for UI use only, not recommended for game use).With the 2D toolkit, to get your images onto the screen, you first have to compile them into a sprite collection. You select all the images you want to include, and then compile them together. In the background, this creates a special PNG file called an atlas, which contains all the images cramped together.Now if you create a sprite, you can look up an image from the atlas. In the game, this atlas will be loaded as an OpenGL texture, and the individual sprites will be cut from them when required.When you instantiate these sprites with the 2D Toolkit, they all have a GameObject attached. GameObject is the object I was interacting with the most during the game. Using its transform property I can modify its position, rotation or scale or even color. When you delete the GameObject, it is also removed from the screen.If you want to display text, well that‚Äôs also not that easy as it may seem. You have to compile your font into a so-called Signed Distance Field format, which converts your font to an atlas of images containing all the letters, numbers and special characters in your font. So the characters are also mapped back from a texture. Since your font is not in a vector format anymore, the quality loss will be visible if you scale the font size up too much. So you have to save it with larger individual image sizes, but that results in larger app sizes again.Finally, if you have everything working in the editor, it is time to test and deploy to the physical devices your app was designed to run on. Unity supports a broad selection of platforms, which makes it very appealing if you want to write a game once, and distribute it to as many people as possible.For Android, you can build a .apk with two clicks, or export to a Gradle project, which you can open in Android Studio. The iOS option creates an Xcode project, where you can then archive the product (note that you can also build for simulators, but first you need to change your Target SDK setting to Simulator).Once built, I noticed that the .apk and .ipa are quite large in size, this is because the 2D Toolkit atlas files are very large, and consume a lot of space. This could be improved in the future by spending time in optimizing the atlas, or the texture compression settings.Once the app was available to the public, we noticed that Unity has really low crash rates (1 in around 10.000 sessions, which is really good for a first version). I am very happy about this since no one wants to debug issues happening in interpreted C# code with minimal stack traces üòäOn iOS, we got so many downloads the second day that it jumped to the 2nd place within its category on the second day after the release!To me, working with Unity is fun and frustrating at the same time. It is tedious in the beginning, when you add a new plugin, or want to get to know a feature / tool of Unity better, because documentation and ‚ÄúStackOverflow support‚Äù is not as good as it would be with Android or iOS. But once you have it working, it does its job surprisingly well.In the end, the Editor, iOS, and Android rendered exactly the same way, with good speed and quality too, as they should be.It is interesting to see how far mobile cross-platform has come, and Unity is for sure is something to be considered for a game. Although I cannot determine how it fares for true 3D, computing- and rendering intensive games, the tooling and features did not left me unsatisfied.If you reside in the Netherlands, feel free to try the game out on Android or iOS.",18/07/2019,0,1,0,13,610,413,11,0,0,17,114

Diversity to Inclusion: 9 Steps You Can Take to Unlock Your Company‚Äôs Competitive Edge (Pt. 1),The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/diversity-to-inclusion-9-steps-to-unlock-competitive-edge-pt-1-c5954c113a49,Dalia Katan,37,8,1735,"Diversity in the workplace is often described as a double-edged sword: it may pose a risk for conflict or give organizations an incredible competitive edge. The key to unlocking that competitive edge? Inclusion.Diversity and inclusion (D&I) are more than just a box to check to boost a company‚Äôs social brand; it‚Äôs good business, for any business. Diverse teams are more creative, productive, and innovative, and are better at problem-solving and decision-making because of the variety of perspectives and experiences represented. By including individuals from diverse and intersectional backgrounds, companies can better understand their market, mitigate unconscious bias, and enhance marketing efforts, helping them win in an increasingly diverse, global, and socially conscious marketplace. And here‚Äôs the icing on the cake ‚Äî D&I also enables companies to:With all that said, it‚Äôs no surprise that diverse companies are 35% more likely to financially outperform the market ‚Äî if properly managed through a culture of inclusion. Moral of the story? Companies that want to succeed in the future of work will need to make D&I a business priority or they will get left behind.Last year, I launched Deloitte‚Äôs Refugee Workplace Integration program with the Tent Partnership for Refugees to research how employers could nurture the talents of minorities in the workplace, specifically focusing on refugee and immigrant populations. We found that top-performing companies focused on inclusion as a core company value, rather than diversity as a number. After all, successful workplace inclusion is more than just a hiring decision; it‚Äôs a commitment to fostering a culture that unlocks the full potential of each individual in a team.Top-performing companies focused on inclusion as a core company value, rather than diversity as a number. After all, successful workplace inclusion is more than just a hiring decision.We compiled dozens of leading D&I practices across six key parts of the talent lifecycle that benefit not only refugee and immigrant employees, but employees of all types of backgrounds. Here are some of the lessons we found in three of those key areas.Note: Diversity is intersectional. In addition to gender, diversity encompasses race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic class, life experiences, ideology, personality, and other key characteristics. This means that many people have overlapping identities that don‚Äôt just tick one box!Minority representation is disproportionately found in entry-level roles, and in order to be truly inclusive, it‚Äôs important for companies to have diverse representation up and down the chain of command. Developing and adapting learning and development programs to support minorities in growing with the business can both drive positive business outcomes and give employees a sense of purpose at work.It‚Äôs important for companies to have diverse representation up and down the chain of command.One company we interviewed, a European food manufacturer, recognized that many of their lineworkers had not gone to high school or college, which limited their ability to grow within the organization despite their strong leadership qualities. To change that, leaders at the company set up informal math classes and other basic skills training to give them the critical skills they needed to both improve their productivity and advance in the workplace.In another case, a U.S.-based tech company launched coding courses and job shadowing programs that enabled employees to temporarily take on new roles, learn new skills, and gain exposure to different career paths so they could decide where they wanted to grow next.Check out these initiatives to support learning and growth in the workplace.1. Skill development and certificationsIn addition to making initial and skills training accessible for all employees, additional programs such two-way cultural training, ongoing learning and development, and certification opportunities can give minority populations the confidence they need to put themselves forward for stretch opportunities. A key point that will make these initiatives stand out is including these courses in the workweek schedule, rather than expecting additional hours outside of work, which may be burdensome for employees with external responsibilities.2. Exposure to growth opportunitiesUnderemployment is especially common in immigrant populations, since a number of conditions may lead even high-skilled employees to take lower-skilled roles. These roles do have value, such as opportunities for language development and professional advancement, but only when employers are committed to supporting and personalizing the development of those employees beyond that ‚Äòstarting point‚Äô. Skill assessments, conducted early and often, can help employers personalize growth paths for their employees. Showcasing growth stories of other employees, establishing formal mentorship programs, and offering leadership introductions can further advance growth opportunities for minority groups.3. Leadership opportunitiesAs individuals progress in their careers, they can offer meaningful guidance to new employees that join the team. By empowering employees from minority populations to mentor or train new employees, those employees are able to develop new skills, showcase their leadership potential, and gain an increased sense of purpose in their work. Additionally, by creating spaces for them to provide meaningful feedback on areas of improvement for the company and giving them the resources to create change, employers can bring out the entrepreneurial qualities that will showcase and expand employees‚Äô skills, engage them more meaningfully by giving them a stake in the game, and help the business grow and succeed.4. Communication and feedbackFeedback can come in many forms: 360 performance reviews, check-ins between performance review cycles, or informal peer-to-peer feedback in a team. By encouraging frequent feedback and open communication, teams and companies can reinforce a safe space to speak up, ask questions, and offer new and ‚Äúout-there‚Äù ideas. For example, during my time at Deloitte, we were encouraged to check-in with our managers every two weeks to give and receive feedback and adjust course in our projects as needed.Successful D&I programs meet minorities where they are ‚Äî which means preparing the full team with resources to create an inclusive environment. The same European food manufacturer mentioned earlier also realized that many of their employees had been at the company for over 20 years, during which there hadn‚Äôt been any significant change in their hiring and inclusion practices. They created D&I trainings for their staff, including education on the benefits of a more diverse workforce, trainings on cultural differences, and preparation for managers on improving collaboration in a multicultural team.Successful D&I programs meet minorities where they are.These leading practices can help prepare and engage your team to become champions of inclusion.5. Structuring the teamDiverse teams are crucial to a company‚Äôs success in an increasingly fast-changing and unpredictable work. By structuring a balanced and multicultural team and creating productive friction, companies can foster more cross-cultural interactions, increase employee engagement, and unlock many of the performance benefits of a diverse and inclusive team. When building multicultural teams, these placements should be made based on business need, optimizing for where employees can add the most value.6. Building understandingEvery individual has a unique life story ‚Äî and with that comes a variety of positive and challenging circumstances they may have experienced. Celebrating your employee‚Äôs unique differences is a great way to build empathy and cohesion within a team, and further educating employees on the backgrounds and experiences of various minority groups can help enhance that cohesion. D&I trainings and clear expectations from leaders on what they expect from their managers and colleagues can improve cultural awareness from non-minority employees. It can also help them understand the different backgrounds, communication styles, and strengths of their colleagues, and mitigate unproductive friction.One of the managers we interviewed had a practice of taking his team out for a monthly lunch, each time exploring a different cuisine and increasing cultural awareness and storytelling as their workplace grew more diverse. Simple, meaningful gestures like this help build a sense of safety, belonging, and community within organizations, as well as more empathy, understanding, and engagement in day-to-day interactions amongst all employees ‚Äî minorities and non-minorities alike.Try these easy steps today to build cohesion and community in the workplace.7. One-on-one buddy programsOne-on-one buddy programs are an incredibly impactful and easy way to build connection, community, and support. When I was starting off my career at Deloitte, I was assigned a peer buddy ‚Äî an analyst in my group who had been at the firm for 6‚Äì18 months and could be a friend, confidant, and mentor for me through any questions I had. For minority populations who may not have the same level of cultural acclimation or comfort as others, it‚Äôs important to have a buddy to lean on ‚Äî someone who has gone through many of the experiences they will soon go through and who can help them navigate company culture, introduce them to others in their fields of interest, and give them advice during challenges projects.8. Organizational communitiesProfessional, identity-based, and informal social communities present opportunities for employees to have a ‚Äúhome‚Äù outside of their teams, as well as to give feedback to leadership on improvements for their community. At Deloitte, I had joined a women‚Äôs mentorship pod that met every month to talk about life, work, and how we could support one another to lean-in more on leadership opportunities.9. Platforms for storytellingRegular team events, such as shared lunches or dinners, local and cultural holidays, and birthday celebrations, are a great way to build connections, but one additional tweak brings the connection to a deeper level: creating platforms for storytelling and vulnerability. Whether at those events or through newsletters, retreats, or family-inclusive programming, these stories encourage open conversations that can go beyond small-talk or work-talk.Diversity is a tremendously rewarding business investment, for all members of an organization, and when coupled with inclusion, presents a huge competitive advantage. These nine initiatives are a great starting point for unlocking the full impact of inclusion, and since organizations will have varying levels of D&I maturity, each organization can refine and/or develop initiatives based on their changing organizational and workforce needs. From a CEO to an HR leader, manager, or entry-level employee, every employee plays an important role in first understanding the changing needs of their diverse workforce, and then instigating, implementing, and improving inclusion initiatives.I‚Äôd love to hear from you: What initiatives has your organization recently implemented to support a culture of inclusion?

Five Tips for Getting a Remote Job,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/five-tips-for-getting-a-remote-job-ff5517fdc842,Aleksey (Aleks) Weyman,108,6,1107,"Originally published on millennialmoderator.comWe live in an era of optimization and automation. Some people are forecasting a day when robots and algorithms replace work related processes altogether, resulting in a massive loss of jobs in the market. I on the other hand believe that, while many jobs will in fact become automated, there will always be a need for administrative workers to oversee said technology, pushing updates, repairs and of course, always adding that human touch. The beauty of this type of work is that much of it can be done remotely. So let‚Äôs take a look at five tips for how you can get situated in a remote job that will last.In one of our previous Mods, we wrote about five places to find remote jobs online. Today, there are even more (advanced) networks available for browsing remote opportunities and, like most things in life, it pays off to have multiple options. Genie.so is one such resource- a forward thinking remote job finder website that actually sends you jobs that fit your interests, based on a profile you create upon signup. With the revolution of generating income from on-demand & shared-economy services, it has become impossible to know what‚Äôs around us and what is tailored to our own preferences, assets and skills (delivering with DoorDash, renting your car with Turo, tutoring online with SkillShare, etc).With Genie.so, you can find ways to generate income by using your own unique skills and assets, as well as compare various services and plan an optimized work day. After I created an account, I was able to find tons of opportunities with companies like Amazon M Turk, TaskRabbit, EasyShift and more. You can sign up for free and start finding new ways to earn income right on their website.The internet is basically an open source job hiring fair where companies have the benefit of staying anonymous and finding employees from all around the world. In terms of competition, this makes it very hard to stand out, so it‚Äôs quintessential to always be putting your best foot forward and present yourself as the most appealing candidate- at face value. This is where having a portfolio can make you stand out- especially if you are looking for technical or creative related work and can put some of your recent projects on display. Creating a website today is quite easy, in fact you can build a static site using AWS for as low as $0.50/month, here‚Äôs some more information about how to do that.There‚Äôs also the issue of getting found online. If you‚Äôre a freelance web developer looking for your first client, finding you will be like finding a needle in a haystack. SEO is important, and there are tons of companies online that offer SEO optimization services. In my opinion, you need to take it on yourself to rank higher in Google search results. Make sure to have high quality copy, images and design on all of your websites (socials, personal, portfolio, etc). For more information about SEO, here‚Äôs a helpful resource.If you‚Äôre a business consultant, you might not have much luck finding remote work in a community of hobbyist painters (unless they‚Äôre running a moderately successful business). A small business owner community however could be just the place to find your perfect remote job. It‚Äôs all about going to where the customers/users are because that‚Äôs also where other companies are going to evaluate opportunities to improve customer experience. For example the AWS forums are a place for AWS users to ask community questions about their services. Often, AWS support staff will directly engage on these forums and provide solutions, but there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from going in there and providing the support itself- maybe you can land a few freelance clients this way? AWS is, after all, a very popular service.This is all good and great if you work for yourself and are looking to take on new clients, but what about if you‚Äôre looking to join an existing company as a remote worker? There are tons of online communities that function as hiring pools for massive companies. A few places to start looking are Facebook and LinkedIn groups like these. Many of these companies depend on the online consumer and thus are looking to hire people who are internet community-savvy.As times change, so do companies and people. Your old chum from college might just be the CEO of a wildly successful tech company that‚Äôs hiring remote workers. A quick rekindling of old dorm study parties and you could be set up with a prestige referral to the remote finance department- nice! Even if your frat/sorority house roommate isn‚Äôt a tech billionaire by now, they might be working at a remote job company and be able to refer you to join their ranks. There‚Äôs a popular saying that I believe is so true- your network is your net worth! Retaining clients is also huge for independent/freelance workers, as many past clients have an established rapport with you and are more willing to work together again. Just be sure to do a good job of tracking your freelance finances!‚ÄúChange is inevitable‚Äù -that statement doesn‚Äôt hold anywhere more true than in the remote job space. As many of the remote job opportunities involve some sort of technical work, it can be expected that new, emerging technologies will displace current ones. That means staying up to date on the most recent industry trends/practices is an absolute must. There are tons of online, educational resources like Udemy and Teachable (even Fiverr) that provide detailed courses on almost anything that a remote job offer could ask for experience in. You can even get certifications for social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The same is true for highly technical jobs. If you‚Äôve never once parsed a line of code, it‚Äôs not too late to start learning the basics- even if that means getting started on your own.The remote job market is going to continue growing and changing, so long as technology continues to innovate and disrupt entire industries. It‚Äôs not too late to pick up some new skills and begin creating your remote (online) footprint, so take some time to think about what it is you want to do, contribute to some quality online communities, sign up for recommended remote job alerts, and continue to learn new things. I‚Äôll see you in the future.If you enjoyed this Mod, you might also enjoy learning about these other remote job websites. Please share this Mod using the social media icons located on this page.

3 Self-Inflicted Wounds Made by Most Indie Authors,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/3-self-inflicted-wounds-made-by-most-indie-authors-e2ad842bcc31,J.L. Pattison,604,9,1794,"As an author of indie books‚Äîand an occasional reader of indie books‚ÄîI felt compelled to write this brutally honest, open letter to indie authors, even if I receive hate mail for it.There are three failures that keep rearing their ugly heads in far too many self-published books. And as long as authors insist on committing these three self-publishing mistakes, they will keep hurting their book sales, their potential writing careers, and the indie publishing community as a whole.If you‚Äôre an indie author who‚Äôs committing any‚Äîor all three‚Äîof the following self-inflicted wounds, the good news is they can all be remedied.Let‚Äôs examine each of them below.This one drives me crazy. I can forgive a mistake here and there (especially in larger books), but I am shocked at how many self-published books I‚Äôve come across that are rife with misspelling and grammar issues ‚Äî some that are even found on the back cover.So many of these errors could have been caught and fixed had the author employed a professional editor.Much to my chagrin, however, my position on this matter is not an axiom among writers. Here is what one author wrote to me on a social media site regarding the topic:I believe it‚Äôs precisely this attitude that has been partly responsible for earning the self-publishing community a bad name. Why do so many indie authors settle for less, refuse to strive for excellence, and expect readers to lower their expectations?If you can self-edit to the degree of a professional, then you‚Äôre an anomaly and my hat goes off to you, but even the most successful writers use editors because no matter how good we think we are at catching our own mistakes, the sad fact of the matter is, we miss a lot.You need an additional pair of eyes to go over your manuscript with a fine-toothed comb. Even your friends and beta readers will miss errors.The above detractor also took a position that I didn‚Äôt expect from an author, namely that ‚Äúperfect editing does nothing to actually sell the book.‚Äù This is like a restaurant saying ‚Äúsanitary practices do nothing to actually sell the hamburger.‚Äù Perhaps not initially, but how many repeat customers do you expect to serve when your clientele becomes ill after dining at your establishment? You may sell that hamburger today, but if your customer bites down on a toenail in the beef, you can bet you‚Äôll never see that customer again.And you can bet that customer will surely tell their friends about the experience and possibly even leave a poor review on Yelp. In the same way, I‚Äôve seen reviews on Amazon where readers lament the copious spelling and grammar issues they found in a book, some even going so far as to say they put the book down and couldn‚Äôt continue.I don‚Äôt want to be the kind of author that cares more for the initial sale of my book than for establishing a long term reader (fan) of my work. And like any relationship, trust is vital. If readers aren‚Äôt going to like my books, I certainly don‚Äôt want it to be because of toenails in the meat, so seeking out an editor is of utmost importance to me.But how do you find a quality editor who is reasonably priced? I admit, it‚Äôs a challenging task, but do your research and it will pay off in the end.Personally, for my most recent book, I chose editor Jennifer L. Harris. She did a good job and was reasonably priced (compared to other editors) which was a strong selling point on my decision to choose her.If you can‚Äôt afford a professional editor, then wait. Practice a little patience and save up your money until you can afford one.If you won‚Äôt devote the time, money, and effort to ensure high standards in your book‚Äôs content in regards to spelling, grammar, and formatting, should readers expect that your book will be a compelling, well-written story? Short answer: they probably won‚Äôt.And if you approach the writing craft without the desire to provide the best error-free reading experience for the consumer, will readers come back for more? Short answer: probably not.So treat your manuscript like the important life-work that it is. Pay for an editor and polish that masterpiece. You owe it to your readers and you owe it to yourself.The fact is, people do judge books by their covers. I know, because I‚Äôm one of those people.If you‚Äôve ever spent time on a book-selling website, scrolling through the countless books available for purchase, you can surely attest to the fact that there are far too many poorly crafted covers out there.But the solution to this problem is simple. You‚Äôre a writer, not a cover designer, so focus on your writing and leave the cover designing to the professionals.See how simple that was?In this day and age there are many cover designers available to choose from so there‚Äôs no excuse for having an unprofessional book cover. If finances are a concern for you, many of these designers offer pre-made covers at a lower cost than custom designed covers.Here are just a few designers (listed alphabetically) that I‚Äôve personally looked into over the past few years, but there are many more out there:There‚Äôs no way around it, you need a cover for your book and you‚Äôre going to pay for it one way or another. Either up front (for a professional designed cover) or settle for cheap and pay for it later with lost book sales.Personally, the cover designer I selected for my last book was Ivan from Book Covers Art out of England.I went with a custom cover design and Ivan did an impressive job. He was patient and accommodating with my many demands and change requests. The total cost was $250 and this was the final result:I loathe reaching the end of a book only to be left thinking to myself: That was it? What was the point of this story? Why did the author even write this, let alone publish it for public consumption?Reading a dreadful book is a great disappointment to me, not only because my money was wasted, but also because my valuable time was wasted, too. (I can make more money, but I can never get my time back.)If, as an author, you have nothing new, important, or profound to tell, you should ask yourself: Would anyone want to read this? Why would anyone want to read this?People enjoy reading books because they want to learn, grow, laugh, cry, feel, be amused, or escape from the real world. And in some cases, all of the above. If your story does none of these, are you providing sustenance to hungry readers, or are you just adding one more book to an already overflowing ocean of books, making it more difficult for readers to find the stories they actually want to consume?Now this is where some of you will begin formulating your angry response to me. Something along the lines of scolding me for dissuading other writers from writing.Please understand, this is not my intention.I have a collection of my kids‚Äô drawings that adorn my refrigerator at home and my wall at work. Those rudimentary stick figures are all very special to me, but let‚Äôs be real, no one is going to try submitting them to an art museum. You recognize that, my kids understand that, and the art museum appreciates my discernment to not waste their time.Just the same as my kids‚Äô art, I am merely asking for discretion among authors.If someone feels compelled to write, then I say go for it, but remember, not everything that‚Äôs personally meaningful for an author to put on paper will be fit for an audience to consume. Don‚Äôt confuse someone‚Äôs need to write with someone else‚Äôs need to read it. Put out only your best work (even the most successful authors have written stories they never publish).Now, for those of you who are still angry at me because you feel I‚Äôm discouraging writers from publishing their work, has it ever occurred to you that there‚Äôs someone else in this equation that you‚Äôre forgetting about? Have you ever considered how discouraging this is for the reader?Before the advent of self-publishing, it used to be the job of the publishing houses to weed out subpar works. Now readers themselves are stuck doing that job (oftentimes after spending money and their precious time). This is unfair to readers because life is way too short to read bad books.There used to be a time when authors couldn‚Äôt get discovered because the gate keepers at traditional publishing houses were extremely selective. Now, with the advent of self-publishing, anyone and everyone can publish a book (and they do). But where we once couldn‚Äôt get our books into the hands of readers because we couldn‚Äôt get them past the gatekeepers, now we can‚Äôt get them into the hands of readers because our books are lost in a sea of other titles. A reader stumbling upon any particular book is equivalent to the proverbial needle in a haystack.It‚Äôs true everyone has a story to tell, but it‚Äôs equally true that not everyone is capable of telling that story. And with the market already saturated with books, is it really that egregious of me to demand quality over quantity?We all know there‚Äôs a stigma associated with self-published books. And every time readers of traditionally published books boldly venture into the indie market, only to find themselves reading a book full of grammatical errors and spelling issues‚Äîor just an awful story‚Äîthat stigma is reinforced in their minds. When this happens, indie authors everywhere lose credibility and sales because those disappointed readers oftentimes make a resolution right then and there to never again waste their money‚Äîor their time‚Äîreading another self-published book. (I confess: I‚Äôve even reached that point of frustration myself, which is why I rarely read indie books anymore.)We‚Äôre all in this together. What one indie author does in the publishing world‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîripples throughout the entire indie publishing community. A poorly written and edited book not only hurts your own sales, but it negatively effects sales for the rest of us.It‚Äôs because of this ripple effect that I plead with my fellow indie authors to stop chasing after the glory of how many books you put out (and how fast you can put them out), and start focusing on the quality of those books. Your readers deserve better than that and the collective body of indie authors who take their craft seriously deserve better than that.Work hard, write well, and publish responsibly.Sincerely,‚Äî J.L.

Friends with Babies and Friends without Babies; an Unspoken Battle?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/friends-with-babies-and-friends-without-babies-an-unspoken-battle-630b0ab52a61,Claudia Vidor,344,6,1169,"I feel that this article will make me quite unpopular, but as no one is talking about it, I feel it‚Äôs time to share some light on the topic.When I was pregnant, I enjoyed weekends and dinner outs with the same friends I had been hanging out with for many, many moons. We were talking about life, our desires, job issues, relationship, and so forth. I wasn‚Äôt interested to discuss my pregnancy (what‚Äôs to discuss anyhow), and I kept all the nursery ideas, and the latest scan results for myself.I thought no one cared, and I wanted to please people and appeared to be interesting.I hated the idea that my friends would judge me as being ‚Äúone of those pregnant women‚Äù.In hindsight, I was just acting, and that is why nowadays I treat honesty as a top priority.I thought my friends would remain the same after birthing my baby, and I was hoping they all would come to my house, taking the turn to hold my little ray of sunshine. I was not prepared for the lack of interest I received from all my non-babies friends.Slowly, slowly, after the first couple of weeks where I felt showered with gifts, love, and their presence, they all disappeared. New people, especially new mothers, became part of my daily routine, and for some reason, I kept saying yes to night outs with my old group of friends, although the only thing I wanted, was staying home with my baby.I felt as if I was meant to keep up my social life, and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about my baby when meeting with them because‚Ä¶boring, right?Let‚Äôs say it out loud once again: I felt I couldn‚Äôt talk about the newly found love of my life because they would deem the conversation boring.Yet, I spent hours listening to breakups, visa problems, career changes. Was I interested? Most of the time I was bored to death and I just wanted an excuse to fly back home, but for some reason I never said anything.I lived through awkward moments where I wanted to share everything about the first step of my little one (and I thought I couldn‚Äôt), and times when I witnessed the only non-mother on the dinner table enduring a never-ending conversation about nappy changes and sleepless nights. It was unfair on both sides.At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I tried to be great friends and to make the conversations fair from everyone, I started receiving less invites from my non-mother friends, which would always underline how much I talked about my baby (5 minutes if ever), although it was so acceptable for them to monopolise the attention and discuss their relationship -in minutia- for the twelfth time.I suffered, I felt inadequate, not interesting enough, and as if I didn‚Äôt belong.What did I learn from it?People-pleasing never workI have been a people pleaser for all my life, and it did serve me little; it caused me to spread myself too thin while seeking external reinforcement for how smart, beautiful, clever, interesting I was. Then one day I found out that it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, 1 out of the 5 people you meet won‚Äôt like you. At all.So why go the extra mile to be accepted by someone who will never be a friend anyway? Why going the extra mile and participate in dinners when the only thing you want to do is sleep? Why trying to be someone I‚Äôm not?It‚Äôs not about mothers and non-mothers, it‚Äôs about friendshipsIn the beginning, I thought there was an unspoken battle between mothers and non-mothers. I later realised it‚Äôs all about friendship. Your true friends will love your baby as their own, or they will at least ask about him, and cuddle him as soon as they see him. They don‚Äôt need to go the extra mile, babysit, do a cartwheel or bring presents every time they come out for dinner, but they will be present for you to talk about your fears, desires, doubts, sometimes baby-related, sometimes not. And they won‚Äôt mind catching up at a park, because it‚Äôs so much easier for you.Friendships are like love relationships and are made of a lovely dance of taking and giving, and the topic of conversation shouldn‚Äôt matter, as long as the relationship is nurtured.I‚Äôm interestingWhen the invitations to go out were few and far in between, I started questioning myself if I was interesting enough. I also found myself whinging to my husband ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to talk about with people‚Äù, as I started believing I didn‚Äôt have much to give; he looked at me in disbelief ‚ÄúAmore, you find EVERYTHING interesting, and you always have an opinion, what the hell are you talking about‚ÄùI was doubting myself, my being, and for what? I was focusing on the people that weren‚Äôt texting me any longer, instead of focusing my time on the ones that were calling me every day. When I realised what I was doing, my perception and reality shifted, and I started enjoying motherhood and my new friends so much more, as the fear of missing out was gone for good.I wasn‚Äôt missing out at all, I was leaving the best version of my life!Some people don‚Äôt want to hear it, and it‚Äôs okSome people are jealous, and some people are simply not interested in babies, and they are interested in you, but not if you talk about babies. I find it fair, as we are all different, and it‚Äôs important to have an honest conversation on the topic so that we can all decide if the friendship has an expiry date.If you don‚Äôt want children, and you are clear about it, why do you have to deal with my baby shower and all the baby birthdays and so on? I find that some friends can survive outside the motherhood space. We all have that friend that doesn‚Äôt want kids, is a good communicator and lots of fun; with that friend, I make a point to meet in neutral territory and speak about everything but babies (without being afraid to mention them of course). As long as we have a clear understanding of where we stand, and we are happy with the conditions of this kind of friendship, why not giving it a go?It can be so helpful to spend a night out without discussing naps scheduling and toddler foods.Bottom line, I find that real friendship can survive babies, as much as it can survive career, relationship, and country changes. It is important for a mother to go out the ‚Äúbaby bubble‚Äù and understand that not everyone finds those cutesy pictures of naked bums particularly interesting; at the same time it is important for a non-mother to understand that asking about the baby, even for a split second, and listen to the answer with open ears, is of the uttermost importance. There is no battle out there, it‚Äôs a simple adjustment to a new season of life.",19/07/2019,0,0,4,4,1050,699,3,0,0,0,86

Moving Up The Value Chain in Machine Learning,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/moving-up-the-value-chain-in-machine-learning-c2dc7e0e893f,Kevin Ann,560,8,1769,"In my daily work in Machine Learning and Full-Stack Software Engineering, I touch many aspects of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and am constantly surprised by how many new services are becoming available in the Machine Learning space, as well as their integration with other more bread-and-butter services involving computation and storage across the sprawling AWS platform. Furthermore, price-performance is improving exponentially.This post will articulate my thoughts on moving up the value chain in Machine Learning, and how this means that an individual or small team can leverage their talent, knowledge, and limited time to do much more than before and the implications for architecting systems to maximize productivity. It will start from the lower levels and move towards increasingly higher levels in the value chain.Except in special cases, there‚Äôs no reason why an individual or organization would need to buy, setup, and maintain individual servers for computing tasks such as processing or storage since it can all be abstracted away through virtual machines and various services. Not only is it vastly cheaper and less labor intensive to spin up a virtual machine, but it permits scaling infinitely (limited by capital) with various value-added services such as automated backups, enhanced security, etc.Indeed, infrastructure-as-a-service or datacenter-as-a-service is where it all begins. This has been the case for over a decade, and it‚Äôs become so commonplace, cheap, and efficient that not much attention is paid here. I believe this effect will move rapidly up the value chain.AWS even provides disk images that can be used to spin up virtual machines in the state of that image with pre-installed software packages to save on even the simple act of installing free open source software and all the dependencies. To get a machine to a usable operating state already abstracts away many entire job functions and permits starting fairly advanced up the value chain compared to even a few years ago where a programmer would need to configure Linux, install Python, install packages, and get all the versioning and dependencies correct. A nightmare indeed that‚Äôs abstracted away with such software as Anaconda or Pip.Databases hosted on servers must be setup and maintained, adding a layer of manual labor. This can be abstracted away via various serves. I focus on canonical SQL and No-SQL solutions.Amazon has RedShift, among other SQL solutions, which could be coarsely viewed as an infinitely scalable relational database. Queries are blazingly fast and you can search on tens of millions of rows in seconds. Amazon has DynamoDB, among other NoSQL solutions, with functionality as you can expect with non-relational databases.It takes seconds to configure these and have it up and running. The hardest and most time-consuming part is simply to get oriented and get permissions correct. It frees the programmer up to focus on thinking about the process of adding, organizing, or thinking through the data.After having technical infrastructure in place for computing and storage of data, the true task of machine learning begins. About 80%-90% of the effort is simply to clean and prep the data to be well-structured for use in the machine learning process. I suppose that this part of the value chain may be very difficult to abstract away and requires actual human effort.There exist many ways to mitigate the cleanup and structuring process, such as having very clear business requirements involving very precise rules to gather, validate, and structure the data much upstream.In Machine Learning, there‚Äôs various techniques to hold out a training set, a validation set, then a test set. These are then compared with various assessment metrics such as a confusion matrix to calculate precision, recall, accuracy, F2-score, etc. to determine how good the model is and in which way.Ideally, these commodity machine learning process could be abstracted away to just view it as:1. Training2. Testing3. Predicting (In Reinforcement Learning, this would be modified to be some scalar to maximize, instead of some metric such as accuracy.)Amazon SageMaker allows for these processes to be abstracted away so you can just focus on the overall problem.If the training, testing, or prediction doesn‚Äôt proceed according to expectations and various statistical metrics are not met, then it‚Äôs repeated in successive iterations. This may involve tuning the parameters in specific machine learning models such as support vector machines or perhaps starting weights in neural networks. It may also involve hyperparameters such as regularization parameter, learning rate for neural networks, and so on.Before, these needed to be done ‚Äúby hand‚Äù as the engineer had to write loops to go through the state space of parameters, defining minimum, maximum, and increments. Now SageMaker has processes to do this automatically, saving time here, thus freeing the developer. Very important since this is not a very creative or deep process, but rather a shallow superficial mind-numbing process, something that should be abstracted away if possible.In all these cases, training a model and optimizing it via tuning through a range of parameters and hyperparameters may improve prediction accuracy, but it faces the fundamental limit of insufficient data.In fact, a superior tuning and classifier training process with less data is often worse than an inferior tuning and classifier training process with ‚Äúmore‚Äù data. Basically, more data can pick up the slack where a model or process falls short. This is the true advantage. More data is better data.This is even more a competitive advantage in a niche field relative to the sophistication of your machine learning process and computational resources.This is where individuals or companies can differentiate themselves and have the true competitive advantage. The AI startup Blue River Technology was acquired by agricultural machinery company John Deere via mounting cameras on tractors to identify plants and weeds.Basically, using Deep Learning, Blue River became the world‚Äôs expert in identifying if something caught on camera is a plant or weed. It‚Äôs sprayed with fertilizer if it‚Äôs a plant and sprayed with a pesticide if it‚Äôs a weed. By enhancing the ability to identify these plants in a specific context, they were able to reduce the volume of chemicals sprayed by up to 90% to minimize the chemical footprint in our food chain. The key advantage here was here was having data in the form of screenshots to do deep learning on the plants and weeds, and having more of that data than anyone in the world. It was able to outperform Google, Amazon, or other large tech companies which easily has orders of magnitude more computational power and much more manpower.If you don‚Äôt have the data and/or the computational resources for training, it can be possible to abstract away the training process by jumping all the way to the end to get a trained model instead. Indeed ImageNet with 14 million images and 20,000 different categories is the underlying data set for various convolutional neural network models in the form of weight parameters in the nodes. These are available as free open source files that you can import and start classifying. By having access to the neural network weights in convolutional network trained models , you bypass the need to access this original data, the massive computational resources required, as well as the human software development and infrastructure required.You are moving up the value chain simply by having access to trained classifiers. This is actually useful even if you have access to all the original components to train such as the original data set, the open source algorithms, since it bypasses that labor and computation, which could be viewed as fungible and interconvertible with money.As for algorithms, it‚Äôs interesting to note that simply being able to import packages that encode algorithms that were developed by an intense research effort is already moving far up the value chain by simply using thousands of hours of work by brilliant minds, and furthermore, even this can be abstracted away yet further by bypassing the creation of these models by the Machine Learning algorithms.Interestingly, Amazon Marketplace actually sells trained classifiers. For example, one suite of classifiers from Perception Health can be rented to predict risk of various diseases such as Breast Cancer, heart Failure, Fibromyalgia, Colorectal Cancer, and a few dozen others. As data to be run through the classifiers, it is timestamps, procedure ICD-10, procedure HCPCS codes, and diagnosis, and a few other data points accessible from patient histories. These models were trained models on billions of medical claims which would effectively be impossible for a machine learning developer to get access to. Even if they did, it might not be useful to run through the entire process.So it appears that we can rapidly move up the value chain by abstracting away the collection of data, the data itself, the training of classifiers by tuning parameters and meta-parameters, the classifiers themselves, as well as all the code and attention required to step through these processes.When confronting problems that involve Machine Learning problems, it‚Äôs important to think and strategize how far up the value chain using existing tools and services before you even begin in solving the problem in the problem domain, rather than starting from the bottom and working your way up and taking pride in a job well done in the technical/coding domain. When you wield powerful technical tools, it‚Äôs easy to view problems and try to use those tools, rather than think of how you can bypass even the very use of the tools.This is important since even if you are able to maximize at various parts of the lower levels of the value chain, since it does not necessarily imply beneficial progress on the higher parts of the value chain, which ultimately constitute the most potential to minimize development time and attendant capital costs, and to maximize value to increase revenue and profit.For example, assuming you have the most elegant and efficient code to loop through and train convolutional neural networks on ImageNet and assess the various parts of the training process to maximize success metrics, it‚Äôs not guaranteed that you can come up with better trained models than those that currently exist and freely available to import and use.The true advantage of taking this approach of moving up the value chain is that you can iterate quickly and move to solving the actual problem in the problem domain, rather than intermediate, inconsequential, artificial, and/or technical problems in the infrastructure, machine learning, and coding and software engineering domain. There‚Äôs no sense in re-inventing the wheel. Try to always seek leverage to accomplish the most via thinking, while trying to minimize the actual ‚Äúdoing.‚Äù This is especially since we all have such limited time and energy, and there‚Äôs so many problems in the world to solve.",18/07/2019,0,0,1,0,1050,700,1,0,0,3,30
"Hey Singapore, the future is in our own backyard.",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/hey-singapore-the-future-is-in-our-own-backyard-1f2ba04fce34,Tian Wen,32,5,991,"Growing up, I was a kid in love with ideas and stories. Having kiddos perpetually glued to a screen wasn‚Äôt in fashion then, and every Sunday at Grandma‚Äôs I would take a hula hoop, pretend it was a magic school-bus, and take my younger cousins on field trips to make-believe realms filled with all sorts of oddities. In primary school, I created a fantasy role-playing game and got my classmates to become knights and mages for a year using nothing more than a 2B pencil, a jotter book and my vivid imagination. Every single occupation I aspired towards ‚Äî archaeologist, historian, diplomat, writer ‚Äî was about, in some sense, telling great stories.Singapore has told the world a great story, and as much as I detest the heat and the crowds at home, I am still very much addicted to this read. But as young Singaporeans like myself continue the narrative, I wonder if all the trappings of a great story have left us blindsided to the reality of what‚Äôs going on, just next door.From lack of democratic practices and press freedom to a politically sterile society of automatons, we are no strangers to critique, both justified or otherwise. But an article that was recently published by Rice Media really struck a chord with me. Beyond the stereotypes of cheap food and same-old tourist hotspots, Southeast Asia doesn‚Äôt quite excite the average Singaporean. Yet, this a region that is:When 8 out of 18 of the world‚Äôs best performing economies are found in the region and the impression most Singaporeans have are ‚Äúdilapidated‚Äù and ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, we‚Äôre clearly dealing with a serious disconnect here. Why Singaporeans seem to have such a ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù perception of a region that is ironically not ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù has been debated to death, and changing perceptions is obviously going to take more than just a lengthy argumentative essay.‚Äú a society which holds meritocracy as its sole yardstick nonetheless has failed to show innovation and entrepreneurial zeal.‚ÄùPerhaps that ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù perception really stems from an entrenched aversion to risk. At home, we enjoy political and economic stability, and everyone simply aspires to a comfortable, material living standard. As a recent article by Tech In Asia points out, only 27% of the students surveyed said yes when asked if they were willing to join a tech startup. This is in blatant contrast to the trend in Vietnam, where nearly 75% of university graduates are interested in starting their own business.A colleague of mine had a friend who did her Bachelor‚Äôs at NUS, and when asked what she thought of her fellow Singaporean classmates, she said ‚Äúarrogant and all-assuming‚ÄùI had the privilege of participating in the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) Summer School at Fulbright University Vietnam in 2017, and it was then and there that I got to meet many talented youths driven to better their lives and those of others by pursuing their own businesses or furthering social causes. Some of these awesome folks just turned 18 when I met them, and one of them was even running two side businesses and a couple of social initiatives ‚Äî all while working as a manager for a state enterprise!Youths are putting out all sorts of ideas across Southeast Asia, and the projects I‚Äôve seen so far are a fair mix of labour-intensive, employment-driven social enterprises and high tech, lean startups. While the region is not quite as sophisticated as the likes of Silicon Valley, Stockholm or Shanghai, e27 has pointed out that key sectors with the most number of deals in the region in 2018 include financial technology (Fintech), e-commerce, education technology and healthcare technology. With innovative startups like TrustingSocial (Vietnam) and Haruka Edu (Indonesia), and regional unicorns like Go-Jek (Indonesia) , Grab (Singapore) and VNG (Vietnam), youths in Southeast Asia already have a thriving ecosystem (and models) to turn to.As a rejoinder to my earlier claim, Southeast Asia may lack the sophistication of more mature startup ecosystems, but it possesses a different sort of strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities ‚Äî opportunities that Singapore, and Singaporeans, should be well-poised to exploit.Returning to Vietnam 2 years later as part of the pioneer batch of the National University of Singapore Overseas Colleges Program (Southeast Asia) in Ho Chi Minh City, I‚Äôve witnessed how an energized population can rapidly transform the face of the city they live in. The tallest building in Ho Chi Minh City is now the glitzy Landmark 81, and the sheer number of luxury high-rise construction projects across the city are a testament to Vietnam‚Äôs growth prospects. Street food vendors have visibly dwindled, but entrepreneurship continues to thrive in the number of youth-initiated startups or social projects in the country. It‚Äôs a popular notion that Singaporeans are very ‚ÄúKiasu‚Äù, but wait till you‚Äôve seen how the Vietnamese do. Everyone here is in a perpetual rush, and there‚Äôs an unspeakable energy that‚Äôs propelling this country forward withbreakneck speed.Southeast Asia may lack the sophistication of more mature startup ecosystems, but it possesses a different sort of strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities ‚Äî opportunities that Singapore, and Singaporeans, should be well-poised to exploit.Everyone has ideas, and everyone loves stories. Before the Wii arrived at Grandma‚Äôs, we‚Äôd always pester our parents for just a wee bit more time so that we can finish our traveling fantasies. Every boy in class became a fan of my RPG, and before long I started to spice things up with ripoffs from Warcraft and Digimon. But both activities faded away with time, and I got lost chasing parochial visions along the way.Singaporean youths need to snap out of these parochial visions, and we need to rethink our perceptions of the region around us. Southeast Asia is our future, and we need to look towards understanding it better, or risk losing the plot.This article was first published on my personal blog at awayintent.me.

Both these states of joy and sorrow linked to sensory experiences are temporary. Life becomes uncertain and unpredictable when trapped in a cyclical movement between happiness and unhappiness.Life becomes uncertain and unpredictable when trapped in a cyclical movement between happiness and unhappiness.The most significant source of stress for people is the future. Those who are happy and comfortable in the present worry it might end, while those who are struggling in the present fear the future getting worse. In both situations, the struggle is for lasting happiness.The most significant source of stress for people is the future.We lose precious time in the search for a joyful state that does not leave us. Human ingenuity that can create external comfort and convenience cannot help with inner freedom and joy. We can send human-made objects to Mars, but we have not come up with external solutions for this internal struggle for happiness.We lose precious time in the search for a joyful state that does not leave us.Existence has equipped everyone equally to mine the interiority for lasting happiness.How do we do it?The extent and timing of life‚Äôs upturns and downturns differ from one individual to another. That is a fact of life. Our resistance to the acceptance of this fact leads to comparison with others. When we compare ourselves with those whose lives we perceive as being on the upswing, which is a defacto correlate of happiness in the worldly sense, we experience unhappiness.There are many external variables out of our direct control, influencing success and failure, and hence, joy and sorrow. The sensory apparatus bringing in desirable and undesirable experiences are agnostic to the type of experience. Once it passes through the doors of the mind, we begin to sort through this information, labeling it according to our desires and aspirations.We can divide sensory information streaming into the mind into two categories.1. General interest2. Personal contextThis differentiation is essential in the context of what the mind does with incoming sensory data. Information of a general nature such as the happenings in the world keeps the mind occupied for a limited time. It is like reading a newspaper. Just as we don‚Äôt go back to yesterday‚Äôs news, we forget information of general nature that the mind consumes daily.The subconscious mind stores all sensory information coming into the mind, including those bits to which we pay little attention. From there, fragments of information well up as passing thoughts and dreams. Such transitory thoughts are like the paint on a wall. The color of paint offers no structural support but adds a finished look.Information of a personal context gets special treatment. It has to pass through the gates of our likes and dislikes. There is a ‚Äòwalled off personal area‚Äô in the mind. We can compare our likes and dislikes to bricks and cement which bind together to create a wall. Although likes and dislikes differ widely, they cannot be separated. Every like has a corresponding dislike. Unless we dislike something, we cannot preferentially like another thing. They work in concert to build the edifice of the mind.Taken together, the ‚Äòbrick and cement‚Äô of likes and dislikes, and the finishing‚Äô paint‚Äô of general information that the subconscious stores, completes the picture of the mind.The mental picture we have of life is a play between the mind and awareness. Although the mind is a place of movement of thoughts, as a whole, it is static. It cannot move from place to place. A solid wall is stationary, but its constituent atoms are in continual movement, similar to the concept of the static nature of the mind as a whole and the dynamic environment of individual thoughts.The mental picture we have of life is a play between the mind and awareness.Our awareness is in a continual movement just as air moves in space. We cannot see the flow of air in space, but we can feel it‚Äôs presence. Just as we cannot confine air within the walls of a building, we cannot confine awareness solely to the mind.Awareness does not originate in the mind. We can delink it from the mind by taking advantage of its movement in and out of the mind. The less we choose between what we like and dislike, the more the distance between mind and awareness.The less we choose between what we like and dislike, the more the distance between mind and awareness.Experience of life through the mind and awareness are entirely different. Through the mind, living in the present is relative to the past, and through awareness, it becomes absolute. Awareness does not have a past. It is a present phenomenon.Through the mind, living in the present is relative to the past, and through awareness, it becomes absolute.We can compare different walls of a house, their size, the color of paint, thickness, and whether they are structurally essential or not. Similarly, the mind sees life through the lens of comparison. Comparisons exist both externally and internally. We compare one thought with another, one emotion with another, our lives versus that of others, etc.We cannot see air, but we can measure its quality in different parts of the world based on particulate densities of pollutants. Similarly, awareness has varying degrees of contamination based on our involvement in the mind and thoughts. Just as air is very pure in remote and unpopulated places, awareness gets purer as we get further away from densely packed thoughts.Just as humans depend on air, but the air, in turn, does not need human activity to exist, the mind depends on awareness for its existence. Whereas awareness can standalone without the mind‚Äôs involvement. When awareness is entangled with the mind, we are continually searching for happiness. This search happens through picking and choosing, retaining and discarding, comparing and contrasting between various experiences.When awareness is entangled with the mind, we are continually searching for happiness.To render awareness independent of the mind, entering a witnessing state is essential. Witnessing leads to pure and choiceless awareness and growing awareness, in turn, strengthens our witnessing ability. Witnessing offers an independent unbiased viewpoint, while the mind‚Äôs viewpoint is always partisan to one thought or another.To render awareness independent of the mind, entering a witnessing state is essential.It is through awareness that we touch the eternal spring of happiness that is within all. The mind searches outside for pleasure, while awareness and witnessing turn us inward. When we own a car, we have full access to it all the time. Similarly, once we are in an awareness that is independent of the mind, it comes with a perk ‚Äî growing inner happiness that does not depend on the world.When we are in an awareness that is independent of the mind, there is growing inner happiness that does not depend on the world.Awareness ensures that the keys to happiness remain with us and not with objects and experiences of the world. Once we have this key, we never lose it, just as fingers always remain attached to our body. Happiness follows us wherever we go, and we need not be in search of joy. We can utilize our time in giving to the world rather than trying to wring happiness from the world. When we are in awareness, happiness becomes a permanent appendage. No thought can provide us with such assurance.Originally published at https://mindandsoul.space on July 18, 2019.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,3,1050,700,1,0,0,3,87
"Turning A Dream Into Reality, Step-By-Step",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/dreams-can-come-true-if-you-work-on-them-methodically-1ba8831e4474,Omar Rabbolini,641,9,1430,"Kyle had a dream. He wanted to become a great engineer, not much for personal glory or vanity, but to be able to relocate to the United States and work for one of the big tech companies out there.The dream was very clear in his mind. It had been his major preoccupation throughout his student years here in Hong Kong, and something he would often talk about once you gained his trust. There was only one problem: he had no idea on how to go about realizing it.I got to know Kyle at his university‚Äôs career fair, as he was looking for an internship for the summer before his final year. Our paths crossed several times since then, through different events and a few interviews. The year following his graduation, he managed to join my team.I knew from the get-go he would not be around for too long. He had his dream to follow, and I was OK with that. Could he turn that dream into reality ? I was willing to help. He needed a plan.There are a couple of axioms we need to consider before discussing the plan Kyle adopted:Therefore, to realize our dream, we need a method that gives us a way to both direct our effort, and to maintain our motivation to carry on until the dream is achieved.Kyle employed one such method, specifically a variation of a tool used by big tech to drive employees‚Äô growth, customized with a spin to better suit the personal nature of his own goal.The tool we are talking about is the OKR.What is an OKR and how does it relate to my dream?OKR stands for Objective and Key Results:You can use the Key Results as intermediate milestones in a plan towards reaching the Objective, or as a bunch of concurrent activities geared towards the same final result. My preference tends toward the former, as it creates a clearer action plan.Translating the dream into an Objective, or a set of Objectives, is the beginning of the materialization of that dream, bringing it down from the world of ideas within our mind to that of reality.This translation is akin to a high-level breakdown activity, rationalizing the dream into concrete steps that can make it happen.In Kyle‚Äôs case, a potential breakdown for ‚Äúbecoming a great engineer‚Äù could look like this:Note how the second objective is subject to the successful completion of the first, while ‚Äúcross-team collaboration‚Äù can happen in parallel, independently from the other two. This is OK, as long as the amount of parallel activity is minimal. Remember that our purpose for setting these Objectives is to create directed effort, and the more objectives there are, the more diluted is the focus on each.Once the Objectives are defined, we can start looking at their Key Results. As we mentioned earlier, these are the main activities which, once achieved, would allow us to complete the Objective.Let‚Äôs look at Objective 1 from the example above to see how it can be achieved through Key Results:Each Key Result should be easily measurable, possibly with a percentage score, and should have a due date. Also, the score should have a ‚Äúpass mark‚Äù: a threshold to tell us whether the Key Result has been completed, and to which extent (the higher the better, although a ‚Äúpass‚Äù is enough in taking us towards our dream).Some sources suggest setting the pass mark to about 60 / 70%. This allows us, upon completion, to identify goals which were too ‚Äúsimple‚Äù or unambitious as the score for these would tend towards 90 / 100%. When dealing with personal goals, this technique is not strictly necessary, but it is worth mentioning for completeness.Failure to finish a Key Result by its due date will impact the completion of the Objective in a timely manner, delaying the overall realization of our plan. Of course, this is easy to understand from a rational perspective, but is it enough to foster enough motivation to keep us on track?Due dates alone are not going to get us out of bed and do the work. In fact, they begin to mean very little the further they are in the future, or when the associated tasks are so big that a successful strategy for tackling them is not obvious.At this stage, the Key Results are severely weakened to the point of becoming less ‚Äúreal‚Äù in our minds.When Key Results are no longer ‚Äúreal‚Äù, we are more likely to lose the motivation to stick to the plan, since change is uncomfortable as we saw earlier, and the connection between the effort that we are making and the Key Result we are trying to achieve is no longer apparent. So how do we keep them ‚Äúreal‚Äù?The best way to deal with this problem is to break down the Key Results even further and to create to-do lists with more imminent due dates. Studies* have shown that to-do lists allow the brain to focus on outstanding tasks, making them more likely to be completed in a timely manner and keeping the Key Results alive.* See ‚ÄúReferences‚Äù section at the end of this story for more detailsTo avoid excessive pre-planning, which itself is a form of procrastination, we can create these to-do lists weekly by looking at what we achieved in the previous week, and what we can do this week to get closer to completing the Key Result in question.This works best when the Key Results have a projected duration of a few weeks. Therefore, a good guideline would be to have monthly Key Results associated to quarterly Objectives.An example weekly to-do list for Kyle‚Äôs Key Result 1.1 would look like this:‚ÄúSometimes, things do not go according to plan.‚Äù‚Äî A sentence nominated for the ‚ÄúUnderstatement Of The Century‚Äù awardLife is unpredictable. An unexpected event or unforeseen family circumstances can easily throw out even the best of OKR-based plans. Additionally, blind spots in the plan itself, maybe coming from an incomplete knowledge of the goals we initially set, might rear their heads halfway through the process.To be able to achieve our dream in spite of these issues, it is important to regularly review the plan and adjust any outstanding OKR as needed. We can either tie this review to the completion of a Key Result, or set a recurring event, for instance for the first Wednesday of the month, to have a guaranteed touch point regardless of potential delays.In any case, we should aim at developing a positive relationship with the plan. As part of the review, we can think about how the plan makes us feel and use this as an indication of whether it is too lax or too aggressive, and make the necessary adjustments.Ultimately, we want to ensure the plan is balanced: realistic, but at the same time not too comfortable. There should always be a certain level of challenge to push us to complete the Key Results, while ensuring they are achievable.To sum up, we can say that:Kyle understood this and worked very hard to turn his dream into an actionable plan. On my side, I functioned more as a sounding board to bounce off ideas when he was stuck on defining his Key Results. He was also very good at creating and completing his weekly to-do lists independently, sometimes moving unfinished tasks to the next week, sometimes throwing away stale tasks that were not contributing much to the achievement of the Key Results.Eventually, Kyle got the promotions he deserved, and carried out his relocation plan within five years.To this day, I wish he had not left my team, but I know he is where he always wanted to be, living the life he dreamed of, and I am happy to have been a part of that realization process.Thanks for sticking around till the end of this story. I hope you enjoyed it, and found some useful insights.To further your knowledge on OKRs, especially on their wider application for teams, here is some great reading material:Disclaimer: I use affiliate links to Amazon for book recommendations.

The Introvert‚Äôs Guide To Surviving Conferences & Industry Events,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-introverts-guide-to-industry-events-conferences-1eab9fad297c,Jennifer Aldrich,11800,4,662,"I am a friendly person. I smile on a regular basis, chat with folks at the water cooler, and discuss the weather with people in elevators. Small get-togethers with close friends are my jam.But drop me in a social gathering of more than about 5 other people and I‚Äôll start acting like a social leper, wishing I had the option to walk across hot coals while stabbing my eyes out with sticks rather than suffering through trying to socialize with the room full of strangers.At design industry meet-ups, my solution used to be to grab a vodkatini and quickly drink it while I hid in the corner. I figured once I‚Äôd gotten one drink down, I could check off ‚Äúsocialize with others while at the event‚Äù from my list and exit the scene.As a designer, this was problematic because I love networking with other designers and hearing about what they‚Äôre working on.But a couple of years ago, I attended a conference panel session that changed everything for me from an event networking standpoint. I‚Äôd like to share the quick tips I learned that have worked especially well for me ever since ‚Äî and not one involves a vodka.The panelist recommended that you look around the room, find someone who looks as uncomfortable as you feel, and go talk to them.A session attendee raised his hand and asked, ‚ÄúBut what if the person doesn‚Äôt want to talk, and they think I‚Äôm a weirdo for approaching them?‚ÄùThe panelist‚Äôs answer:‚ÄúThink about it this way. One of 4 things will likely happen:In the event that number 4 happens, who cares? You don‚Äôt know this person. You‚Äôll likely never have to speak to them ever again. You have nothing to lose.‚ÄùI‚Äôve employed this advice at every single networking event I‚Äôve attended since, and it‚Äôs always worked like a charm. I‚Äôve even had several people thank me for rescuing them!Post an update on LinkedIn and Twitter asking if anyone is at the event, and if so ask if they would like to link up for coffee/food/a between-session high-five. People are very receptive to this approach.Meet in a public place, obviously, just in case the person is a designer by day/serial killer by night.I did this at the last 2 conferences I attended and got a great response. I met several designers who I‚Äôve stayed in touch with.Take a break when you need one. There‚Äôs no reason you need to spend every single waking second networking when you attend a conference. It‚Äôs okay to skip a session and go crash in your hotel room to recharge your social interaction battery every once in a while.It took me years to take the plunge and present at a conference.Why did I finally go for it? A friend told me it wasn‚Äôt fair to the community to keep all of my experiences to myself, when I could potentially make a positive impact on the work of others. That shove (or guilt trip, however you‚Äôd like to look at it) was the catalyst that got me to come out from behind my laptop.I still get really nervous and need to crash for about an hour after I present. In fact, after one particularly long session, I grabbed my lunch and legit went and hid in my car to blast some music and decompress.Even though I feel pretty drained after presenting, I‚Äôve started to enjoy speaking at events. Having people come up after the session to say that they can‚Äôt wait to employ the research method I presented, or to tell me that they believe the internal process flows I described will improve their inter-departmental relationships too, makes it all worthwhile.What I‚Äôm trying to say is this: When it comes to events, don‚Äôt count yourself out just because you‚Äôre an introvert.The things you know could really help other people in the industry.This is me giving you the same shove/guilt trip my friend gave me.

What Software Design Patterns Can Teach Organisations About Effective Communication,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/what-software-design-patterns-can-teach-organisations-about-effective-communication-91cf7d373bfd,Nida,427,5,1172,"1 in every 3 projects fail due to poor communication. Given this centrality, it is natural to assume a heightened focus on communication skills and strategies by businesses. However, according to a recent survey conducted by the Project Management Institution, only 51 percent of business leaders ‚Äî a figure that just manages to scrape a majority ‚Äî agree that soft skills such as communication are much more vital today.In sharp contrast, significant emphasis is placed on communication within the software space. Firms heavily invest in their technology departments, and rightly so. Dedicated teams of designers and architects are assembled to design liquid applications that enable information to flow seamlessly throughout the digital ecosystem.A key resource often used to do so is software design patterns.Software design patterns offer reusable solutions to recurring problems encountered during software development. By codifying best practices for communication between components ‚Äî bits of code successfully ‚Äòtalking‚Äô to other bits of code ‚Äî they equip programmers with a shared vocabulary to facilitate development. Extrapolating these patterns to an organisational scale offers firms a useful framework to re-configure communication strategies ‚Äî a much-needed practice in today‚Äôs volatile techno-cultural landscape.Patterns can be thought of as blueprints for effective communication between code. By assigning roles for bits of code to follow, they ensure a fluid flow of data, protect against losses of information and enable a vast network of nodes to successfully interact.The original intent behind these patterns was to stipulate how code should optimally behave in various problem scenarios. The authors of the seminal book, ‚ÄòDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software‚Äô preface the book by acknowledging the inherent value of patterns and how they had ‚Äòproven themselves in many different contexts.‚ÄôWhilst the allusion to multiple contexts here refers to the software engineering domain itself, we can go one step further by extending the stipulated domain. This way, core principles underpinning these patterns can be adopted and emulated by organisations.To demonstrate this, I have identified three suitable patterns of communication within the software design domain, discerned the underlying principles behind these object-orientated patterns, and applied them to people-orientated interaction between technology consultancies, businesses, and customers.In a similar fashion to the book, for each selected pattern, I have described the intent (the core principle), and the applicability (the implementation) to a problem scenario.Continually monitor changes in behaviours, triggering appropriate actions based on these changes in stateBusinesses that are primarily reliant on legacy systems are often denigrated as ‚Äòliving in the past‚Äô by firms who perceive themselves as digital disruptors living in the modern age.Anthropologists have termed this phenomenon ‚Äòdenial of coevalness‚Äô, whereby people tend to perceive others from the same era as living in a different, often medieval age. This has been shown to result in a qualitative loss within anthropological studies. Similarly, when consultancies engage with businesses, this rhetoric proves divisive and alienating, resulting in poor-quality projects.What is needed is a deep understanding of why certain businesses have been reluctant to rotate to the New. A form of observation that situates fears and concerns within the wider context of the organisation‚Äôs culture ‚Äî what I call organisational culture relativism ‚Äî is imperative.In doing so, firms should be mindful of avoiding bias and preconceptions. One way to achieve this is to adopt a ‚Äòtabula rasa‚Äô approach. The idea is to start with a blank canvas, embrace empathy and gradually garner insights to paint a human-centric picture of client needs.Harnessing the power of observation will allow consultancies to offer insightful, tailored solutions to address deep-rooted problems that are not necessarily immediately obvious.Act as a conduit between incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work togetherInsights informed by analytics are now widely recognised as precursors to successful organisational change. However, a Forbes survey of 400 business executives revealed only a meagre 13% are fully leveraging the power of data analytics.This is rapidly changing. Remaining businesses are naturally eager to follow suit, seeking the disruption afforded by tailored data-driven insights.As hyper-personalisation becomes the norm, consultancies will need to acknowledge and respond to the paradigm shift. By striking the right balance between companies who value data and customers who value privacy, they can act as conduits mediating the relationship.The key here is to analyse data, not within a technical framework but a social one. This will uncover an interplay between companies and customers ‚Äî one that is unequal.One way to remedy this imbalance has been exemplified in the legal sphere. The recent GDPR legislation extends data protection rights afforded to individuals, offering increased autonomy.Similarly, firms will need to empower customers by embracing a combination of ‚Äòtrust and transparency‚Äô. To be truly successful conduits, consultancies must adopt multi-faceted transparency, elucidating specifically which data is being collected and why; how the underlying infrastructure is secured, and how this can benefit both companies and customers.A recent report by the European Economic Social Committee echoes this sentiment, advocating for firms to ‚Äòadopt transparent procedures and ensure that these procedures are easily accessible and knowable by the public.‚ÄôOnly then can the perception of data-driven insights shift from encroaching to emancipatory.Treat collections of heterogeneous individuals as a cohesive wholeConway‚Äôs law posits an isomorphic relationship between team structures and software design.It is a common trope used to justify the creation of small teams. As smaller teams have a lesser need for cross-team communication, the software they build is less disparate and more seamless.Contrarians such as Pivotal‚Äôs McKenty, however, have repudiated this thesis, adopting the view that ‚Äòteams of any size work best when they‚Äôre cohesive.‚Äô Recent research appears to reinforce this view. A collaborative effort that transcends ecosystems, in fact, inoculates against the threats posed by Conway‚Äôs law such as individual team goals surpassing overarching project goals.Humans and AI working together isn‚Äôt the only collaboration that is augmenting current capabilities. An Inter-Organisational Alliance (IOC) that transcends traditional organisational boundaries is an equally exciting venture.IOCs afford a plethora of possibilities. Firms can benefit from the twofold nature of social capital ‚Äî intra-team bonding and inter-team bridging. Tensions arising during the collaborative process can be repurposed to enhance the collaborative impact. Damage done by potent disruptors can be ameliorated.By creating embedded teams spanning organisations, an inter-connected, dialogical and combinatorically creative space is created, which serves as a proponent for innovation.These patterns have already been adopted by several organisations.Eventbrite relentlessly listens to customers, and based on the feedback, makes iterative improvements to its services ‚Äî a practice which has seen the company grow from a small ticketing platform to a billion-dollar enterprise.The New York City Open Data for All initiative embraces transparency by making data available to the wider public, allowing people to become active agents when it comes to reaping the benefits of data.Accenture‚Äôs Digital Hub in Madrid offers a collaborative space for businesses seeking to leverage emerging technologies, cultivating an environment conducive to innovation.In a high-velocity world, technological advancements necessitate not only a digital transformation but a concomitant cultural shift ‚Äî firms must change the way they communicate to avoid organisational inertia. Drawing inspiration from software design, organisations can successfully effectuate change in the post-digital era.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,5,1050,696,1,0,0,25,59

What Made You Good Is Not Always Enough to Make You Great,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/what-made-you-good-is-not-always-enough-to-make-you-great-b49668d74661,Thomas Plummer,4000,6,1176,"We often learn the critical lessons we need to survive as a small business owner in the harshest ways possible. We read about business techniques, study and talk to other owners who have gone before us, but despite the vast amount of business information out there, the important lessons we need to be successful over time usually come one beating at a time.One of these harsh lessons is learning that what makes you good as a business owner or manager is not always enough to make you great. You can achieve success to a certain level, but then your business plateaus because you outrun your skill set. In other words, you just don‚Äôt have the depth of information in your business head to solve every problem you now face.My client Samantha was capitalized, intelligent and possessed business experience in a few other small, but successful, startups. She knew how to make money, get projects done, and then create networks to sell.This new start was number four and her financial success in the previous decade pointed to yet another good company that seemed guaranteed to succeed.But after a few months on the ground, her business was broken. Every business saving technique she tried failed, and the best of her experience was not enough to solve the business breaking problems she was facing.We sat in her office arguing about the track of the business. She was fighting back on any suggestions or new ideas. ‚ÄúI have done this before and I know how to make a business work,‚Äù she firmly stated, ‚ÄúWhy would I change paths now after so much success doing these same things in my other businesses?‚ÄùThere is an in-your-face reality every small business owner or manager eventually faces where you understand what made you good in your business in the past is the thing keeping your business from being great today, and denying you success tomorrowSamantha became so enamored with her own skill set she refused to accept that everything in her business had changed except her. Past success can often prevent your business from evolving past what you know, and what you can do, to keep growing what you own to another level of financial success.The hardest part to understand, and to accept for many owners, is that all you know got you to this point of success, but you don‚Äôt know enough to solve the problems your business now faces that have stopped your growth.Here are a few indications you may be part of the problem, not part of the solution you need to be to be successful:Growth in small business often means you need to reinvent your company to stay current with tech trends, reinvest in equipment changes needed to attract and service future clients, and destroy a lot of the operational systems that were perfect ten years ago, but might prevent growth and competitiveness now.Owners trapped by their own limitations stay stuck with the what they know and protecting what they currently have. Why risk your current client base by instituting change when we can keep everything as it always was, so we don‚Äôt piss off any of the clients that have been loyal to us?The problem is the systems that attracted these clients years ago might be the same systems keeping new clients from considering you now. Price structures, dated support tech for the clients, and old, but inefficient staff that have been there for years are all comfort food for a long-term client, but while these things combine to keep current clients in the system, each one can be a roadblock to new business.Another sign your business is at a plateau is when you do everything you can to protect current profitability, instead of looking to reinvest in a long-term solution that might provide for bigger growth and revenue.Businesses outgrow their assets. The million-dollar investment you made in tech and equipment five years ago may be obsolete now, but it still works well enough to service the clients who have grown up in your company using those old tools.Owners seeking growth will reeducate their current clients, make concessions for the inconvenience, yet still take a lower profit now to build a company that will represent a new generation of client years from now.Existing on what you know ends. There is always a time where what you know isn‚Äôt what you need to know to continue being successful.Your education evolves, or it becomes irrelevant to what you own and who you manage now.Small business owners fail when they refuse to seek what is next in their industry. ‚ÄúHow should we be doing it tomorrow?‚Äù is the question flatlined owners will not ask because this question challenges, ‚ÄúThis is how we always have done it, and that made this company successful.‚ÄùThere is always a path forward if you as a small business owner or manager will use what you know now as a foundation to ask better questions about what the future of your business should be.Workshops, successful similar businesses, consultants and even your own staff can often show you why your business is at a standstill, and where you need to evolve to next.If business is stalled, look at your current staff.Are they there because they have always been there, understand the old ways, and hate change as much as you do, or are they there because they challenge you, offer new ideas, and bring an energy to the business you must have to grow?Staff can, and often do, stay too long. We get comfortable with our old friends because they get things done as they always have, but none will challenge what the business needs to grow, because if the business changes, they too would have to change.Your staff was there to get you to this point of success, but they might not have what it takes to grow this business beyond their own skill sets. You can as easily outgrow their worth to the company as you can outgrow your own skills needed to create a company of tomorrow.If you grow, then the staff has to grow or go. We cling to people who have helped us become successful, but their need to keep doing what we have always been doing could be one of the biggest roadblocks to any future success.Small businesses operate under a continual growth model where you are targeting minimum growth numbers each year, or you become an owner trapped by past success who works hard to protect what you have now, and who settles for merely maintaining the same old numbers that have defined your business since your best years.If you want a better business, expect a time where what got you to this point of your success will not be enough to get you where you want to be.There will always be a day in your career where you outrun your own skill set. How you react to this epiphany ultimately determines whether you adjust and keep growing, or you fail stuck in a past cycle of success that is not repeatable.",18/07/2019,2,0,10,0,1050,700,1,0,0,0,417

Money is the one necessity that every business shares. Getting enough of it also happens to be the leading cause of failure.82% of businesses fail due to a lack of cash flow.If businesses know this, why don‚Äôt they do anything to rectify the issue? They sit around and hope the right customer or client walks in the door. I empathize, I‚Äôve been there myself. I figured if I delivered a quality product, clients would be busting down my door.Sometimes they were‚Ä¶Sometimes they weren‚Äôt. I learned that passive business development is what leads to cash flow issues.Sitting around and waiting for referrals and repeat business is unpredictable. You need to be more proactive if you want your business to survive (or thrive). My friend Cole from Honey Copy recently mentioned in his weekly email that he dedicates 20% of his day to marketing his business no matter how things are going.Sounds easy, right? It‚Äôs not.Building a daily habit is no small feat. It‚Äôs easy to let it slip when you‚Äôve got a full plate of business. What happens when you finish those projects and your plate is empty? That‚Äôs not the time to start marketing and sales. You have to find, woo, and then close business before seeing a penny.Slow your roll‚Ä¶Hold up before you run out guns blazing firing off marketing tactics in every direction. I hope this post inspires action, but let‚Äôs take some time to put a little strategy into our efforts. Firing bullets in every direction makes it unlikely that you‚Äôll hit the right target. You just end up wasting all your ammo (money and time).Consistently executing a focused plan is what leads to a finely tuned business development machine. Follow these 4 steps of the saturation method and you‚Äôll build a healthy stream of unicorn customers (wonderfully majestic creatures to be cherished and loved).Stop trying to think big. Everyone is not your customer. Narrow your market down to what Seth Godin defines as the Minimally Viable Audience. If you haven‚Äôt read about the minimally viable audience, stop reading this and go back to the previous sentence and click the link. I promise his short post is worth your time.Trying to speak to everyone is a recipe for speaking to no one. Here are a few simple prompts to define the right minimally viable audience:Answering these questions will help you paint a vivid picture of your minimally viable audience (MVA). Knowing who these people are will allow us to saturate them with the right message later.Repeated exposure to a consistent message drives recognition. Saying the same thing with the same language across every customer touchpoint will eventually make a message stick. How do you get everyone on your team saying the same thing?Write a script.Make it ridiculously simple by taking it down to one single sentence using the following prompt.We help __________ do ______________.Example: We help service businesses grow by connecting their brand, marketing, and sales strategies.A single sentence is versatile. One sentence can power your website, social media profiles, and sales pitch. In fact, it should power all of these things. Customers must see this message everywhere they look and hear it from everyone they speak with at your company.You‚Äôve identified who your minimally viable audience is, where to reach them, and what to say to them. Now it‚Äôs time to make them feel like you‚Äôre everywhere they look.By shrinking the world, this is possible with a little budget and a lot of sweat. I like to break this out into two complementary categories.Think of marketing like the farming portion of your efforts. You‚Äôll be planting seeds and growing an audience of people that can be harvested when they‚Äôre ready. Marketing will consist of paid and organic efforts. You‚Äôll want to capitalize on multiple marketing channels. A few regular channels to consider (but certainly not an exhaustive list) include:Here‚Äôs an example sequence on how you can plant some seeds and start farming your fields:Google Ads & Social Campaigns: Set up Google Ads and social media campaigns targeting your niche. You can be amazingly specific with your targeting parameters on Google and almost every social channel. Determine what your people are searching and consuming and be there when they look with helpful information. For most businesses, the best action is to establish credibility and trust as a first step.Tradeshows: Attend the biggest tradeshow/tradeshows for your industry. Strategically invest in booth space and have a plan to stand out and drive engagement. Don‚Äôt just show up with the same lame presence as everyone else. Take the time to get creative and create a pattern interrupt.Direct Mail: Follow up after the tradeshow with a two-tiered direct mail effort.Tier 1: Legitimate Leads ‚Äî This mailer is for people who are real prospects. They stopped by your booth, showed interest, and fit your customer profile. Send these people a handwritten note, relevant gift, or another item that further captures their attention and starts to build the relationship. Include one clear call to action in the mailer for the next step they need to take. This step alone captured three Fortune 500 companies for my last firm.Tier 2: Show List ‚Äî This mailer is for everyone who attended the show. You‚Äôd be shocked at how many people walked by your booth and may be interested, but they didn‚Äôt stop to talk for whatever reason. Use this timely mailer to establish awareness and include a clear call to action that delivers value. Make them take a simple step that can be tracked to receive whatever that valuable item is. If they take this action, you know they‚Äôre serious and you can move them into the tier 1 group.Blogging: Post consistently to your blog and share with your network. Display your expertise and knowledge. Use your brand one-liner (script) that you created above as your editorial guide. Make sure everything you write relates to that single sentence. Continuously showcase your expertise and personality.This is obviously a quick overview, but you get the idea. Your little niche is going to see you everywhere they look. You‚Äôll go from zero awareness to industry fixture in months.Marketing is key to driving awareness and trust, but there‚Äôs no substitute for sales efforts. The sales team are the hunters paired with the farmers in marketing. Being in sales requires thick skin and relentless execution. Put your ear to the phone, fingers on the keys, and your boots on the ground.Sales aren‚Äôt dead as many have preached. I‚Äôd argue that an effective salesperson can be more useful today than at any time in history. It‚Äôs a matter of effectively complementing your marketing with the right sales efforts. Businesses don‚Äôt hire you, people hire you. People are influenced by emotion and relationships. Human interaction can be a powerful motivator. Learn how to leverage this to your benefit in sales.If your organization properly implements a marketing plan as outlined above, you‚Äôll be able to arm your salespeople with ripe leads. These salespeople will then be able to close these leads with a clear script that‚Äôs been provided in step 2. The combination of ongoing marketing cultivation with some human sales efforts leads to decision and action.The final step is to continuously remind people that you exist. My weekly email has been a fantastic tool for keeping me relevant to clients and prospects. Projects that would have otherwise gone to someone else are shot my way because they remember I exist and they need help in an area where I have expertise.Consistently execute a soft touch every single week. Don‚Äôt sell in this ongoing effort. Showcase your expertise.Simply showing up is a big part of winning new business.If you‚Äôre good at what you do, the saturation method will drive new business.

SMS #4: How to Put An End To Shitty Interviews,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/steal-my-startup-4-intervu-1e19d14ae970,Rayhan Memon,45,10,1836,"Before reading on‚Ä¶Note that this article by no means represents a comprehensive business plan. Rather, it is the foundations of a full model that I give you complete authority and ownership to build from. In plain English, if you‚Äôd like to ‚Äòsteal my startup‚Äô, go ahead.Have you ever had a negative experience when applying for a job or sitting through an interview? Was the experience negative enough to tarnish your opinion of the company?Once upon a time, I was in the final round of interviews for an internship at a large-scale tech company ‚Äî the ‚Äúwe-serve-lunch-and-have-an-unlimited-vacation-policy‚Äù type. I was told that I‚Äôd be on a video call with two of my potential managers (should I be successful) and that the interview would be conducted in two parts. For part 1, I‚Äôd be expected to present a software project I had worked on in the past and walk them through my code. For part 2, I‚Äôd be posed a challenge and given half an hour to solve it.Throughout part 1, I stuttered my way through my presentation of a simple robotics project I‚Äôd worked on in the summer. One interviewer was pounding away at his keyboard (definitely not taking notes, I assure you) while the other rested his head on his palm with his eyes shut. I tried my best to keep my cool and finished by asking if they had any questions about what I‚Äôd just presented. They said ‚Äúno‚Äù and bid me farewell without any mention of part 2 of the interview.As hard as I was on myself in the wake of that interview, I was way more critical of the company. ‚ÄúWe foster great personal growth in our employees‚Äù my ass‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt even care enough to finish my interview. It took a year and several more positive interactions with the company‚Äôs product and several of its employees before I finally wrote off my experience as an outlier.In the years since then, I‚Äôve turned an empathetic ear toward friends who‚Äôve complained about their negative experiences when on the job hunt and I‚Äôve come to find that incidents of unprofessional conduct can (and do) emerge in all stages of the application process.Candidates are stood up for calls and coffee chats.Candidates are treated poorly during interviews.Candidates are told ‚Äúthey‚Äôll hear back next week‚Äù but never hear back at all.As much as the hiring practices of some businesses adversely impact their applicants, it‚Äôs important that we frame this problem from the perspective of the businesses themselves in order to identify the opportunity.The fact is, businesses are always negatively impacted by their own bad behaviour. They rarely want to discourage candidates and they certainly don‚Äôt want the poor press that results from repeat incidents.There‚Äôs an opportunity here‚Ä¶Our assumptions:Before Reading On‚Ä¶Note that this article by no means represents a comprehensive business plan. Rather, it is the foundations of a full model that I give you complete authority and ownership to build from. In plain English, if you‚Äôd like to ‚Äòsteal my startup‚Äô, go ahead.Your company is hiring.A bright young woman has researched your mission, culture, and available roles and has placed your company at the top of her shortlist. She receives no follow up over the next week and so decides to reach out to your Talent Experience Specialist over LinkedIn to learn more. With no response on that front either, she assumes that her application was rejected and begins to expand her job search, taking a closer look at her 2nd and 3rd most favored companies. A few days later, an email from your company appears in her inbox inviting her for a video interview. At the scheduled time, she‚Äôs sitting at her desk, logged into google hangouts and waiting for someone to enter the meeting. 20 minutes later she receives an email from your Talent Team explaining how ‚Äòsomething came up‚Äô and offering a new time to chat. At this point, she‚Äôs a little fed up but believes it‚Äôs worth another shot. The last straw is drawn when at the rescheduled interview, her interviewer acts disinterested in everything she has to say. Annoyed and embarrassed, she accepts the competitive offer from that other company which treated her with more enthusiasm and respect.It‚Äôs upsetting to think that unprofessional conduct of this nature could happen at your company, but even more worrisome is the fact that if it were happening, you likely wouldn‚Äôt even know about it.In this hypothetical scenario, the cost to your business is not simply the loss of good talent. Your reputation is on the line. What if while reviewing her contract for her new job, she makes a stop at Glass Door to vent about her experience? What if her guy friend is curious about applying himself and asks for her opinion on whether or not he should?You have an entire marketing team whose whole purpose is to control the narrative surrounding your business, but when poor word-of-mouth and crippling Glass Door reviews are all it takes to drag your reputation through the mud, what good are the values you preach? The story you architect? The ‚Äòwinning culture‚Äô you promote?IntervU is here to intervene ‚Äî the first candidate-focused hiring software that provides your business with the tools necessary to hold itself accountable throughout hiring practices, cultivate more positive interactions with candidates, and provides you with the infrastructure to receive and respond to negative reviews before they go public elsewhere.At its core, IntervU works to increase a business‚Äô internal transparency and accountability when hiring. Clients create value for themselves as a result.To do just that, IntervU offers three main features: Interaction Tracking, Automated Interactions, and Feedback Management.It‚Äôs common practice for companies to distribute job postings across several platforms to get their roles in front of as many eyeballs as possible. Popular examples include LinkedIn, Indeed, and AngelList.I‚Äôm honestly unsure of the current tools and methods used by companies to sort, group and manage the submissions that come in from each of these platforms, but I can‚Äôt imagine that it‚Äôs an easy task.IntervU will take the incoming submissions from all job positing platforms for the client‚Äôs particular role and present that info in an ‚ÄòApplication Pool‚Äô.All key decision-makers for the role will be able to view the applicants and cast their votes for who should move on to sequential stages in the company‚Äôs interview process. This provides a visual and collaborative environment for employees to work together and determine the best fit for their open role.However, the most important reason for aggregating all submissions is to track interactions with each applicant.Given the login credentials for a designated point-of-contact email that is used for fielding questions and dispensing interview information (e.g. talent@yourCompany.com), the IntervU platform can track the interaction history with each applicant ‚Äî Gmail has an API (Application Programming Interface) that would allow you to do this.Unfortunately, in the case of coffee chats and other interactions not scheduled or facilitated via email, it may require manual input.Keeping an interaction history for each applicant is valuable for a few different reasons:The number of times I‚Äôve clung to the parting words, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get back to you Monday‚Äù but then Tuesday rolls around‚Ä¶having sat on the other side of the table several times before, I understand how these soft promises get broken.As justifiable as these reasons may be, they don‚Äôt change the fact that every day you delay engaging with your prospects is another day where your prospects weigh the pros and cons of other options.With IntervU automation, you can continue having personalized interactions with each of your applicants without taking your focus away from your other duties.Example use cases:And that last use case brings us to the final feature‚Ä¶‚ÄúWe all need people who will give us feedback. That‚Äôs how we improve.‚Äù ‚Äî Bill GatesIf you had the opportunity to stop a negative comment or review of your company from going public and poisoning the well, would you take it?IntervU puts the framework in place for you to do just that. Once an applicant is no longer engaged in the interview process ‚Äî either by being hired or rejected ‚Äî they will receive an automated email that links them to a feedback form. To encourage as much candor as possible, applicants‚Äô information can be anonymized if they so choose and applicants can also choose to not be contacted about their feedback.With proper use of this feedback, companies can either reach out to mend a damaged relationship and/or use feedback to improve internal processes and have important conversations with the personnel responsible for the incident.In my time working as Director of my university‚Äôs incubator, I hadn‚Äôt encountered any student-run B2B businesses (at least none that were making sales). That said, I don‚Äôt believe I have much authority to advise you on how to price a SaaS product like this. But if you‚Äôre interested, here are some of my suggestions:If you want more info, I found a good article on enterprise software pricing. You can view it here.Every business idea has its risks and shortcomings. Here are some for IntervU.Successful applicants, as well as unsuccessful applicants looking to apply again further down the line, may find difficulty in sharing their honest feedback for fear of being exposed.Unless IntervU becomes the ‚Äòindustry standard‚Äô and applicants become more and more familiar with (and, therefore, more trusting of) the software, I can‚Äôt think of ways of ensuring that applicants believe in their anonymity.It‚Äôs likely, however, that the most important feedback will result from the most critical cases of mistreatment. I‚Äôm confident that in these cases, disgruntled applicants will be ready and willing to share their unfiltered feedback.Coffee chats, phone calls, interviews. These interactions deserve more than just a ‚Äòdate & time‚Äô in an applicant‚Äôs interaction log. Having employees self-report the details of these interactions will be (1) tedious; (2) incomplete; and (3) biased.One way around this would be to have an audio recorder built into the web/mobile app that allows employees to simply record interactions as they happen. However, I imagine many applicants wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with being recorded.IntervU features may require API support that doesn‚Äôt exist.For aggregating all application submissions from all job posting platforms, it would require API support from these platforms in order to pull this information. I haven‚Äôt done enough research to know if these API‚Äôs exist and if they would even have the needed functionality.Another way of getting all application submissions in one place would be to include a link to ‚Äòapply through IntervU‚Äô in every job posting. This would require that a job application portal be developed for IntervU.Typically I‚Äôd use this section to ask for your assessment of my approach. But for this particular idea, I‚Äôm curious to hear of any application/interview horror stories you may have. For the CEO‚Äôs and founders out there, is this a solution you‚Äôd use?Let me know in the comments.Thanks for taking the time.

Inner source ‚Äî Open source benefits your company,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/inner-source-b6c9e73cb8dc,Raphael Yoshiga,462,6,1046,"We keep seeing impressive achievements by the open-source community, those projects are composed of people from different places and backgrounds, still, they manage to collaborate and create awesome products like Redis, NodeJs and React. How are they doing this and how can I do it at my company?Open source means code that is open for everyone to read and propose changes, those projects mostly without profit objectives bring together people that want to collaborate towards one objective. Amazingly they have accomplished a lot.The open-source community has decades of matured practices and guidelines to promote collaboration. Here are some of the practices we can use inside our companies.As the development majority happens remotely, the only way to convey knowledge around the product is to have great documentation. The documentation can happen in 3 places in general:A more traditional approach, where the documentation is put into some CMS to be displayed to users.Are you going too fast to write documentation? Instead, we can have ‚Äúpassive documentation‚Äù instead of separate steps for documenting it, the documentation happens as part of the collaboration process through issues discussions and Pull Requests.That‚Äôs where the big chunk of collaboration happens, whenever experiencing an issue against an open-source project, developers can open ‚Äúissues‚Äù which can be classified and discussed as:As the code is open, whenever experiencing an issue with a library, you might be able to identify what needs fixing yourself, so instead of waiting for a bug fix, you can fix it yourself and send a pull request to it. The project owners them can then review and give feedback:In our companies, this would be a channel of feedback cross teams.This file is a convention for the GIT repositories, it‚Äôs basically the home page of the repository, where there will be information around the function of the project and basic usage.As the code is ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù it means many developers will be able to read, the commits are done against the developer name, so people tend to be a little bit more cautious comparing to only commits their team sees.Distributed collaboration also comes with a few challenges, whenever someone new is joining the project, we won‚Äôt have the chance to sit by his side to ‚Äúset up the environment in his machine‚Äù, so the project needs to compile and run with the minimum set up. There is a file to help with this:Contributing.MDOn a contributing.md you can expect useful information into how to contribute to the project, for example:With so many different contributions happening in many parts of the code, test coverage is very important. Ensuring the behaviour you created is tested so it isn‚Äôt broken by accident by someone else is vital.Sometimes a Silos culture is created between departments in an organization:When one department needs a change from another department responsibility, a ‚Äúchange process‚Äù needs to be followed. Even if the change is only 5 minutes to be done, prioritization and negotiation happen between the departments.I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes on a previously owned API, a simple adding two properties to an API response was in the change negotiation process for two months. The development team would do it in 30 minutes, from coding to deploying to live.So depending on the size and complexity of the change, instead of asking for a change the developer can send a pull request for the other‚Äôs team codebase, likely getting a much shorter cycle time for that feature. As an additional benefit knowledge has been acquired from the other Silo and a collaboration link has been established.Is also very common in the Silos culture where departments start to compete internally.When there is a bug in another departments code, instead of raising the hands and complaining of how bad the other department is, the developer fixes the bug and sends the pull request.Instead of complaining about the bug, you got the chance to fix it.As everything that happens in the repositories are available to everyone to read, people can start building a reputation for themselves.Initially, an open-source project will have a list of Contributors, the people with permission to approve the pull requests. As time passes, people can earn the contributor hat after successfully collaborating in that project.Because everything is happening in commits, pull requests and issue discussions, collaboration is easy to be quantified. So would be easy to tell the developer with most:A warning towards gamifying those metrics, you will get what you measure it. If you measure pull requests, for example, you will get a lot of small PR‚Äôs.With so many people collaborating together, friction is inevitable to happen, so having a code of conduct can help it ensure people treat each other with mutual respect. Twitter code of conduct.Some good rule examples:With all those techniques to allow people to collaborate remotely, that‚Äôs perfect for organizations that want to scale above one central development place.Yes! Of course, if there are security concerns around confidentiality you might block specific projects. You also need to confirm the repositories don‚Äôt contain sensitive secrets themselves.This read access will also help developers to move across teams, as they can have knowledge of other departments inner workings before moving teams.Those are some of the companies that have been open about using those practices:The pioneer in doing this was Paypal, which you can see the movement pioneer doing a talk here.But in my opinion, an impressive adopter of those practices is Microsoft. Microsoft used to be corporate, not just corporate, but very corporate. They were the kind of company where some departments weren‚Äôt allowed to share secrets with one another, leading to delays in product launches. They had the .net Framework, which was private for them.And now they have a completely different culture, being evangelised by Satya Nadella their new CEO. They created .net core, which is the open-source version of, .net framework, with many improvements of course. They bought GitHub the main open-source community.You can see for example how they are building their .net machine learning open source here.The open-source community has a lot of experience in creating a collaborative environment, we can learn from them on how to provide good documentation, culture, feedback guidelines and code standards. And then leverage those practices to our businesses.For a world of more transparency and collaboration.Credits and resources for your inner source journey:",18/07/2019,0,0,4,0,965,661,8,4,0,15,9
5 Tips to Recognise Bad Criticism,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/5-tips-to-recognise-bad-criticism-2ffc717ad121,R Munford,360,8,1620,"As a writer I‚Äôve received a lot of feedback over the years, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned.As a writer, I‚Äôve received a lot of feedback. As an employee in communications and retail, I have received a lot of feedback. As an undergraduate student, I‚Äôve received a lot of feedback.Like most people, I‚Äôve had criticism handed to me in a variety of different ways.I have had criticism that has made me want to curl up into a ball in shame because I‚Äôve done something so wrong. I have also had criticism that has been unfair, and pretty mean.Now I‚Äôve gone through roughly 8 years of work and study, I have developed a good system for detecting empty criticism and valid criticism.Most companies now require for employees to sit through reviews which can be, depending on the manager leading the review, incredibly boring. Most managers and mentors will speak their mind then say things that made you embarrassed, and ashamed.Before we get to the tips I want to be clear: criticism and being able to take criticism is an important part of development. No matter your career, you will received criticism at some point and you need to learn how to hear it without being defensive. If something is wrong, do you want to ignore it? No.I used to refer to empty criticism as bad criticism but since reading so many other people who protest that title and say that all criticism is a good thing, I thought it would be better to simply call this problem empty criticism.Empty criticism is feedback that you receive that is inapplicable to your life and your goals. It also covers the criticism you receive that is general and honestly pointless. For example, you are working a temporary job and your boss has to talk about ‚Äúfuture goals‚Äù when you‚Äôve got 2 weeks left.Another example of empty criticism is (this is writing specific) a tutor tells you to add another character to a story that is already over its word limit and you know that the character would be detracting from the plot.I usually find that empty criticism comes from a person who just has to say something, not because it‚Äôs useful or hurtful but they feel they need to just have their piece. You know the type of person I‚Äôm talking about.Professionally speaking, in an education or workplace if someone attacks your character then this is not criticism, in my experience. This is usually the outburst of someone who is looking for someone to blame, has anger issues, is stressed or is unable to detach work from worker. Or it‚Äôs someone that no matter what you do, they do not approve of your work.Managers who attack an employee for being mean, or any other negative insult, without cause such as a complaint from another staff member, have a problem with not only perspective but also compassion. In general I find that many managers struggle with acknowledging their subordinates as people which leads to most breakdowns in communication.If a manager, or teacher, tells you that you are:Then this is a personal problem and is not criticism.This is a personal attack.PSA: Do not let people in positions of power think they can treat people like emotional punching bags because they can‚Äôt be professional.If this is your situation, please consider other options to deal with the situation on a professional level. If a union is available to you, join it. If the manager wants to discuss these pieces of ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô, formally request to have everything written down or recorded.These five tips are more questions to help you be able to find the truth in what feels like a hate-on-you parade of feedback. Criticism doesn‚Äôt have to be negative but negative criticism is not a bad thing. We‚Äôre human, we mess up and we need other people to provide perspective on what we‚Äôre doing.If you answer no to all of these questions then the criticism is empty. If you answer yes, you should consider the criticism carefully and create a plan on how to improve.1.Is what they‚Äôre saying specific?If the answer is yes, listen carefully to the criticism and make sure you can see exactly where this criticism applies.If the answer is no, you can still find some value in what is being said. For example, if they are telling you need to narrow your focus but don‚Äôt refer to a specific task, this probably means that your focus in general is too wide. They‚Äôre telling you that you need to be more focused on every task you do and to stick to your main goals instead of being lost in smaller, or less applicable, tasks.2.Can you understand where they‚Äôre coming from?Does the criticism come from a place of concern? Or come from a place of observation? Can you think of situations where this criticism is valid? Have you honestly noticed yourself that this is an issue?Writers often know when something is wrong with a piece and most of us do know when we‚Äôve not given our usual effort in a job.If you can‚Äôt understand where they are coming from and can‚Äôt think of any situation that applies to the criticism then look elsewhere for help.Ask a supportive coworker, fellow student or friend to give their honest opinion. Ask someone you know who you can trust to be honest but not hurtful. If more than one person states that you can have, as an example, a condescending tone then it‚Äôs time to reflect on your behaviour.If everyone is shocked by the criticism and doesn‚Äôt understand it either, it‚Äôs empty criticism.3. Is it about the present?If the answer is no and it‚Äôs about the past then it‚Äôs not helpful.Managers referring to examples of behaviour or work quality from 6 months prior are not helping you now especially if you‚Äôve changed. If 6 months ago you were late for a full week due to family problems and have now been on time since, then your manager stating you‚Äôre always late is irrelevant.Tutors stating that previous work was ill-structured when you‚Äôve handed them an essay which is well-structured is also empty criticism. If you‚Äôve improved, and that‚Äôs what they are referring to then that‚Äôs a compliment and not really criticism.4. Is it objective?This brings us back to personal attacks but there are exceptions. If you have a tense relationship with your manager and you do dislike them greatly then your behaviour may be less than perfect towards them. Accepting that you have been unprofessional is hard but if you want to improve then you have to accept it.Also when it comes to graduates starting roles in companies where not everyone has a degree or that experience, they may feel attacked by criticism that the work they are doing is not great.When you‚Äôve trained in university or college to do a specific career, it can be infuriating to hear that you still don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. If the critic can give examples and illustrate their points then listen because even with 4 years of university behind me and experience working in communications as well as research, there are still things I don‚Äôt know how to do to an expert level. University has given you the knowledge but in the workplace it‚Äôs a different application of that skillset. As long as the criticism involves examples then you should listen. If it doesn‚Äôt refer to anything in particular, then it‚Äôs probably empty criticism and could even be a personal attack‚Ä¶5. Can you apply this criticism?They can say you could have done (insert task) better but if it can‚Äôt be applied to any future work then it is an unhelpful statement to make. If you had to do graphic design and will never have to do it again due to a new hire then discussing how you messed up is bit pointless. You‚Äôll never have to do that again and it‚Äôs not in your skillset.If the criticism doesn‚Äôt help you work towards your goals then it‚Äôs empty. Encouraging you to go for workshops in a skill that is not applicable to your role or career progression is waste of everyone‚Äôs time.Whether or not the criticism has value, if it is done in person you should always respond professionally. If you disagree with a piece of criticism then do not argue with the person ‚Äî try to understand where they‚Äôre coming from and what made them say that piece of criticism.Taking time to come back and re-read written criticism is a really healthy way to deal with it because it gives you distance to understand the truth behind the words instead of taking a gut reaction. Often I have returned to emails from editors with less than satisfactory words to say about my work to find some value in their feedback.Of course, I have also returned to feedback and still found it incredibly irrelevant or vague or worse impossible (i.e. restructuring and completely rewriting a story to be an entirely different piece of work with a new storyline).As I said previously, if someone is attacking you on the basis of personality without a cause then you must pursue it through official channels to have the situation rectified or you‚Äôve got to remove yourself from the situation if possible.When responding to any form of criticism, take a breath, do a quick check with these questions and try to create steps you can take to improve. Don‚Äôt shut down. Don‚Äôt freak out. And don‚Äôt tell yourself you‚Äôre a failure.No one starts off great at anything and sometimes you need the harsh truth to get stronger, and more importantly to improve.Just take a deep breath, and don‚Äôt get defensive.Most of the time, people are just trying to help. Just listen.medium.commedium.commedium.com",18/07/2019,0,0,15,4,1050,700,3,1,0,10,70
Medium Success,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/medium-success-c911869fabbe,Tonja Vallin,1200,3,617,"I quickly started having success on Medium shortly after I signed up and so I naturally told my writer friends about the platform. Several seemed excited about the opportunity but only about 25% of them actually signed up which surprised me.So of the few that did sign up, the ones that had success had a few things in common. I truly want you to give this platform an opportunity to work so here goes.Write about subjects you are passionate about and have some broad appeal. Maybe it‚Äôs finance, relationships, writing or how to start a business. People wake up at night and have real world problems, they sometimes turn to Medium to help them with those problems so think about what you know and how you could help them. You may be really excited about your weekend hiking excursion but if that‚Äôs what you are writing about, you aren‚Äôt going to get much traction because it‚Äôs not solving a problem.In the beginning stages of Medium, you should be reading much more than you are writing. I like to recommend a 5:1 ration. Read five articles, write one. When you like something clap, highlight or comment or all three! I like to follow a lot of people so I‚Äôm always getting exposed to new authors and subjects. Make an impact with people when you really like their article.If someone gives you 30 or 50 claps consider taking the time to go to their page and either read an article or leave a comment.You don‚Äôt have to clap if you don‚Äôt want to but I am often impressed with the level of undiscovered talent I find on someone's article that may have 3 claps and 22 followers. Hey, we all started there!Think about your bio, do you have a niche or a funny line that shows your personality.When people are deciding to follow you or not they are giving you about 5 seconds of their time.It‚Äôs important you don‚Äôt leave your bio blank or worse, write 3 paragraphs. Try something out for a few weeks and if that doesn‚Äôt feel right, change it. You‚Äôll eventually stumble onto what works.Your title is so important. I‚Äôve mentioned this before in previous posts but it bears repeating. Study other titles on Medium and jot down the ones you are drawn to. What specifically is it about them that makes you want to read them. When I first started I thought I would be clever and cute and wrote titles like How to Win an Argument with Your Spouse. It was tongue in cheek and seriously about how to improve your relationship. When I rewrote and retitled the article it was curated and became one of my most successful posts.Not every article is going to be a home run. I have articles that make me $3.67 and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs okay, you are not going to hit a homerun every time. The key is to always write about what is interesting to you or helpful to others and that way no article is ever wasted.One article I recently wrote that hasn‚Äôt done all that well is When You‚Äôre Lonely‚Ä¶..do this. The upshot, I have received some amazing and wonderful feedback on that piece and doing the research actually helped lift me out of a very sad place.So there you have it, just a few more tips to put you on the road to making money while writing content. I‚Äôd love your feedback. Are there any areas you are struggling with or have questions about regarding Medium? Let me know in the comments section.

"Hey, You‚Äôre Forgetting About Your Down Time",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/hey-youre-forgetting-about-your-down-time-793c5a867350,Tessa Palmer,3000,3,529,"I‚Äôm flying out to the U.S. on Wednesday. It‚Äôs an international flight with not one, but two, connections and two lovely long layovers of 3‚Äì4 hours. (Yes, I choose a bad route to save $400‚Ä¶)Regardless, I started thinking about what I should do during my layovers.With 3‚Äì4 solid hours at each airport I thought it would be a good chance to catch up on one or two things.I could do some writing, I thought, or squeeze in an hour or two of work.I‚Äôll have my laptop (it follows me everywhere) and there will be wi-fi, so it will be easy to find a good spot to set up shop for a while.I sighed, thinking that Wednesday was going to be a rubbish day of travelling and working.Now, wait just a second.I‚Äôm about to go on vacation for a week.Vacation!This is not how I used to feel on the day I was traveling on vacation! I used to be excited to travel, the prospect of a week away a lucky dream come true. Airports were fun places to play games, splurge on eating out and browse through duty-free stores. I would chat to friends, buy a magazine, walk around.Work in an airport? That doesn‚Äôt sound like the start of a vacation!Gone are the days when work ended at 5pm. In fact, the workday hardly exists any more because we all have one or two side-hustles that we could spend an infinite amount of time on. Our whole day can be a workday if we let it.At any given time there is always something to do, because the truth is we can do anything from anywhere.As I mentioned, my laptop comes with me everywhere so at any point during the day it is easy for me to fire up my computer and crank out some work. Or work on my side business. Or write. Or research marketing techniques. Or clean up my inbox. Even on my phone I can connect to all my workstreams and do little bits of work here and there in the pursuit of success.That doesn‚Äôt mean I should though.In an environment that makes me stressed, why am I adding to the stress by trying to knock some work-related things out at the airport?I know; it can be tempting to stay connected all the time. Yet we need to be careful that we take time to do nothing at all sometimes as well.We shouldn‚Äôt forget that down-time, and enjoying down-time, is a great part of life.Whether it‚Äôs in an airport, on a saturday or 8pm at night, you should make sure that you actually do get to enjoy your down-time.This can include doing nothing, playing a few games or generally just enjoying yourself ‚Äî however you want to have fun and relax.It‚Äôs time to rethink my travel day.Just because I have pockets of time doesn‚Äôt mean I have to be doing something. In fact, I can do nothing at all. And by jolly, I think I will.So, I‚Äôve downloaded a game for my iPad and have chosen a new novel from my bookshelf to read. I am already looking forward to my journey day a whole lot more!",18/07/2019,3,0,0,7,1050,712,2,0,0,5,222
Be Brave!,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/be-brave-23c663c662c,Nikki Tate,1500,5,519,"The day I handed in my resignation from my comfortable government office job ranks right up there among the most terrifying of my life. My supervisor (who I liked and got along with well) looked me up and down. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou know what you‚Äôre giving up?‚ÄùAs if I didn‚Äôt know. With that letter I was waving my pension good-bye, I‚Äôd no longer have dental care, and if I was ill, there would be no more calling in sick without losing pay. There would be no more free training seminars, no more internal hiring opportunities, no more built-in social circle of people I had come to know well and whose company I thoroughly enjoyed.My supervisor wasn‚Äôt done. ‚ÄúWhat about your daughter?‚ÄùOh, drive in the knife and give it a twist.Yes, I was a single mother raising a bright, athletic, outgoing kid who needed new soccer cleats and who went to a private school and for whom I wanted only the best that money could buy. And here I was, tossing all that away for a chance to make a living as a writer.‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you afraid of what might happen?‚ÄùI know my supervisor was only trying to be helpful, to stop me from making a terrible mistake, but to my mind, staying in a safe, secure job until I could take early retirement was not my idea of how I wanted to spend my life.Was I scared when I penned that letter of resignation? Hell, yes. Having been raised by a pair of artists, I knew very well just how tough it was to make a living in the arts.

Compassion. Imagination. Vulnerability. Empathy.,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/simplifying-organizational-transformation-676a7322f2f8,Daniel DAlonzo,349,6,1041,"Imagine a world where we wake up excited to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.Where we work cooperatively in the community to design a sustainable way of life. Where we unlock the intrinsic motivation to transform our circumstances into meaningful opportunities. Where we intentionally cultivate superpowers like compassion, vulnerability, imagination, and empathy to elevate the collective consciousness, instigate cultural evolution, and move the world forward.‚ÄúMaking things better. Taking responsibility and creating a positive cycle of generous action. Leading by example. Finding a small corner where you can make a difference, and then making a difference.‚Äù -Seth GodinLeaders want to find and attract talent, align teams with strategy, get the most from their people, and create a great environment for people to thrive. Yet, employees are unhappy, burnt out, career transitioning, and feel disconnected. There seems to be a disconnect between the intent of leadership, and the people who make-up these organizations.I had conversations with CEOs, founders, creatives, young professionals, small business owners, and people in career transition. There were common pain-pointsMy hypothesis is that people have accepted a culture handed down to them. As a result, they exist in an organization, and perhaps a society, that may not look and feel as if it were designed specifically for them. Culture change initiatives from leadership and incumbents are issued to employees and the people as new processes to ‚Äúorganically adopt‚Äù from the bottom-up. Felt as forced, these initiatives are ineffective in returning on the financial investment and the people inside the company feel further disconnected.Existing cultural diagnostic tools measure people against finances. They are built from a paradigm that exists to reward individual behavior. This further silos people and pits them against one another ‚Äî both of which are not conducive to nurturing a healthy, collaborative workplace.On the organization‚Äôs side, I mapped the existing journey of a leader who is aware of organizational problems, is convinced of the financial benefit of ‚Äúfixing the culture‚Äù and is ready to pay for a solution.There‚Äôs clearly a lot going on in this mess. Rather than take on competitors in a crowded space, I felt inclined to scrap the old paradigm. Instead, offer human-first purpose-driven transformation.It appears that organizational transformation starts with the leader adopting new operating principles for herself, and, in doing so, models the ideal behavior she hopes to cultivate in the culture.To lead others, lead yourself. It starts with you looking inward, developing an adaptive mindset, opening yourself up to continuous learning, going out of your way to give credit, and modeling what extreme ownership looks like.Get on a path of personal development and spiritual enlightenment. It does not start by deciding your organization is going to ‚Äúchange‚Äù. If you want to see change, change yourself.Invest time in one-on-one conversations with the people in your organization. What are they going through? What are their values? Do they feel aligned with the company? Do they feel like they contribute to important decisions?What would a conversation look like where you are co-creating the future together?What would it look like for you to foster a culture of innovation that is safe, judgement-free, rewards collaboration more than individual metrics, quickly adopts microstructures to keep pace with unplanned activities, and makes people feel like they are connected with their peers and are an accurate reflection of the culture of the organization?How might you provide on-going moments for your people to explore new experiences individually and as a team? How might you create a safe space to facilitate deep, meaningful connection with one another? What would it look like for the people on your teams to feel the autonomy to create the experience for themselves?Imagine a workplace where we focus on developing a sense of self, having autonomy, and aligning with one another to actualize our purpose in the work we do in the world.A place where people are intrinsically motivated to give their blood, sweat, and tears because they have ownership and feel one with the organization, and society. A place where people connect deeply with their peers, where trust is developed and strengthened overtime, and people show up excited to be apart of an extraordinary movement.I see a workplace where people intentionally cultivate superpowers like compassion, vulnerability, imagination, and empathy to elevate the collective consciousness, instigate cultural evolution, and move the world forward.Superpowers like vulnerability and empathy are gifts a person receives from experiencing a moment of transformation. Humans thrive when they cultivate superpowers. These gifts continue to increase in demand as they are not available transactionally, and this makes them competitive advantages.How might we design an experience for people to cultivate superpowers, actualize their best self, and surround themselves with inspiring people who want to see them grow?In order to be customer-centered teams, we must have the capacity to act without ego and get out of our own way so customers feel safe bringing issues to us. To act without ego requires us to feel safe being ourselves and show up in our most authentic version. This requires organizations to foster collaborative performance metrics on projects only achievable through the collective act of a team. Teams become cohesive when there is an intentional culture of creative conversations, acknowledgement, and a safe space is created for discussing any tension that arises along the journey.We feel similar pain-points across society. Regardless of role or position in the hierarchy, there is a common thread of feeling disconnected, purposeless, and alone. We implement processes and steps and when we impose these rigid structures on human beings, it is felt and we‚Äôre seeing more resistance begin to unfold.It reminds of that saying. It talks about putting round pegs in square boxes, or something like that. To clarify, perhaps the problem is neither in the hands of the leader nor the team. Perhaps it‚Äôs about the context, the paradigm, the worldview, and framing a person has while living, operating, and trying to evolve from within the systems that oppress you.My individuality is what makes my human experience so special. Invite me to a place where I am expected to be myself. A place where we celebrate each of us being ourselves. A place where we celebrate being human. Do you see that place?Sending you love from my heart to yours.Daniel",18/07/2019,0,0,13,1,637,292,2,7,0,1,77
You Already Know the Next Move in Monetary Policy,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/monetary-policy-201907-2fa97a2f123f,Duino S.,195,6,1271,"At the end of July 2019, the Federal Reserve will decide once again what to do about interest rates.What‚Äôs going on in monetary policy?The FED has clearly become more accommodative in conducting monetary policy. While this gives some oxygen to the markets in the short-term, it creates many risks for investors over the longer term because, like it or not, they are seriously manipulating the economy and this may eventually lead to a bad end.Right now, there is a rising sentiment towards a rate cut, this is also confirmed by the FED‚Äôs declarations from the last meeting. If this will happen, it might give another short-term push to the economy but at the end of the day it means lower room to maneuver when the next recession comes.This kind of behavior creates both a risk and an opportunity for the the long-term investor because, given how things are playing out, they may eventually lose control on monetary policy.Let‚Äôs analyze all those facts in details.Monetary policy‚Äôs job is to balance the economy, making sure that jobs and wages growth is increasing as much as possible without ‚Äúoverheating‚Äù and translating into an unsustainable rise in the inflation rate.The Federal Reserve always stated that they are paying close attention to economic data in making their decisions on monetary policy. That‚Äôs fine, but what should get your attention is the general change in their strategy:It is clear that in the last few years monetary policy became one of the main drivers of economic growth.Understanding that is a key to correctly frame our economic environment and make investing decisions.The following chart shows the level of interest starting from the 1960‚Äôs, definitely more interesting than the 0.25% increase or cut in short-term interest rates.What this chart shows it that the world has seen declining interest rates since 80‚Äôs. In the recent years, just the small hike from zero to 2.5 has already produced effects on the economy, in fact the FED is already thinking that the new neutral rate could be lower than they thought (2.5‚Äì3%).In the years, Government, Businesses and Consumers got more and more debt because it was cheap and now we find ourselves highly leveraged in every area. There is an extremely indebted environment that is a critical element of fragility in the whole system. Things didn‚Äôt really improved since 2008, we could argue that they are worse indeed.Now, given the fact that everyone has debt, the following cause-effect relationship is true:Even a small increase in interest rates has a big effect on the economy, consumptions and investmentsThis has huge implication for the economy, but before analyzing the impact, let‚Äôs check what is the FED view on current monetary policy.If you check the June 2019 meeting minutes, there is a ton on insights on what is going on and especially on how fast things are changing. If you are an investor, you can‚Äôt afford not to pay attention to this stuff and decide how to reposition your portfolio accordingly.So, what to expect in the near future of monetary policy?When talking about the outlook for monetary policy, ‚Äúnearly all participants had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the projection period in their SEP sub-missions, and some had marked down their estimates of the longer-run normal level of the funds rate as well.Many participants indicated that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy had strengthened. Participants widely noted that the global developments that led to the heightened uncertainties about the economic outlook were quite recent.Many judged additional monetary policy accommodation would be warranted in the near term should these recent developments prove to be sustained and continue to weigh on the economic outlook‚ÄùIn other words, they are talking about stimulating the economy now, with unemployment at record low, after 10 years of expansion, with low interest rates and still a quite decent economic growth, in fact:‚ÄúSeveral participants noted that a near-term cut in the target range for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects of possible future adverse shocks to the economy‚ÄùAt this point, we shouldn‚Äôt have doubt about their intentions of lowering interest rates and keep the economy going. That is exactly what has been done in the last few decades and it is what brought debt to frighteningly high levels.The Fed has historically needed to cut interest rates by 4 or 5 percentage points to combat recessions. But it‚Äôs currently setting them at 2.25 to 2.5 percent. That‚Äôs already too low, and if the Fed starts cutting now, it will have even less room to maneuver when the next downturn comes.Playing this game of manipulating the economy through lower and lower interest rates brings to undesired consequence: the FED will eventually lose control over interest rates as they won‚Äôt be able to use this lever to further stimulate the economy through monetary policy.Why should that happen?In the years, debt was used to stimulate growth instead of increasing productivity, short-term debt cycles got bigger and bigger and now a huge long-term debt cycle towards its end is looming.Central banks will lose control because they are acting against nature: the economy works in cycles.When you create huge imbalances sooner of later they have to offset each others.You can postpone the problem as long as you manage to do so, but eventually it will go back to a cycle and a recession shows up, inevitably.Debt is the key. We saw how small increases in interest rates have big effects on the entire economy.In the 1960‚Äôs we had the same levels of interest rates as we have today, what happens now?Two potential outcomes are the following:Rising interest rates would mean causing the recession, but at the same time there is a limit for decreasing interest rates because you can‚Äôt go below zero, and this is where things are getting bigger:The next step is money printing, if this happens, you will see inflation.For those who have debt, inflation is actually a good thing because it makes it easier to buy debt, and since everyone has a high level of debt (Government, Businesses, Consumers) creating inflation would make a lot of sense, especially when the alternative is causing a recession.What does it mean for our long-term investments?Modern monetary policy is all about currency creation, in this process central banks will sacrifice currencies.The first takeaway is that we should be careful with currencies: it is ok to keep some cash but remember that is better to use it to purchase good investments when opportunities arises.The second, and most important takeaway is to be prepared for this kind of move. This involves creating a portfolio that involves real diversification and hedges, with good risk-reward investments and a long-term focus on the business.Markets are always short sighted, the real problem looming is that our economy could be headed into a severe recession that will have negative impact on consumptions and corporate earnings.It is not by chance that the FED always stress the rising uncertainty in the economy, nobody knows what will happen and things seems to be getting more and more fragile.What we know is that central banks will do whatever they can to keep the economy going and to avoid recession. This involves printing more money and over the long-term it will have strong macroeconomics implications.Originally published on moderntimesinvestors.com on July 18, 2019.Did you like this article?

Student Loan Crisis Bailout,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/student-loans-crisis-3793a579876,Kati Pierce,684,5,1011,"Americans owe over $1.56 trillion in student loan debt.‚Ää‚Äî Student Loan HeroAlmost five years ago, my student loan debt came crashing into my life not unlike the Kool-Aid Man crashing through a brick wall.After ignoring the letters and calls to pay back about $50,000 in Over 20 loans, accrued pursuing my business degree, my wages were garnished.I was suddenly given a crash course in income-driven payment plans, rehabilitation loans, and debt consolidation. All while 15% of my income was withheld from each paycheck.I was already struggling to make ends meet, but Navient did not care. I should have read the letters and answers the phone calls That came over the years. Maybe then they could have helped me.When I first applied to a private for-profit college, I never even thought about how I would eventually pay the loans back. Getting loans and grants was the normal thing that everyone did to further their education. Naively, it never even registered that one day I would owe over $50,000 and have to pay for it somehow.I spent the next nine months rehabilitating my loans via wage garnishments and small payments on loans that weren‚Äôt included in the garnishments. I was paying almost $700 a month because defaulted loans in rehabilitation are not eligible for income-driven plans.Once my loans were out of default, I was able to consolidate all but two of them. My credit report finally showed current payments, causing my credit score to raise AND I could get my tax returns again, before The Man scooped them up.I still owe (and make payments towards) tens of thousands of dollars on my student loans. Something that keeps me from being able to qualify for decent interest rates, a mortgage loan over $70,000, and from paying off other debts as quickly as I would like.(Okay, that last one is on me for accruing that debt, but I have to three items in my list or I can‚Äôt move on in my writing)What would I do if the student debt was all just gone?What if Elizabeth Warren cancels up to $50,000 of debt for everyone earning less than $100,000 per year. If the top 1% of the wealthiest people‚Äôs taxes paid for my loans?Or if Bernie Sanders raises trading fees and cancels out ALL student debt and forces state-run universities to drop tuition all-together?My credit score would go up! My debt-to-income ratio would be more balanced! Maybe, just maybe, I could buy a house for over $70,000 with a decent interest rate!Except, there is a nagging voice inside me that says:But won‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs?What will that look like nationally?Will the cost of living go up? Will qualifying for a mortgage become more difficult? Will interest rates skyrocket?Won‚Äôt these things look that same as they do now?If everyone‚Äôs student debt is forgiven 100% or almost completely, then aren‚Äôt we all still in the same boat no matter what, but with less nagging from Great Lakes? I mean if everyone is special, then no one really is special, right?!In a Bernie Sanders world of student debt forgiveness, everyone‚Äôs debt is wiped out. Universities are tuition-free for undergrads. This will all be paid for with investment fees.This means that those who left college without a degree, with the least debt and likely not paying on it anyway, will see no change, except maybe their credit score may go up a few points.Though we truly ahave yet to know how FICO scores will be affected by a mass culling of student debt.The top 33% of debtors are or were graduate students, such as doctors, lawyers, and other higher salaried positions (in the private sector). Their higher debt will be erased as they eventually (or currently) enjoy higher salaries.Retirement accounts funded by investments will now have fees attached when fund managers move money around. Penalizing the working class people planning for their future.The idea is that once student debt is gone, this will stimulate the economy. Student loan debt-holders can have kids, buy houses, and even take lesser-paying (but more desirable) jobs.We may see more public-sector positions filled like teachers, city attorneys, and social workers since, in theory, the worry of making large student loan payments will be gone and people can afford to work where their passions lie, rather than the most high-paying positions.On the flip side, we could find fewer nonprofit and government positions being filled, since those who are in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program would have their debt wiped clean before their 10 years of service is up. Public servants would be free to move on to the private sector sooner than planned. No one will really know for sure, unless student loan debt forgiveness actually happens.When I set out to answer the question of what the nation would actually look like after student debt forgiveness, I was hoping to pick a side in the student loan crisis debate.Unfortunately, I still don‚Äôt know where I stand on this. What I do know is that something‚Äôs got to give one way or another.I know that there is no single right or wrong way to help people drowning in debt from furthering their education, but some will argue that we got ourselves into this situation, agreed to pay the monies back when we borrowed it, and need to pony up. And that‚Äôs fair.But is it also fair to lend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to teenagers without jobs or collateral?Is it fair that college is so expensive that people have to borrow so much money just to maybe earn more money at a job in two to eight years?Is it fair that millions of people have already paid off their student loans through living frugally and being responsible, while others may get their loans paid for them?None of these are for me to decide for anyone else. Whatever our country decides, it is clear that a lot of changes need to be made to the entire college and career system. And it all starts with money. The same money that got us into this mess.",18/07/2019,5,0,1,1,933,565,6,0,0,1,32

‚ÄúAccidental‚Äù Sexism in the Service Industry,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/accidental-sexism-in-the-service-industry-77826558741f,Katelyn Kemmerle,19,5,1063,"As a young girl in the service industry, unfortunately, experiencing sexism is basically a part of my job description. I work in a movie theatre as a part of an all-white, all-male (except for me, obviously) management team, and the customers never let me forget it. Every time someone asks me ‚ÄúCan I speak to your boss, please?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you the manager?‚Äù ‚Äî even when I‚Äôm standing behind customer service in a suit jacket ‚Äî I die a little bit inside. They always give my coworkers more respect, stand up straighter when they introduce themselves, or listen to them when they repeat the exact thing that I just told them. For the most part, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on purpose. Of course, there have been a handful of unpleasant guests that have made their prejudice against women evident, but most of the time, I think it‚Äôs purely accidental.‚ÄúOh, I thought he was the manager.‚ÄùMy favorite story to tell people is about a time when one of my newest employees got mistaken for my boss. He just came in to see a movie that day, so he was wearing sweatpants, a t-shirt and a zip-up hoodie. Nothing too special. He was sitting cross-legged on a bench outside of the men‚Äôs room and I was talking to him about his day, asking him how he was adjusting to the new job. Meanwhile, I am in my full uniform ‚Äî gold name tag, suit jacket, and my hair up in a high bun. A gentleman approached us, and simply asked if it was possible to refund his movie ticket, as he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to make his showtime. I looked over at him, smile on my face, and said ‚ÄúOf course! I‚Äôll walk you over to our guest service desk.‚Äù And then, he looked at me dead in the face, and said, ‚ÄúOh, I thought he was the manager,‚Äù and gestured to the 18 year old boy in sweatpants, sitting on the bench in front of me. I was absolutely floored.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to sit here and listen to a little girl standing behind a desk.‚ÄùAnd, there are other times when customers attempt to patronize me, demean me, or act like they‚Äôre tougher than me. One time, a family of five was sent up to me at customer service after trying to take a four year old into a Rated R horror movie. If you know anything about the MPAA regulations, you know that any child, ages six and under, are not allowed into a Rated R film. So, the family comes up to me ‚Äî furious ‚Äî stating that they go see Rated R movies all the time, and that they need to be let into the movie. Of course, I apologize and say that they cannot go in, tell them I can give them a refund or tickets into a different movie. The father starts screaming, calling me names, and at the end of his tirade, he yells ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous, I‚Äôm not going to sit here and listen to a little girl standing behind a desk.‚Äù I could tell by the look on his face that he didn‚Äôt mean to say that out loud, but was definitely too proud to apologize.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt mean it that way. He‚Äôs actually a really nice guy!‚ÄùAnd, quite possibly the worst story I have to date ‚Äî the first time I met my brand new District Manager. I‚Äôve been a manager at this movie theatre since I was a senior in high school, and my location had cycled through about 3 different district managers up until this point. The other ones were very professional, and said hello to me every time I saw them. It was never really much more than that, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. Last year, it was announced that we were getting a new DM, and that he would be touring all of his new theatres within the week. So, when we were up for the visit, I was the customer service manager for the day. He walked in the front doors, and I recognized him instantly. I smiled, introduced myself, and held out my hand for a handshake. With a straight face, he looks at me and says ‚ÄúIs your general manager here?‚Äù, to which I replied ‚ÄúYes! I‚Äôll go get him for you‚Äù. Plainly, he looked at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find him myself.‚Äù I tried to shake it off, but had a really gross feeling lingering after our conversation ended. He was my boss‚Äôs boss. He was supposed to be professional. I chalked it up to him just being a little curt, and assumed he treated everyone that way. Boy, was I wrong. I watched him shake hands with the other members of the management team, smile, laugh and have a great time. It made me feel discouraged, and like I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be part of the boys club. He asked me questions about the theatre industry, and felt the need to explain to me why I was wrong. He asked my coworker the same question, got the same answer, and responded with a smile and nod. He clearly had no interest in what I had to say. When he left, I told my coworkers about my grievances with him. They responded with a consecutive ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt mean it that way. He‚Äôs actually a really nice guy!‚Äù.After I clocked out that day, I was upset ‚Äî but not at the blatant sexism from my superior. It was more so the fact that my coworkers didn‚Äôt see anything wrong in how he acted towards me. It‚Äôs hard feeling patronized by someone in a position much higher than you, but it‚Äôs even worse when it comes from the people on the same level as me.Whether prejudice is on purpose or ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù, it still cuts just as deep. Why is it such a wild idea that I, a twenty-something year old woman, can be a supervisor? Or enforce policy just the same as my male counterparts? Or shake the hand of my district manager? Sexism in the service industry will not stop thriving until we take the time to break it with our bare hands. It may take awhile to break into the boys club, but it will happen. We will get there.",18/07/2019,1,0,0,2,1050,700,1,0,0,2,75

She‚Äôd just taken over as the executive director of a small non-profit and, 45 days into the job, was overwhelmed with the amount of work facing her. She‚Äôd been charged with growing the organization ‚Äî raising awareness in the community, increasing revenue and professionalizing the operations. It was going to take a lot of work to turn them into the type of organization they wanted to be, but she was ready for the challenge. Her question to me was simple (but incredibly hard) ‚Äî where should she start?In an interesting twist of fate, she was the third person who‚Äôd taken me to dinner to ask me that exact question in the course of two weeks. (It was a good month for free dinner.) It seems that everyone around me is undertaking huge, career-changing projects and is feeling a bit underwater about it. They are all experiencing what I like to call entrepreneurial insomnia ‚Äî instead of sleeping, you lie awake thinking ‚Äúwe should have a new strategic vision!‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should create a Facebook ad campaign!‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs open an office in Peru!‚Äù And while all of those might be great ideas, and necessary ones, it simply isn‚Äôt possible to tackle them all at once. The only way to conquer an enormous task is to break it down into manageable pieces ‚Äî to eat the elephant one bite at a time.It‚Äôs a cliche, yes, but it is also true. You have a finite amount of resources ‚Äî time, money, energy, bandwidth ‚Äî and you have to make sure you are wringing every possible drop of upside out of them. If you start an ad campaign before you set a target audience, you will waste money and time and not see any result at all. Resource wasting is especially damaging if you are in Sarah‚Äôs position, having taken over an existing organization. If you stumble out of the gate on your first few initiatives, it will take months longer to gain the trust and buy-in of your team, if you ever do.So, how do you decide what to tackle first? Where should you put your resources to be effective? The tactical answer for everyone will be a little different, but the process for arriving at the answer will be the same.1. Set a baseline. So many organizations have no idea of their baseline ‚Äî where they are, right now, as a company. For Sarah, that meant she had to go back, dig into the numbers and figure out several things ‚Äî which fundraisers were the most effective, what everyone inside the organization was doing (and if there were gaps or overlaps in job duties), and what their reach was in the community. There was major analysis to be done so that a baseline could be established. Once the baseline exists, you know if your efforts are actually moving the needle.2. Pick a priority. No matter how amazing you are, you can‚Äôt do everything, and neither can your team. You have to look at the landscape, decide what project or idea will have the most impact, and then go all in on it. Use the data you secured in step one and get everyone rowing in that direction. Sarah started by setting a clear fundraising goal for the rest of this year. The organization hadn‚Äôt really had one before (‚Äúlet‚Äôs raise as much money as we can‚Äù is not technically a goal) and this represents a major step for them.3. Set up small wins. Anytime major change is coming to an organization, you have to begin with small projects that will create momentum. This is particularly true when you are the new sheriff in town. Setting up projects that guarantee positive results proves that you know what you are talking about and develops trust, so that when you undertake larger, more challenging initiatives, your team will believe in your ability to get them there. The biggest mistake I see new leaders make is to throw out some crazy-big goal that everyone knows is impossible and then get frustrated when the team fails to achieve it. Sarah chose a fundraising goal slightly higher than last year, but still very, very attainable. It is enough of a challenge that people will have to work to get there, but not so much that everyone feels demoralized before they start.4. Refocus everyone on the goal regularly. The longest anyone can hold onto a goal is 90 days. It‚Äôs why quarterly goal-setting is so important. You have to refocus and re-calibrate everyone at least that often, but I‚Äôd recommend doing it more frequently. Weekly staff meetings are a great time to call back to your number one priority and talk about how you are progressing toward it. For something as concrete as a fundraising goal, one of those fabulous old-school thermometers on the wall that people can color in with dry-erase markers when they receive pledges is fantastic. Give everyone on the team a different color marker, and turn that thing into a fund-raising rainbow!5. Celebrate the win. When you accomplish that first priority ‚Äî when Sarah‚Äôs organization raises the money they need to ‚Äî you need to break out the cake, champagne, pizza, whatever. The celebration needs to be raucous, immediate, and include everyone. Talk about how you did it, recognize everyone for their contributions, get a little messy and then‚Ä¶..6. Announce the next priority. Once everyone has sobered up and come out of the cake coma, have the next priority ready to go. You need to capitalize on the momentum of the first win and turn it into a second, and then a third. You‚Äôve proven that, as a team, you can accomplish things, so you want to keep accomplishing them. This also helps turn your culture into one of success and forward progress, which is always a good thing.Apply these six steps anytime you are facing a daunting challenge, and while it won‚Äôt make the work any easier, you‚Äôll at least stop the head-spinning insomnia and know where to focus your efforts.",18/07/2019,0,0,6,0,1050,697,1,0,0,2,34
How Do They Find Their Boundless Energy? ‚Äî Part 2,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-do-they-find-their-boundless-energy-part-2-c5af1b9c6932,Zach Arend,1100,6,1094,"Picture yourself early in the morning walking barefoot along the beach.You can hear the seagulls flying overhead, the waves crashing against the surf.The smell of saltwater is in the air. There‚Äôs sand between your toes, the warm orange light appearing on the horizon, and a cool breeze hitting your face.Pause and experience this for a moment. Do this now. Close your eyes and imagine it, really feel it.What if you could tap into this experience at the office or at home with the kids?You might be thinking, ‚Äúnot where I work‚Äù or ‚Äúnot my kids‚Äù. But it‚Äôs this present moment experience that leads to high-performance.If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are ‚Äî if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.JOSEPH CAMPBELLIn part 1 of this article, we established an energy spectrum. On the left is constrictive energy and the right expansive energy.The primary lesson: Avoiding stress, making judgments, brooding, fear, busyness, and excessive expectations all lead to constrictive energy.But what if you find yourself experiencing this low energy state more than you‚Äôd like to admit? You want to expand your energy and perform at your best, but you just don‚Äôt know how.You have the ability to choose the energy that serves you. Expansive energy results in joy, meaning, and high-performance.Expansive energy allows you to stay light on your feet.Most people live life weighted down by their thoughts, emotions, and external stressors. But those who have sustained success tap into expansive energy.They are more creative, intuitive, and are able to flow through life. They are able to achieve effortless high-performance.How do they do it? They‚Äôve adopted the following six mindsets. Here‚Äôs how you can too.Stress, pressure, anxiety, and insecurity are uncomfortable. Would we really choose these feelings over contentment, comfort, and peace?Naturally, you gravitate toward pleasure and away from pain. But to pursue what you want most in life, to be happy, and to engage in work that matters, you must press into the pain and discomfort.All great works, positive change, and success are formed in the fires of struggle.Ryan Holiday says, ‚Äúthe obstacle is the way.‚Äù This couldn‚Äôt be truer and over time what we avoid always grows into a bigger monster.Start by changing your relationship with stress. Embrace the suck and honor the struggle.With the right amount of stress and the right amount of rest comes growth, opportunity, and happiness.Go back to imagining your walk on the beach. This is what presence feels like.Notice there was no cell phone in your hand. You weren‚Äôt feeling guilty about the past or anxious about the future.You were engaging in the moment. And that‚Äôs all there is ‚Äî this very moment!Now is your opportunity. Will you choose to engage it or look for the nearest exit?Being present is a skill to develop. Start a mindfulness practice and experience what now feels like.‚ÄúLeadership is first being, then doing. Everything the leader does reflects what he or she is,‚Äù says Warren Bennis, author and founding chairman of The Leadership Institute. ‚ÄúTherefore leadership is about expressing yourself, not proving yourself.‚ÄùAll great leaders and influencers have something to express to the world. It goes beyond the dollar and prestige associated with such roles.There are those that have deep desires to create something meaningful. Others are simply driven by what they might gain.Entrepreneur Larry Wilson, author of Play to Win, defined ‚Äúthe difference between desire and drive as the difference between expressing yourself and proving yourself.‚ÄùIn what ways are you expressing your values in your work and life?Love and compassion have an energizing effect on you and others.Science shows us that gratitude, love, compassion, and kindness toward ourselves and others changes our brain. It‚Äôs the quickest way to emotional intelligence.Imagine not having these traits. Instead, you go through your day angry, frustrated, and annoyed by everyone around you. Exhausted yet?What if, instead, you were curious about others and looking for ways to lift their spirits and encourage their greatness?Your thoughts of compassion raise your level of energy and facilitate your staying connected to intention.WAYNE DYER, THE POWER OF INTENTIONKnow in advance how you want to show up for what‚Äôs ahead of you today.This is true of all high-performers. They prepare themselves for what‚Äôs ahead so they can use their energy to create the results they want to see.Here‚Äôs a simple and relatable example: You pull your car into the garage after a long day at work. You are about to step into your home where behind that door is those you love most. You pause to set your intentions. You ask yourself‚ÄùImagine how your evening at home would go if you did this more often?This is the power of intention.Those who experience high energy enjoy the process as much as the outcome.Loving the process is the game, not the shit the process will get you.@GARYVEE‚ÄúDoing the work has a special way of putting both success and failure in their respective places,‚Äù says Brad Stulberg author of The Passion Paradox. ‚ÄúAfter a massive achievement or a devastating failure, getting back to work serves as an embodied reminder that external results aren‚Äôt why you are in this.‚ÄùFor you to experience sustainable and boundless energy it‚Äôs the work you do that matters most. Do it for its own sake. When you do, the results that ensue might surprise you.How could you look at your life and work differently and enjoy the process more?You choose the energy you bring into your day. How often do you choose what constricts high-performance?Stress is part of the journey. Instead of running from it, lean in and be present with the entire experience of pursuing your dreams.Let go of the idea that you have to do more to be more. Express who you are.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.‚ÄùHOWARD THURMANShow compassion for others, live your life with intention and enjoy the ride you‚Äôre on.

He said I‚Äôd never make it as a writer,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/he-said-id-never-make-it-as-a-writer-f1895580b7b6,Paul Gallagher,881,4,851,"I was shocked when the sub-editor told me what he thought of my future. He was old and near retirement, smelt of extinguished cigarettes from the overflowing ash tray next to his typewriter. It was late 1983 and the newspaper office was about as dark and dim as the prospects he was predicting for my future.‚ÄòYou know,‚Äô he said to me, ‚Äòyou‚Äôll never make it as a journalist.‚ÄôIt came from nowhere, just before knockoff time on a Friday afternoon. I‚Äôd been working for free that week at the local newspaper in Sydney, Australia. I was barely 15 years-old, a Year 10 student at a Catholic School up the road in Castle Hill. My week at the paper was called ‚Äòwork experience‚Äô and it was meant to be a positive and rewarding ‚Äòexploration of vocation‚Äô. I‚Äôd already settled on a path of journalism for my adult life and hadn‚Äôt asked the ‚Äòsub‚Äô for his opinion.‚ÄòI just have to say it before you go,‚Äô he said, smiling.I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a harsh assessment, and just kept packing up my pens and notepad and zipped the blue backpack I‚Äôd stuck under the old timber desk. It wasn‚Äôt as if I was thinking too highly of myself, because the Editor ‚Äî his boss ‚Äî was happy with my work and had the opposite view.I didn‚Äôt answer and kept packing, trying to fight back tears from forming. I‚Äôd actually been working for three weeks ‚Äî one week each at different places ‚Äî to experience journalism. I‚Äôd had a great time and felt like this was really the right path for me.‚ÄòYou‚Äôre incredible,‚Äô one workmate had even said after looking at some copy I wrote one day. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got a gift!‚ÄôNow, right at the end of the combined ‚Äòwork experience‚Äô, I was being told the opposite.I went over to the Editor‚Äôs desk and thanked him for the week, then looked politely back at the Sub‚Äôs desk. He was still waiting for my reply.‚ÄòThank you,‚Äô I said, a little meekly, ‚Äòfor the week.‚Äô‚ÄòOkay,‚Äô he replied, surprised I didn‚Äôt have something more pointed in reply. I think he expected one of two responses ‚Äî either I would agree with him and say I was a bit of a failure already with journalism, or that I would fight him, challenging the assessment.I did neither and walked away, as quickly as I could without running.I‚Äôve never forgotten his words. Age 51 and it still hurts a little.It‚Äôs strange though, because I‚Äôve actually become a successful journalist, editor, writer and published author in the years since ‚Äî maybe not by his measure, but I really do have the book sales to prove it! If I‚Äôd been vindictive, I could have packaged a copy of a political biography I wrote and sent it to him back in 2006 just to rub it in. Of course, he‚Äôs probably passed away since, and in any case never thought again about me.But what he said stuck in some way, although not like a rudder for my life‚Äî more of an occasional tug on the sail.I even feel sometimes like I‚Äôm still in that dingy office hearing the words as a boy, and I want to grab that younger kid and hug him until the tears actually come out.So why the memory? Why do I go back there sometimes and think of those words.I think it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre all susceptible to it ‚Äî recalling the negative titles and predictions of past years. We drag them up out of nowhere, thinking those words still have some sort of power.They don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have power. They have resonance, and that‚Äôs a different thing.Those negative things people say about us in our past echo and reverberate through our lives, but only have the power we allow them to!What I did with those words was to recognise them as another‚Äôs ‚Äòquotes‚Äô, not the ‚Äòheadline‚Äô for my life.I had a different story to write and tell, and I wrote it myself; took the photos as well, and even narrated it‚Ä¶ Not with his voice, but mine!The thing that protected me that day in 1983 was something I said to Mum and Dad when I got home that night: Just a simple assessment but it helped me compartmentalise those incorrect words rather than let them fester in me.‚ÄòI think what I learnt from the Sub‚Äôs prediction today,‚Äô I said to my parents, ‚Äòwas that it said more about his disappointments in life than it does about my future.‚ÄôLooking back, it seems a weird thing for a 15 year-old to say, but it was absolutely true.He was wrong. But I didn‚Äôt need to spend my life proving him incorrect.Instead, I took that thought and let it echo rather than shout.I wasn‚Äôt able to mute him in my head, but I kept his volume low, and got on with my life.About Paul Gallagher: I‚Äôm a writer with origins in newspaper journalism and editing. My words are mostly about life, language, politics, faith, and Multiple Sclerosis (the latter unfortunately not by choice).

How to get Rich: What I learned from Rich Dad,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-get-rich-what-i-learned-from-rich-dad-c661f80cdb3,Joseph Brown,1400,12,2813,"If you want to be rich, then you need to master the knowledge, attitude and habits of the rich. Here‚Äôs what I learned from Rich Dad Robert Kiyosaki.I used to think that the biggest problem with the world was that the rich got richer and the poor stayed poor. However, I‚Äôm starting to learn that the difference between being rich and poor comes down to a couple of key things. Those things are knowledge and attitude.With the right knowledge and attitude it‚Äôs possible to go from poor to extremely wealthy.But it takes education. The kind of education we don‚Äôt teach kids in school.The need for financial education sparked my desire to learn these lessons and to teach others.Here‚Äôs what I learned from reading Robert Kiyosaki‚Äôs Rich Dad Poor Dad.Kiyosaki‚Äôs big lesson is that the middle class and working class, in general, don‚Äôt understand money. Money, for them, is tied up with great feelings of fear and desire. They are controlled by these fears and desires.The rich are rich because they master money.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self inflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 45)It‚Äôs fear and desire that leads the poor to tell themselves stories. Stories like ‚Äòeveryone needs to work‚Äô, ‚Äòonly the lucky get rich‚Äô, ‚Äòthe system is rigged‚Äô, ‚Äòthe rich are crooks‚Äô and so on.The rich control their feelings about money. Control means they don‚Äôt react to feelings and they think. They think long term about what things mean and what they want.This led me to start really thinking.My story had always been the poor story ‚Äî ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt afford it‚Äô, ‚Äòeveryone needs to work‚Äô, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not one of the special ones‚Äô and so on. I thought this way because I was scared.I was scared I needed a job to survive. There was fear that I wasn‚Äôt good enough so I had to do well to keep my job. Then these feeling of fear were compensated by splurging on desires when I did have money. And so I was trapped in the cycle of fear and desire related to money.But then I stopped.I started to think about these fears and desires instead of just acting on them. By stopping and thinking, I was able to see what I really desired and see what the real fear was.Now my fears and desires work for me. Now I‚Äôm afraid of being stuck in a job till the day I die. I desire financial freedom and the power to help my family and be able to help those who are suffering.Now, instead of asking how do I save my job, I ask how do I escape working a job and how do I get everything I want?Instead of operating out of fear and desire, I question where I am and how I go from one level to the next to my long term goal of being rich and the master of money.In short, and as I‚Äôve already written about, the rich don‚Äôt work for money ‚Äî they invest and make money work for them ‚Äî this is only possible when you overcome fear and desire.Once you overcome fear and desire you are able to start learning and attaining the knowledge of how to make money.They save their money and invest it. This is only possible when you have overcome fear and you have become knowledgeable about investment.(For more on this topic, see my previous articles, How to Achieve Financial Freedom Through Investing.)The other thing they do, is build businesses and make others work for them. This takes a whole lot of knowledge and a whole lot of courage. This is what I am contemplating now. This means becoming much better than I am now and overcoming huge fears. But I am committed to getting my goals and I will overcome.If we want to become rich we need to know how to make money. We need to understand financial literacy.We live in a time of great change and there are plenty of examples of easy come and easy go. To be truly rich we need to know how to make money and more importantly how to make money in a risky world. Beyond that we need to know how to keep it.‚ÄúIf people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 56)Financial literacy is a must. Accounting is essential, so we build our wealth on sound foundations. We need to keep track of the money and assets we have working for us. Otherwise, it‚Äôs easy to lose track and end up losing it.The first and most important rule of financial literacy is to know the difference between assets and liabilities. When you know the difference, then buy assets.Assets are the things that make money. So buy assets that make money and you will get rich. Things like stocks, bonds, businesses and real estate.However, don‚Äôt confuse assets and liabilities. The main confusion the poor have is that they see the family home as an asset. They see the family car as an asset. But these things don‚Äôt make money. They cost us money.The rich buy assets. They track their assets and those assets make them money. The poor buy liabilities, like the family car and the family home, which they think are assets. However, those liabilities end up taking more of their money, not growing them money.Know what an asset is, keep track of your assets and account for your wealth.You need to track the money. The rich make sure their wealth is always growing in real terms, after taxes and depreciation and so on. The poor value their assets in things they have and don‚Äôt account for the money those things are chewing up.The only way to know these things is financial literacy. This is something we should teach a whole lot more. A more educated population that can avoid the traps of debt and inefficient asset allocation, is a population in a much better position to promote real economic growth and prosperity. Unfortunately, this is not on the curriculum for the majority of the population.‚ÄúFinancial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their working days.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 86)Don‚Äôt confuse your profession with your business. I‚Äôm a teacher, but that‚Äôs not my business. Not yet. People forget to mind their own business ‚Äî they mind someone else‚Äôs. Your business is in your asset column.When people rely on their job, they are vulnerable. Take me, I am currently working, as a teacher, on a 2 year contract. If that‚Äôs all I have, then I am a slave. However, now I have investments and a plan, if I get ‚Äúdownsized‚Äù I‚Äôm not going to be so worried.Mind your business means knowing your situation. It also means knowing how the bank evaluates your situation; what your liability in taxes are, being aware of your assets, liabilities, strengths and weaknesses.Most people just don‚Äôt know. They get a check from their employer and the bank says great and they can buy what they want. From there on out they are stuck minding their boss‚Äôs business, praying they don‚Äôt ever lose it and hoping for a raise.Build your business.Build your assets column with a list of assets that make you money when you don‚Äôt need to work. Such as stocks, real estate, and a business that you own but don‚Äôt need to run.This won‚Äôt be easy. This takes some building to set up and a lot of hard work. But it is how you get rich.Set up this business and you‚Äôll be on your way to financial freedom and true wealth.Love them or hate them, and I don‚Äôt hate them as much as Mr Kiyosaki, taxes are a huge expense on individuals. Now, I actually believe it is our responsibility to pay taxes and I see the need for the government to provide infrastructure and other social needs.However, to avoid being overly taxed and double taxed, on the income created by entrepreneurial endeavors, the rich use the power of the corporation to protect their wealth.‚ÄúIt is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 98)This was a huge lesson I learned from the Rich dad. Setting up a corporation protects your earnings and has lots of other perks.Understanding the law and the power of corporations is a huge advantage that the rich have. By wrapping their investments in a corporation they provide protection for them from lawsuits and provide loopholes that can reduce taxes on earnings.I‚Äôm not an expert and this is an area that I‚Äôm willing to say I need education and most likely I will need to rely on outside assistance. However, the very basic accounting behind the corporation is the ability for the owner to spend pretax dollars.As an employee, you get paid a salary, which is taxed immediately and then you may be able to claim some back after you‚Äôve done spending the rest. However, as the owner, you collect the money then you have a huge range of options on how you can spend the money before it gets taxed.If you know the tax code, then there is a huge number of advantageous and enjoyable ways to spend those pretax dollars. Once you‚Äôve spent those dollars, you are taxed on what‚Äôs left, which is a lot less than being taxed on what you started with.Again, I‚Äôm no expert, but the basic take away for me is there are huge advantages to owning a corporation.If the money I make investing and from other ventures goes into the corporation, then I can claim a whole range of business deductions that I can use to further advance my business. Once those deductions are paid for, I then pay a smaller amount of tax on what is left.I‚Äôm not against taxes, but when I‚Äôm taking a huge risk to try and go alone and even to build something that will employ others and have a positive influence on the economy, it seems fair that there are some incentives. Also, working double time, only to see half of the year spent on paying taxes, seems unreasonable.Entrepreneurs literally invent industries that generate money. Rich dad gives the examples of Alexander Graham Bell and Bill Gates. Before these two, there was no market for telephones or personal computers. After them there were billion dollar industries that generated huge profits.It is the same with investing. By owning assets, protected correctly by corporations and the knowledge of the laws, money is invented without ever having to work or save.Like with our own investments. Our shares produced dividends this month. Money went straight from our asset column into our income column without any thought, effort, hard work, sweat or tears: Money was simply invented.Develop your financial IQ and be the type who invents money and not the type who collects money.Kiyosaki explains why he builds his financial IQ:‚ÄúI do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I‚Äôd rather be welcoming change than dreading it. I‚Äôd rather be excited about making millions than worrying about not getting a raise.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 111.)For me:When I started to think like this, it became empowering. I used to live in fear that I wouldn‚Äôt have enough to retire on. I was afraid that younger teachers would be better educated and one day I‚Äôd struggle to get a job. Also, I sometimes worried if I lost my job I‚Äôd be in real trouble.However, now I feel like I‚Äôm always building skills that make me stronger than the rest. I feel like everyday I see another opportunity to invent more money. And I feel like I‚Äôm on track to have a bright positive future. I run towards this vision much more than I ever ran away from the fear.So now as I contemplate the initial stages of my entrepreneurial journey, I feel confident as an investor. Now that I‚Äôve learned some of the language of investing and I have some IQ, I‚Äôm positive that we will make a fortune, which is much better than at the beginning when we feared every little dangerous step.Going forward I need to learn more about corporations and build my business IQ, so that I can be positive about finally making that switch from employee to business owner with confidence and capability.What we all should know: * Financial literacy. The ability to read and judge numbers. * Investment strategies. The science of making money. * The market. Supply and demand. * The Law. Accounting, corporate, state and national rules.(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 120.)‚Äú‚Ä¶ most people need only learn and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially‚Ä¶ When it comes to money, the only skill most people know is to work hard.‚Äù(Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Page 133)The writer wants to write a best-selling novel. His advice to her is to take a course in sales. To this she responds with anger and considers it a ‚Äòsell-out‚Äô. However, he makes a very good observation, that he is not a great writer, but he is a best-selling author because he knows how to sell.This example makes it very clear. The author wants to be a best selling author and make lots of money out of the skill she is very good at. However, she doesn‚Äôt want to learn the skill that is needed to be able to achieve the sales she wants.Kiyosaki‚Äôs advice is that she leave her job, find a new one, even one that pays less, so she can learn the skills she needs to be able to make her passion more productive.This I now consider as great advice.I see plenty of teachers around me. They are among the smartest and most well educated people around. However, they don‚Äôt earn half as much as people with half the education. The truth is, they have lots of education and know a lot of really valuable information, but they have no training in how to use those skills to make money.Seeing this, I think I‚Äôm going to use my time to learn the skills I need to go to the next level. So while I‚Äôm not going to quit my job just yet, I‚Äôm here studying and learning about financial IQ, about sales, and blogging, and marketing, and business structures and so on, so I can put my intelligence to work. So I can spend more of my time doing what I love. Such as writing that best selling novel, to go traveling, and one day to contribute to helping those in need.The sad truth is, if you are just working for a pay check, you are signing off on your time. Your time should be spent working towards getting free. You can only get free and live the way you want when you have access to the skills to make money your slave.Here we come to the end of our brief overview of how to achieve success with the rich dad, Robert Kiyosaki. This is by no means the only lessons in his extremely helpful book. I strongly recommend you look him up on Youtube here and go out and purchase a copy of his book for yourself. He has so much more to offer and I believe this book was an incredibly valuable investment for myself.The main take away message I got from Rich Dad Poor Dad, was that we have a choice. We can chose to take control, learn the skills we need, overcome fear, take responsibility and take charge of our destiny.This approach and this attitude is what leads people to become rich. The other choice is to take the easy path and give over your agency and work for someone else who has all the power over you and your destiny.For me the choice is easy. The actual execution is not easy. It‚Äôs a step by step process dealing with many lessons and confronting lots of fear. But at the end of the day, I feel more empowered and I feel inspired that I will be in charge of my life and I am writing my own destiny and becoming more than I have ever been.The choice is yours. Float through life hoping for the best, of get real and start working towards living life with energy and living life on your terms.Thanks again for allowing me to share these thoughts.

‚ÄúBuild it and They Will Come‚Äù ‚Äî Why This is the Worst Advice in Business,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/build-it-and-they-will-come-why-this-is-the-worst-advice-in-business-8df34467e370,Samuel James White,890,6,1256,"The phrase ‚ÄúBuild it and they will come.‚Äù has been making the rounds for a long time. Many new entrepreneurs will hear this soon after they begin.To put it simply, this is the worst advice in business and anyone who says otherwise should be instantly ignored.It‚Äôs a piece of advice that was relevant to yesteryear. Once upon a time, you could build it and people would come. Your business would gain popularity through word of mouth. But those times have changed.With globalisation and the Internet, it has no place in 2019 because people won‚Äôt come when you build it. And even if by some miracle they discover you and do come it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to stay or give you any money.The Average Consumer has Too Many OptionsBack in the day, you could live in a small town and open up a store. You‚Äôd get customers because people would naturally come across it. And the chances are you were one of only a few games in town anyway.Those days are long gone because the average consumer has hundreds of thousands of alternatives. Their boundaries have extended beyond their towns and cities. They can now choose to buy something from a company in India, France, China, Australia, or anywhere else you can think of.Geographical boundaries are dead, and with that you can‚Äôt rely on building something and assuming customers are going to flood in.This applies to every type of business and service you can think of.Why should they choose your business over every other option available to them?That‚Äôs the question you have to answer.Once upon a time, if you opened up a bicycle repair shop in a small town in the Midwest, you were likely the only shop offering that service in town. People had no choice but to choose you as their repair shop of choice.Now you‚Äôre competing with everyone from small businesses to corporations. And if they want to buy a new bike they can just click onto the myriad of outlets online.When you launch a new business venture in 2019, nobody cares. Your first goal is to make them care, and opening up your doors just isn‚Äôt going to cut it anymore.The Competition has IntensifiedWestern shopping outlets are struggling. Malls and shopping zones have to get creative to get people to visit. The presence of shops alone isn‚Äôt going to get people to leave their homes on a Saturday afternoon.That‚Äôs why the average mall now has to have things like food courts, cinemas, and arcades. These have become more critical than ever before. They‚Äôre not just a way for the mall to create an extra stream of income, like in the old days. They‚Äôre now the selling point because when you can shop online why would you drive all the way to the mall to be surrounded by people you don‚Äôt care for?Physical stores now have to convince people to take time out of their days, drive to a crowded place, be around people they don‚Äôt like, to find an item that may or may not be in stock, and then stand in line to buy that item.On the other hand, you could order the item from Amazon in two minutes and guarantee it will be on your doorstep the next day.When you‚Äôre competing with all this, setting up a business is like being in the bathroom. Nobody is going to know about you. As time passes, still, nobody is going to know about you if you just expect people to discover you.Nobody Cares About Your BusinessIt might be hard to hear this because for many entrepreneurs their business is like a child to them. They‚Äôre passionate about it. They love it.But nobody cares. You haven‚Äôt given them a reason to care.I still see people putting classified ads in newspapers and on their websites about their grand business opening. That‚Äôs fine, but I don‚Äôt see mentions of major grand opening discounts. So why would anyone show up?So you‚Äôre launching your business for the first time‚Ä¶so what?The same can be applied to any online business.I see businesses celebrating their anniversaries or hitting another major milestone. Yet I see nothing on the table for the consumer. So why would people come to you just because you built something?We‚Äôre all in it for ourselves. As a customer, I don‚Äôt care about your brand. I just want the product I want for the best price. I couldn‚Äôt care less about your one-year anniversary and your stupid party bunting.Let‚Äôs use building a platform on a site like Medium as an example.How many hundreds of thousands of writers are there on this website? How many millions of readers are here inside and outside the paywall? You think just because you write a piece of content that someone is going to go read it?Unless you have an enormously original idea and it gets featured, nobody is going to find you if you just write, publish, and sit back.As a reader, I don‚Äôt care how many hours you spent on a certain article. They weren‚Äôt my hours. I‚Äôm not going to read out of charity.You need to give me something of value or I‚Äôm going to keep my five minutes.Just Because they Come Doesn‚Äôt Mean They‚Äôll StayThis is another major problem newer businesses have. Entrepreneurs tend to see things through rose-tinted spectacles. They think their business is wonderful. It‚Äôs fantastic. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to spend their money here?But you have to look at it from the perspective of the customer.What do they want out of this?They don‚Äôt care about the name above the door or your wonderful colour scheme on your website. It doesn‚Äôt matter to them that your copy is amazing. They have a problem. They want that problem solved.A business constantly has to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat is the customer looking for?‚ÄùFirst-time entrepreneurs tend to feel great when they get their first customers. But a year later they haven‚Äôt evolved and then they‚Äôre left wondering why their income is down.Sure, you might live in a small town and you might have lured some people into your online or offline store. But unless they actually spent some money or they otherwise engaged with your business in a manner that may lead to a sale, they may as well have not come at all.Their value to you remains a big fat zero.What Can You Do to Make Your Business Successful?Forget about ‚ÄúBuild it and they will come.‚Äù You‚Äôre not that important and nobody cares. We‚Äôve established that.What you have to do is build, keep building, and then tell people over and over that what your building is relevant to them.It‚Äôs not as sexy of a business quote, but that‚Äôs really what it‚Äôs all about.Entrepreneurs need to be:1. Providing a business that solves the problem of their target market.2. Offering a unique selling point that trumps their competition.3. Actively going out and telling people that they exist in the first place.These are the principles that apply to any type of business anywhere in the world. Of course, saying it is easy but executing it is another matter entirely.You must know your target market as well as you know your own family members. It‚Äôs not about this backward thinking of telling customers why they need this or that. They know what they need. They just need someone to give it to them in a way that they‚Äôve never been given it before.Do all that and then you have the formula of a successful business.What other pieces of terrible business advice have you received?",18/07/2019,1,0,6,1,1050,699,3,0,0,6,112
Please Stop Believing,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/please-stop-believing-cab390535747,Judith Heaney,117,4,763,"Often God will ask me to write something not because I will touch someone else‚Äôs heart but so that He may touch mine. And while I believe that, and know it‚Äôs true, this showing up daily requires much of me most of the time.Want to know why? Lean in a bit, and I‚Äôll whisper my confession to you.Confession: the word, writer, scares me.Okay, maybe not the word itself as much as its implications when applied to me. Like at the top of my Facebook page and the new and improved website I launched along with my new book, where it says, ‚ÄúJudith Heaney, writer.‚Äù I am a writer, one who writes and shares words with the world. That‚Äôs scary stuff for sure.Perhaps the bigger secret, my bigger fear, is when I fall off the writing wagon, that tag of, writer, attached to my name makes me feel like a fraud, an imposter, someone pretending to be a writer.But here‚Äôs the thing, friends. Not writing for any length of time (a day, a week, or several months) doesn‚Äôt mean I am no longer a writer. Rather, I am a writer who took a break to tend to other aspects of life. Even writers have seasons, and sometimes the season we find ourselves in as writers is one of quiet and reflection and breathing.There‚Äôs no shame in being a writer who isn‚Äôt writing. Even so, we feel ashamed. We feel guilty. We feel like we are playing at something and have no right to call ourselves a writer. That‚Äôs what my idea of creativity tells me: I must be creating something tangible and obvious, something others can see, hear, touch.But what about when I‚Äôm not doing that? What about when creating looks differently than what I think it‚Äôs supposed to be?When creative people (and we are all creative people) stop creating, we shrug out of the title like a too small jacket. We believe the word describes us only when we are actively creating, in my case, when I‚Äôm writing.But creating has many forms and can involve small moments of quiet reflection, collecting ideas, journaling, researching a topic, putting together a weekly or monthly meal plan, crafting a letter to a friend, making plans with your spouse over coffee. It can include myriad actions, big or small.Perhaps if we pried open the narrowly defined idea of creativity we have, we might see the act of being creative encompasses much more than we‚Äôve always believed it does. In other words, please, stop believing creativity is a narrowly defined idea intended to look only a few certain ways.I am a writer. I am a writer even when I‚Äôm not writing as much or as often as I want to. I am a writer when I watch a movie from a writing perspective. I am a writer when I jot ideas in a notebook. I am a writer when I read. I am a writer when I read to my girls. I am a writer when I ask a friend about a favorite story.I am a writer. I am a writer because I am a creative soul and writing remains in me even when the words, ideas, and stories have yet to be poured out onto the page.And you, my friends, are equally creative souls because each of us is created to create. I will repeat these words often because I believe deeply and simply creativity is the something more for which so many of us yearn.Each of us is created to pour forth beauty into this world. We are created to forge relationships and to offer encouragement and to do good works and to change the world. Yes, each of us has the opportunity and potential to change our small corner of the world.Creativity provides that to each of us because creativity builds community through relationships and beauty, through art and writing, through meals and conversations, through memories and moments. Please, stop believing creativity is meant only for a select group of people.Creativity transforms ordinary moments into sacred ones, and it‚Äôs a part of each of us.Even so, creating will almost always brings with it a sense of doubt. But within the act of creating there are whispers of deep truths that yearn to be told. And not only told, but heard, shared, uncovered, and set free to change the world. Through me. Through you.If you stop by my page occasionally and listen carefully, you just may hear those whispers. I hope you‚Äôll take them to heart and believe them about yourself.I‚Äôll see you back here tomorrow.",18/07/2019,0,0,2,6,723,449,3,0,0,6,100

The Question You Should ask Yourself If you Want to Know if you are Managing Your Time the Right Way,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-question-you-should-ask-yourself-if-you-want-to-know-if-you-are-managing-your-time-the-right-6575b3510508,Claudia Vidor,344,6,1134,"For years I had been focusing on ticking things off the list; I didn‚Äôt give much thought on if I was enjoying the journey, or if I was fulfilling my life purpose.To give you an example, before becoming a mum, I would wake up at around 6 am, exercise, get ready for work, work all day, go back home, have dinner (home or out), spend some time reading or watching TV, and go to sleep. Something was nagging at me, but I didn‚Äôt know what it was.Then I became a mother and life changed dramatically; fewer dinner out, fewer restful nights, lots of breastfeeding and cuddling moments. But I was still somewhat ticking things off an imaginary list that I had created; take my baby to an ‚Äúexercise‚Äù class, clean the bathroom, cook the muffins, write an article.And, by the end of the day, as a mother or a non-mother, I would end up feeling utterly exhausted, and somewhat spent.Until someone asked me a question that revolutionise my whole way of thinking:‚ÄúAre you managing your time, or are you managing your energy? How much energy do you have at the end of the day?‚ÄùWhat do you mean? I asked. Isn‚Äôt it normal to feel completed deflated by 8 pm?Apparently not.This is when I got in touch with the theory of energy management, instead of time management.Everyone talks about managing the time, although Einstein had taught us in 1915 that time is relative. Some moments last forever (the queue at the shops while you are holding a crying bub), and some that go too quickly (watching your little angel sleeping soundly, tucked in under a warm blanket).Although we know that time is relative, we still want to control it, and for some reason, we always feel that we don‚Äôt have enough time, or that we are running out of time.On the contrary, we have plenty of time, as soon as we tune in with our body and our energy, and as soon as we modify our expectations.A woman has 4 cyclical phases that repeat themselves every month: the follicular phase, the ovulation, the luteal phase, and the menstruation. During those stages of life our bodies, hormones, energy levels change dramatically. Yet, every day of our life, we dismiss our feminine body and we power through as if we were men, demanding our body to achieve tasks there are not meant to do.Do you resonate with that?Moving from time management to an energy management perspective have overall changed my life, but has in particular:‚Ä¢ Lowered my stress level‚Ä¢ Reduce injuries and bodily pain‚Ä¢ Improved my sleep quality‚Ä¢ Assisted my digestion and absorption of food‚Ä¢ It allowed me to enjoy the present moment with my family.How did I do that?I started by paying attention to my menstrual cycleWhy would I ask my crampy, pain-ridden body to go to a HIIT class on the first day of my period? And at the same time, why would I isolate myself and do all the kitchen work (editing, website changing) while I was in my follicular phase, brimming with ideas and creativity? As soon as I got in sync with my cycle, I noticed that life became much easier than expected. All of a sudden it was fine to rest when tired, and to pull an all-nighter when filled with energy.I identified the leakIf you are feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by the end of the day (or even the beginning of it), there is a leak where all your energy falls through; my biggest leak was skipping breakfast, having 3 coffees a day, and thinking I was in charge of parenting my child. When I started introducing a nourishing breakfast, I cut down my coffee intake to one a day, and as soon as I realised that my husband had the same amount of responsibilities I had when it came down to raise our child, I felt that my leak was fixed.Before it felt as if I was trying to pour water into a broken bucket: pointless and exhausting. After sharing the load and nurturing my body, the bucket fixed itself.I became gentle toward my bodyForcing myself to do something I didn‚Äôt have the energy to do, made me feel miserable. I didn‚Äôt realise it straight away, but when I would focus my time doing things that bored the hell out of me or that I really didn‚Äôt want to do (ex: going to an event dinner when I craved the comfort of my family), I would always end up frustrated, anxious and sad.That‚Äôs when I introduced gentleness into my routine.Some days I feel like a rock star, other times I just want to stay in the house and away from society. You can do that, and no apologies are needed. A pretty revolutionary concept, right?I value my strength instead of punishing my weaknessesI‚Äôm fully awake and creative in the morning, and quite useless at night; when I stopped looking at it as a weakness, but as a strength, life unfolded. I now know it is important for me to focus on creative, urgent or demanding tasks in the morning, while I can do all the editing and the email answering at night when my brain is on energy-saving mode.I also know that family time recharges me, and I will never be that businesswoman that works 80 hours a week and achieve a million-dollar revenue in less than 6 months; I‚Äôm fully aware and fully ok with it, and I feel in balance as long as I align myself with my values.I allow flexibilityPacking my calendar to the brim has always led to the same problem: crippling anxiety, digestive issues, pain, and poor sleep filled with vivid nightmares.As soon as I started focusing on what is important, instead of losing my energy in completing menial tasks (for me it was tidying up the house every time my baby went down for a nap), my productivity has increased exponentially. I have realised that I don‚Äôt have to do it all, I can outsource, ask for help, and say no.At the same time, I also started accepting that ‚Äúsurprises happen‚Äù; my child gets sick, my husband comes home late from work, or I have to deal with a crippling flare-up.I now allow myself time for ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù (unpleasant or not); for days when I feel glittery and I just want to work, meet people, and enjoy life, and for days when the only thing I can do is staying home with a sick bubba that just wants to be held.Having flexibility in my weekly schedule, allow me to have flexibility in my life, and I don‚Äôt feel anxious anymore when I don‚Äôt feel as productive as I would, as there will be time for that, as soon as things go back to normal.",19/07/2019,3,0,6,2,1050,699,3,0,0,0,84
The Ultimate Guide To Living A Stylish Life Without Overspending,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-ultimate-guide-to-financing-a-stylish-life-without-overspending-d3f5bf448a63,Isaac Breese,1000,6,1085,"How much thought is devoted to your purchase decisions? No, seriously do the items you buy mean anything to you or are they just another intoxicating piece of money poorly spent?More times than not, many of you spend little to no thought on what you buy in stores or online. And when you do make a conscious decision as to what you should buy, generally, the deciding factor always seems to be which one looks best instead of which one fits you best.Many of the items you own mean nothing to you. Half of the clothes hanging, in your closet hold no significance. In fact, it‚Äôs for this very reason some of them still have tags them.Does this sound like you?If I had to guess, I doubt an accumulation of things is a cool way to impress people with how much disposable income you have. So why do it? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to buy a select number of things that hold a lifetime of value versus a ton of nonsense that hold no importance at all?I can sense you nodding your heads in agreement. Fortunately for you adding more value isn‚Äôt as hard as you think.Believe it or not the lifestyle items you buy say more about you than you think they do.They represent your identity: they symbolize who you are and where you come from. They communicate something about you that isn‚Äôt being said. So why purchase something that communicates anything less than what you want it to?Most of us make our purchase decisions based on price, looks, convenience or a combination of the three. And because everyone else buys their for the the exact same reasons we start to look like everyone else.But you don‚Äôt want to look like everyone else do you? You like to think you‚Äôre incredibly different. You‚Äôre unique. Right? Well if you believe this, make sure you‚Äôre clothes says this about you. Make sure you‚Äôre car says this about you. Make sure everything you own says exactly what you want them to say about you.‚ÄúBut how?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs all up to you. If you believe a couch goes as deep as your origins buy it. If you think that jacket is a manifestation of your values and beliefs don‚Äôt hesitate to unleash your card at the register.There should be a story behind almost everything. There should‚Äôve something in you‚Äôre wardrobe, garage or house that coincides with who you are. When you purchase your next item ask yourself how it represents you. Figure out how that item matches your unique qualities, origins, values and beliefs.Think about your favorite possession. What makes it you‚Äôre favorite? Is it‚Äôs solely based looks or do you share a striking emotional connection with that particular thing more than anything else you own?Probably the latter. Our favorite pieces, without a doubt, can be tied to an emotional connection with a time, place, event or person.My personal prized possession hangs on the baseboard of my bed. It‚Äôs a leather jacket I brought while in Florence, Italy during my amazing study abroad trip. It‚Äôs an a badass black Italian leather bomber stunningly lined with shearling. It‚Äôs hands down my favorite jacket if not favorite piece of clothing.Yet what makes it my favorite isn‚Äôt the fact that it‚Äôs Italian leather or that it has shearling lining or that it was made in Italy. What makes it my favorite is that it reminds me of the time I spent in Italy and the people I spent that time with.That jacket reminds me of all the places I had gone while studying abroad. It reminds me of the breathtaking experience I had in Italy in the most fashionable way possible. I share a connection with that jacket unlike any other.When making a purchase, don‚Äôt simply buy an item because you like how it looks, take into consideration how it makes you feel. Take into account how it connects with you.Maybe it brings you happiness. Maybe it brings you back to a time and a place in which you blissfully enjoyed or maybe it reminds you of the people you care about.Next time you make a purchase don‚Äôt base it off looks go off an emotional connection. Decide with your heart.We undoubtedly could never go back in time, but wouldn‚Äôt it be just as good to bring the old days with us?One of the greatest feelings in the wold is the feeling of nostalgia. We are constantly reflecting on past days when things were simple and filled with a bit more happiness. We hold onto the days of the past through memorabilia and souvenirs to remind us of the glorious times we had way back when.Sometimes we‚Äôll even wear things that give us this nostalgic feeling. In some cases we‚Äôll wear things from a time period where we didn‚Äôt exist to help us fantasize about what it would have been like to live in that era.Why? Because what we want more deeply than anything else is to live out our dreams. What we want is to explore the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and the ‚ÄúI wonders‚Äù.What better way to get that than owning vintage furniture from a time and place we aspire to be? What better way to get that feeling of nostalgia than to put a 1959 Cadillac De Ville in your garage to help transports you back to the past?Sometime in the near future you will go out shopping and you will browse the stores like everyone else. You may even decide to stay at home and browse the online stores of various brands.Like everyone else you will decide if certain items look good or don‚Äôt. Like everyone else you will decide if you can wear those items with anything else at home.However, I charge you to bravely take it a step further. I charge you to examine how that article of clothing, how that piece of furniture or how that vehicle helps to define you. To be mindful of how that item aligns with your story, your origins, your values and beliefs.I empower you to find ways in which you will share an emotional connection with what you pull off the rack or add to your cart. I challenge you to buy with your heart.I beg that your next purchase provides a feeling of nostalgia. I ask that what you wear arouses a glimpse of the past and provides some semblance of an answer to the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wonders‚Äù.I charge you to put meaning into what you buy.Thanks for reading.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,1,1050,700,4,0,0,8,52
Fall Asleep Super Fast,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/fall-asleep-super-fast-e424a4bd84fd,Danny Oak,269,5,959,"You know those kinds of things that people do so naturally that they think anybody can do it as easy or as good as them?Like, imagine amazing outfits with only a 3-seconds-glance throughout any closet (can a glance be 3 seconds long??).Or splitting that $359,79 dinner bill (plus 15% tip) by 5 friends in 4 seconds.Or scheduling the day so optimally that they can fit there their two jobs, the yoga class, the kids‚Äô practices, a couple of errands, making dinner, read a book and still have time to drink a bottle of wine with their partner.BTW, I am not any of these persons, but I kick ass at one very important skill.My superpower is to fall asleep!That‚Äôs right, I can fall asleep in seconds and almost anywhere, and believe me when I say it is a great skill to have, but I never thought I was any special until I started to notice that most of my friends and acquaintances struggle to fall asleep!It is no news that sleep is extremely important for our well being.Having enough (and good) sleep is a major factor in the success (or lack of it) in any area of our lives.And especially for our health, it is vital. You can check this book and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be amazed by many of its insights.I do not sleep as long as I should or wanted to, because I‚Äôm not very good scheduling my day (I‚Äôm a one-superpower-only kind of guy) so I tend to have a lot of stuff to do late at night, but I fall asleep in a remarkably easy and fast way.Although I knew this characteristic was very positive, I never thought much about it, until I came across this article from Sharon Ackman:medium.comI have never heard of this ‚Äúmilitary trick‚Äù before, so I found it very interesting and it helped me to understand my process a little better, although I don‚Äôt follow the whole sleeping routine explained in the article, because I simply don‚Äôt need it.The one thing I could really relate with was this:The last step is to clear your mind for 10 seconds. That‚Äôs it. No thinking about what went wrong that day, or what time you need to get up, or when you‚Äôll get to call your partner.(‚Ä¶)Instead, you need to keep your mind still. You can do this by holding a static image in your head.Sharon Ackman ‚Äî How to Fall Asleep in 120 Seconds ‚Äî MediumThis is precisely what I do ever since I can remember. The minute I lay in bed to sleep, I close my eyes and instantly comes up a smooth grey ‚Äúwall‚Äù that I focus on and, for my girlfriend‚Äôs despair, 15 seconds later I‚Äôm snoring like a drunk bear.Only when I read Ackman‚Äôs article I understood that this visualization is part of a ‚Äúsleeping routine‚Äù, which means that it can actually help some people that struggle for falling asleep, otherwise, this wouldn‚Äôt be taught in the army.I find it hard to explain my own version of this technique, but I‚Äôll give it a shot.When it‚Äôs time to go to sleep I lay in bed with my belly down and I close my eyes and I kinda look towards my forehead (with my eyes shut) and I visualize a grey square similar to this:This grey square comes with silence and void, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a room protected from any distraction, although I can only see one of the walls.I do this with absolutely no effort, it just pops up and all my attention is on that image. I don‚Äôt listen to any sound, I don‚Äôt care about any of my problems (and believe me, I have my fair share of them), I don‚Äôt think about what I have to do the next day, I simply ‚Äúlook‚Äù at that grey square that is standing 2 inches from my forehead and in less than a minute I‚Äôm sleeping.I can‚Äôt tell you why I do it, or how I do it, I just do it.I don‚Äôt need to intentionally relax my body or tell my limbs to go to sleep. I‚Äôm a lazy person, so my body always want to rest, so I guess I‚Äôm lucky?The fact that I don‚Äôt sleep as many hours as I should also contribute to my body feeling tired at the end of the day, so it‚Äôs easier to rest.On the other hand, from my experience, it‚Äôs the mind that controls the body, so it is my mind that I need to tame, and again, lucky for me, my mind doesn‚Äôt give me much work on this issue.If only my mind was so easy to put to work as it is to put to sleep, I would be a world-renown creative machine.I‚Äôm not sure if this can really help anyone, because like I said, I put zero effort on this and it comes naturally to me.It‚Äôs like asking Chris Hemsworth for dating advice. The guy just needs to breath to get a date, while the non-Nordic-gods like us need to put a little more work on it, so we must take advice from ‚Äúnatural-born (fill the blanc)‚Äù with a pinch of salt.Anyway, if you struggle to fall asleep I think you should try this or even the whole ‚Äúmilitary-tested trick‚Äù mentioned in the article above. It may cost you a little in the beginning, but who knows, it might work and improve a really important aspect of your life.If it doesn‚Äôt work, you won‚Äôt get worst, so you don‚Äôt take any risk of losing anything, so go for it, pull out that grey square from your mind and use it as a filter for any sleeping distraction.I hope it works, sweet dreams!*Mentioned book is an affiliate link.",19/07/2019,0,0,2,7,812,621,5,0,0,9,127
The Best Part of Being a Writer Isn‚Äôt Actually the Writing,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-best-part-of-being-a-writer-isnt-actually-the-writing-5c45c9f6ceb,Rachel Hardy,1800,3,583,"From the moment I could pick up a pencil and stick that tip to paper and form words, I‚Äôve been a writer.My mother and grandmother have bins full of notebooks detailing my early writings. I still find them scattered around the house from time to time.I smile at the simple plotlines. The misspelled words. The childlike wonder.There is something undeniably magical about writing even when we are quite young.Writing gives us the power to shape and make worlds. At the same time, with a simple brush stroke of a pen, we can unmake them.Words give us abilities and powers unheard of in the natural world, and they also allow us to explore far flung reaches of the planet and see with our mind‚Äôs eye the things that we could never see otherwise.Words have the power to change minds and shape hearts and lives.For this reason, I have always and forever will be infatuated with the written world.But there is something even more amazing about writing and that is its ability to create conversation, to bring people together, to inspire and to share.My favorite part about writing on Medium is the conversations that spark between writers and readers. I love the insightful comments. I love the debates. I love the back and forth, the push and pull.I love seeing that my words have reached others. I love to know that they have touched hearts.When I open Medium to see a response waiting for me, I can hardly wait to read it.I‚Äôve had critical responses. I‚Äôve had readers point out grammatical errors. I‚Äôve had negative and positives responses, but I love them both. I love to see a response, regardless.My heart sores to infinite heights when I see another writer or reader praising what I have written. Of course, I love to see the compliments. I‚Äôve flagged some of the emails in my inbox so that I can go back and read these comments whenever I am feeling down or doubting my abilities as a writer.These comments help to affirm that I am on the right path. They are a little nudge from the universe. The world giving me a high five.Keep up the good work.But the critical and negative responses, though infinitely harder to read and swallow, are important to me still. They remind me to open my eyes and my heart. They remind me that I am not infallible and that I do still have a lot of growing to do, as a writer, yes, but also as a person.These responses get me thinking critically about my world view and my writing. They get me thinking about what is really important to me and about what kind of person I want to be known as.I love hearing people‚Äôs stories as well. When readers share that they have felt a similar way or experienced something similar, I‚Äôm grateful that my words left them feeling comfortable enough to share and to be vulnerable.Because that‚Äôs hard.It‚Äôs hard to bare your soul on the internet. It‚Äôs hard to tell a stranger about your pain or your struggles. It means a lot to me when readers respond to share their thoughts and triumphs and defeats.I love the bridges that the written word builds.I love the connection that it fosters.I love the conservation.So you see, my favorite part of writing may not even be the actual part where I sit at the table and write.My favorite part of writing is you, the reader, and everything you share with me.",18/07/2019,1,0,0,3,1050,880,1,0,0,0,116

SOLID heuristics,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/solid-heuristics-f7094237cf3,Warrenn Enslin,8,3,587,"Oh no not more ‚ÄòSOLID‚Äô articles! Well yes but I just can‚Äôt be silent this has been too long in the coming. SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns. The problem with most SOLID articles is that you walk away with more ambiguity than when you started. Although well-meaning if not well understood it can often have the opposite of its intended effect.Ambiguity is the enemy of productivity. You cannot be effective if you are confused.What I found personally is that heuristics are an effective antidote to indecision. This is why I want to share the heuristics that I use but I encourage everyone to find their own. It‚Äôs an incredibly insightful journey to undertake and helps clarify the core of the ideas behind SOLID. If nothing else they help serve as tools to better facilitate discussions and elevate the quality of the arguments.Since we are on the topic of clarity I feel it‚Äôs important then to clarify what I mean by ‚Äúheuristic‚Äù. In short, a heuristic is a rule of thumb. While it works, for the most part, there will always be fringe cases where it doesn‚Äôt apply. Wikipedia defines it asan approach to problem-solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but instead sufficient for reaching an immediate goal.That‚Äôs what I am after an imperfect guide but a guide nonetheless to expedite the decision-making process and thinking around SOLID principles. It‚Äôs more important to understand the spirit of the principles at play than strict adherence to the letter of the law.One of the key insights that I have discovered personally is the nature of writing code. Although it seems counter-intuitive most of the code we write is not intended for the computer but rather for each other, for humans. It‚Äôs an important insight because it leads to the realisation that there isn‚Äôt a right and wrong answer when it comes to code, it‚Äôs either really well-designed or poorly designed, and that design is for people. What I have found is that at the heart of the SOLID principles is this idea of the user experience of code. If you are going to be true to the intent of SOLID it would be good design principles around the user experience of the code. A good standard for good design is to maximally minimise the cognitive load. What I aim to do in this series is to show that the SOLID principles are intended at doing exactly that to minimise the cognitive load.With almost all software applications at the start, it‚Äôs near-perfect, clean, elegant and well understood. Over time, however, requirements change in ways that the initial design did not anticipate. Soon something happens to that angelic piece of work it starts to rot, it becomes harder and harder to reason about the code, becomes more fragile and rigid.Everyone agrees, we can see it is a mess we can all agree it is a mess but without it becoming an exercise in personal biases and opinions how could we codify what exactly about this mess is wrong? This where we get into SOLID principles and heuristics. By using SOLID principles and rules of thumb we can avoid at least the obvious errors making our code just that much more stable, maintainable and at least somewhat less messy.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,1,1050,700,1,0,0,11,17
Non-Competes ‚Äî Love Them Or Hate Them,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/non-competes-love-them-or-hate-them-b96b1650c8f8,R. Shawn McBride,454,5,1130,"Michael walked into Andrea‚Äôs office and told her he was quitting. First Andrea was shocked. But the second thought was even scarier. Andrea‚Äôs mind flashed to all of the customers that Michael had relationships with and knew. Easily half the company‚Äôs business could be taken by Michael.Would Michael be able to sell to those customers in his new company? The answer usually comes down to one thing: non-competes. What had Michael agreed to in the past?Non-Competes are often discussed but seldom understood. Usually the question I get with non-competes is whether they do really work. Businesses generally want them to work and employees generally don‚Äôt want them to work.Whether non-competes will work for you, and how well they will work, is generally a matter of state law. The issue can get really interesting for interstate businesses.As a lawyer that deals primarily with issues related to business ownership I can tell you non-competes are critical to something that is near and dear to the hearts of most business owners: valuation. Quite simply the better your non-competes, with co-owners and employees, the better the value of your company.We‚Äôll dig into the why in a minute. Let‚Äôs start with that non-competes are and why they matter.Non-competes are generally created, and enforced, under state law. And while contract law is often fairly uniform throughout the United States non-compete law is anything but uniform.State legislatures, and the court systems, often have to balance two very strongly opposed interests when setting the laws around non-compete. On the one hand businesses want them so that when they train employees and show them their inside information they are not creating their next band of competitors. Meanwhile employees want to be able to change jobs and make a living for themselves and their family.There is a direct tension here. The more the business is allowed to prohibit the former employee from taking action the harder it is for said employee to get a job elsewhere at a good salary. That‚Äôs bad for the employee (and also the state‚Äôs income tax base).But business want the non-competes to protect the customer base they establish. Further many businesses say they will spend more money on training and development when they know the employee won‚Äôt compete with them.So the states work hard to reach a balance. And the balance is different in every state it seems. Some states allow very strong non-competes. Others only allow weak non-competes. And we can see everything in between in other states.Non-competes generally have to be reasonable in terms of three things: time, scope and geography. Time is how long the non-compete covers. Scope is how much it prohibits (think prohibiting selling ice cream vs. selling any food). Geography is how much land area is cover (think one US state versus the entire world).Additionally many states have restrictions on how a non-compete can be entered into. For instance Texas does not generally recognize non-competes entered into by themselves but does respect them when part of another agreement. So just a change in how you word and structure your contracts with non-competes can make a big difference.So make sure that you, or your lawyer, understand the local law and get the wording right.Not only must the wording be precise but the situation around the non-compete can make or break whether it is enforceable in court. For instance in Colorado non-competes are generally prohibited. But, if you dig deeper into the law, you‚Äôll see that you can indeed have non-competes in Colorado for some situations such as the sale of a business.Additionally non-competes usually pick up more than just competition directly. Often issues like solicitation of employees and use of company trade secrets are addressed.When you are putting together your policies and procedures on non-competes for your business you should be thinking about what is important to you and your business model and have your non-competes structure accordingly.When the day comes to sell your business, or bring in investors, your non-competes, their scope and wording, and the facts of your business will be huge drivers or the value of your business. Quite simply most investors want to buy your business as it is without bringing in new competitors. Mergers or changes in ownership often bring about employee changes. And no one really wants a direct competitor that was launched from inside your own company.The owners of the business will likely be asked to sign a non-compete as part of the sale ‚Äî so that‚Äôs not as big of an issue. What is a bigger issue is whether the employees, particularly key employees, can use their knowledge against the company. The less the former employees can hurt the future revenue streams of the company the better the valuation.So some of you are probably reading this and thinking ‚ÄúOh My!‚Äù my business is in real trouble.I didn‚Äôt do non-competes and I know my business value is probably lower.First, take a deep breath. The past does not have to be your future. There is time to start doing things the right way.Depending on where your business is located it might be more challenging to get existing employees under non-competes, but sometimes it‚Äôs easier than you think. And for new employees you can start doing the right things today.So don‚Äôt panic, assess the applicable laws and start increasing the value of your business right away!It‚Äôs never too early to think about the future. And that‚Äôs what non-competes are about ‚Äî protecting your future. So start doing an assessment of where you are and where you are headed and get your non-competes in order.This one of those things were a small time investment can mean big results!**NOTE: Any discussion of legal ideas in any of my public facing materials is not legal advice.

It Was Dark Inside the Wolf,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/it-was-dark-inside-the-wolf-1efe6aa3a2d7,Jessica A,4300,4,825,"That killer line is Margaret Atwood‚Äôs, not in the opening of one of her many novels, but in the video for her Fiction Writing Masterclass. (Yes, she‚Äôs even nailed the first lines in that.)It works to lasso your attention on a number of levels. 1) It takes the familiar (in this case a well-known fairytale) and turns it into the unexpected. 2) it speaks a universal truth ‚Äî that the darkness we should most fear comes from inside of ourselves or others, and 3) it‚Äôs suspenseful and chilling ‚Äî you immediately start worrying about what the wolf is going to do.The more widely I read, and the more feverishly I write, it becomes clear that I need to step up my opening line game. Like yesterday.Somewhere along the line, I got the mistaken impression that sizzling openers were for fiction only and that once I‚Äôd crafted an eye-catching title for my articles, I was basically done.Clearly, I was deluded.Even if your title is tempting, no one‚Äôs going to read your article if the opener‚Äôs drier than a long lost digestive biscuit.And yet, I still believe fiction is the best place to turn for ideas.I‚Äôm going to have a look at what works and why ‚Äî and I‚Äôm taking you with me.Let‚Äôs continue with Atwood and her talent for creating intriguing first lines that hook you like a fish.‚ÄúTen days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.‚Äù ‚Äî The Blind AssassinWhy it works: was this a suicide or an accident? Whose car was driven off the bridge, if not Laura‚Äôs? What does the ending of the war have to do with it? I think you get where I‚Äôm going with this, so I won‚Äôt waste your time. Only to say, create mystery with your first line, then see if you can‚Äôt just sneak a little more in. I want to look at one more Atwood example.‚ÄúWe slept in what had once been the gymnasium.‚Äù ‚Äî The Handmade‚Äôs TaleWhy it works: this opener seamlessly blends the familiar with the unfamiliar. Gymnasium? Yup, we‚Äôve got that. But the fact that the writer is sleeping in there, and alongside others, is distinctly odd. Immediately, our minds flit to some kind of dystopia ‚Äî perhaps a natural disaster, or even some kind of imprisonment situation? Blending the known with the unknown throws your reader for a loop, and unkind as that sounds, it‚Äôs always a great start.Let‚Äôs move on to the magical realists and their emotionally charged, sensorily rich writing; Isabel Allende, for example.‚Äú‚ÄòBarabbas came to us by sea,‚Äù the child Clara wrote in her delicate calligraphy.‚Äù ‚Äî The House of the SpirtsWhy it works: as before, we have questions upon questions, but there are other things at play here too. Allende uses the concepts of journey and adventure to sweep us into the excitement of the story. She also gives us an uncanny visual image ‚Äî a child‚Äôs delicate calligraphy. I don‚Äôt know about you, but most children of my acquaintance go in for bubble writing with hearts over the ‚ÄúI‚Äùs. This opener thus imparts valuable information: 1) this story is set at a time in the past when children might be taught things like calligraphy 2) Clara is quite possibly a remarkable infant. In essence, it cleverly sets the scene without actually spelling anything out.And what about Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and this infamous opener?‚ÄúIt was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.‚ÄùWhy it works: anything that invokes our senses helps us to feel connected to a story, and it‚Äôs the same for anything that speaks straight to our emotional experiences. Curiosity plus senses plus emotions: I‚Äôm tempted to say this opening line has it all, but there‚Äôs still one thing left to cover, and Agatha Christie is the master of it.‚ÄúYou do see, don‚Äôt you, that she‚Äôs got to be killed?‚Äù ‚Äî Appointment with DeathWhy it works: firstly, dialogue plonks the reader unceremoniously right at the centre of the action ‚Äî that makes them feel part of the story instantly. Secondly, it‚Äôs controversial, because it seems to fly in the face of every detective fiction rule there is. Could Christie really be exposing the murderers before the mystery‚Äôs even begun? It must be a bluff! But what if it‚Äôs a double bluff? It sends the reader‚Äôs head into a spin. And it‚Äôs successful for another reason too: it tells us that someone is going to die, or at the very least is wanted dead, and that sends chills up our spines.Sadly, my openers are still lingering in the dry digestive category, and I‚Äôve got a hunch it‚Äôs going to take considerable practice to dial them up to something halfway good. But this feels like a start.Over the next few weeks, I‚Äôm going to experiment with weaving some of these fiction writers‚Äô opening magic into my own work.

"Startup Fear: Feed off it, don‚Äôt let it feed off you!",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/startup-fear-feed-off-it-dont-let-it-feed-off-you-c2931b49fa80,Dan Todd,291,4,815,"Fear, we all experience it in our lives and is often associated as a negative emotion. And that is fairly true ‚Äî fear isn‚Äôt nice. Whether it‚Äôs a fear of public speaking, a fear of the unknown, the fear of death, the fear of building relationships and losing them, it‚Äôs all the same.An awful feeling that we often try to avoid and mitigate as much as possible. A feeling that also drives us to do things we normally wouldn‚Äôt, for better or worse.But fear is also a force for good.Fear is an emotion all living creatures feel, and with good reason. It‚Äôs part of what gives every living being the desire to live and protect themselves as much as possible from harm.Theoretically, fear makes you avoid situations and do whatever you can to come out unscathed. This is more commonly known as flight, from the fight or flight concept I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all familiar with.But fear can absolutely become something good, if you fight. And by fighting the fear, you can achieve things you never, ever would have if you gave in to it.An example of this which I often use is suddenly becoming unemployed. If somebody suddenly and unexpectedly loses their job from redundancy, business closure etc.That person is then scared ‚Äî they need to find another job before their money runs out. Because of that fear, they‚Äôll do a lot more to find a job than somebody who is still employed but is perhaps looking for a new job at some point. That person is still comfy, and safe, and not fearful.And when it comes to starting up your own business and becoming an entrepreneur, the same concept applies ‚Äî if you control the of the risk involved. The risk of losing your savings, of running out of money before you make any, the fear of being a laughing stock to your peers, the fear of having to go back to working for someone else.By recognising the fear, and facing it head on with a determination to succeed and do all that it takes, any startup and entrepreneur can unleash unlimited potential and success.I‚Äôm not saying that fighting fear will always lead to a positive outcome ‚Äî Startups are always risky, and even the most determined and brave entrepreneur who works 20 hours days to try to make it work can still ultimately and sadly fail.But by fighting that fear, you have a great opportunity to unleash so much more from yourself. Don‚Äôt try to ignore the fear or run from it.Recognise the fear, understand it ‚Äî give it a wave! And know that no matter as difficult as it seems, by pushing towards that fear you can come out on top.The inspiration for my post on fear is it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm facing every single day. I‚Äôve recently taking the decision to resign from my full time job, and go self employed as The Marketeer.I‚Äôve always wanted to go self employed, but always thought I need X savings and be as prepared as possible. But in truth I know that if I didn‚Äôt take the plunge, I‚Äôd never have been prepared enough to go from it.In truth, I‚Äôm in a very risky situation right now with only limited funds to live off. I already have some clients and work which is great, but not enough to replace my salary right now.I‚Äôm scared and every single day I think I‚Äôve made a terrible mistake or that I‚Äôve ruined things for me and my Fiance. But then other times I‚Äôm so happy I made that decision because I know I probably never would have.The feeling of fear is absolutely awful ‚Äî I can‚Äôt deny that. But I‚Äôve accepted the fear and I‚Äôm using it to propel my efforts to make 100% sure I can make my self employment work before my money runs out.I will do what it takes ‚Äî if I have to work 20 hour days for months on end, so be it. My goals of self employment and what that will mean for me and my partner is so worth the work, the stress, the fear.I can do it ‚Äî and I will. But only as long as I greet fear as a friend, and not a foe. I‚Äôm using it to my advantage, to drive me to do what it takes to win. I‚Äôm not running from it, rescinding my resignation and running back to the 9‚Äì5 rat race I‚Äôve always hated.I hope my story relates to others who are in a similar situation and have just taken the plunge, or are a few months into launching a startup. Or maybe you‚Äôre in the rat race still, but have a desire to get out and become an entrepreneur.Whatever your situation, always try to feed off the fear you face and let it serve you ‚Äî don‚Äôt let it feed off you!",18/07/2019,0,0,1,0,1050,602,1,0,0,0,16
The Best Way to Respond to Rejection ‚Äî Don‚Äôt.,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/the-best-way-to-respond-to-rejection-dont-3422af40c9aa,Caren Lissner,1300,5,1048,"No one likes rejection ‚Äî literary, romantic, or otherwise. But most of us, male or female, learn to accept it. People‚Äôs tastes differ. You can write what you think is a grand novel or essay, and an editor might find that it‚Äôs not to their taste. (And it‚Äôs happened even to best-selling authors, as I wrote in my piece on why rejection is just a step on the way to literary success).If you submit your writing to an editor and he or she rejects it, it‚Äôs usually a good idea not to respond. If it‚Äôs a close contact or a person who gave a very kind or personal response, you can thank them ‚Äî but if it‚Äôs a standard rejection and the editor is busy, it may be best to avoid even a thank you.But there have been cases in which someone got so angry over a rejection that they wrote back and either berated the editor and publication, or tried to convince the person (in vain) to change his or her mind.Some people get so angry over a rejection, they write back to berate the publication.This past May, author and editor Roxane Gay ‚Äî who edits Gay Mag on Medium ‚Äî wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúSometimes writers respond when you reject submissions. Most responses are fine. Generally people want feedback. But then there are the men.‚ÄùShe published a response from a man saying, ‚ÄúMy essays and memoirs will always be in demand‚Äù and that when she rejects someone like him, she‚Äôs ‚Äútaking a greater risk: I (or some other real nonfiction writer) may never send you anything else again.‚Äù‚ÄúMy essays and memoirs will always be in demand.‚Äù ‚Äî Rejected ManNew York Times editor Daniel Jones, who edits the popular Modern Love column in the paper, has published a growing list of tips for submitting. He writes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found that writers who submit to Modern Love are overwhelmingly grateful for the notice and gracious if they choose to respond. Unfortunately, the ease of email also spurs a few to vent their disappointment.‚ÄùHe adds, ‚ÄúSeveral times a month I field responses like these: ‚ÄòOh, well. Your loss.‚Äô ‚ÄòLame!‚Äô ‚ÄòI think your choice is a foolish one.‚Äô I wish these writers had thought twice (or three times!) before firing off such self-sabotaging notes.‚ÄùThe editor of the daily humor portion of McSweeney‚Äôs Internet Tendency, one of the most well-regarded satire sites, has a specific Twitter hashtag for those who fight about rejection: #welcometothejerkfolder. In an October 2018 Tweet, he writes about how he sent a very polite response to one author who submitted: ‚ÄúWe just ran another piece of satire about college app essays, so I‚Äôm going to pass. Thanks for thinking of us just the same.‚Äù The author responded, ‚ÄúLol, like I care, whatever dude‚Äù and added about a baker‚Äôs dozen exclamation points. That was one of the nicer responses.There appears to be a gender-based trend in who responds angrily to rejection.There appears to be a gender-based trend in who responds angrily to rejection.‚ÄúEven though only 20 percent of submissions to Modern Love come from men,‚Äù wrote Daniel Jones in 2015, ‚Äúthey send more than 90 percent of the angry emails I receive in response to being turned down.‚ÄùMore than one author has drawn a parallel between men who can‚Äôt take literary rejection and those who can‚Äôt handle romantic rejection. In a piece called ‚ÄúWhen men are rejected they demand answers,‚Äù an author writes, ‚ÄúMen, either used to getting what they want or, if they don‚Äôt, bullying their way into getting it, are flabbergasted when they are rejected ‚Äî not only by women, it seems, but by editors and others who might be in a position to withhold that which they are entitled to: jobs, wealth, power.‚ÄùThere are parallels between men who can‚Äôt take literary rejection and those who can‚Äôt handle romantic rejection.She notes, ‚ÄúI would make out with a guy after a date and he‚Äôd proceed to whine and complain and pout when I declined sex. I see it in my relationships ‚Äî in boyfriends who are just so confident! So many of them don‚Äôt worry about being alone, about not finding a partner, they don‚Äôt worry about whether or not their partners are sexually satisfied‚Ä¶meanwhile I‚Äôm in the bathroom every night carefully examining my pores and applying over-priced wrinkle cream, wondering if my partner will leave me a couple of years down the road‚Ä¶‚ÄùIn women, she finds humility instead of entitlement ‚Äîresulting in a desire to do better, and to make others happy. After her own Modern Love essay was rejected, ‚ÄúI was disappointed but not angry. Certainly it never occurred to me to demand an explanation or to respond in shock: ‚ÄòHow dare you! Justify yourself!‚Äô ‚ÄùLearning how to take literary rejection may be as important as learning to write. Perhaps our kids should be taught this growing up: Not everyone is going to want us (either to date us or publish us). We need to accept it or express our disappointment in a healthy way.There‚Äôs a story I‚Äôve heard about Modern Love but can‚Äôt seem to find on the internet: It involves a woman who was rejected by Modern Love and forwarded the rejection to her mother, who responded with something like, ‚ÄúScrew the New York Times!‚Äù Then the woman accidentally forwarded her mom‚Äôs response to Daniel Jones.But this is actually the absolute correct person you should vent to about your rejection: Your mom. Or your friends, therapist, or writing group. Not to an editor.Also, you can take a breath, think about how to improve (as women tend to do after romantic rejection), and try again ‚Äîlike this dude did.When his followup piece for Modern Love was accepted, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember a moment in my career in which I have been so happy,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI used to write about port-a-potties.‚Äù‚ÄúI used to write about port-a-potties.‚Äù ‚Äî Accepted ManHis last line evinces humility and self-reflection ‚Äî qualities that Daniel Jones says go a long way in Modern Love pieces.Jones and that dude are both real men ‚Äî manly men.

It‚Äôs so easy to go to wordpress and set up a blog about anything you please. You can churn out some content and have your blog running in an hour or two. That‚Äôs the whole point of blogging: writing about whatever you want, no matter who you are.Maybe this is where the bad taste came from. The fact that anyone can do it and that it isn‚Äôt controlled. I figured ‚Äî and hoped ‚Äî that with a University degree I was better than the rest of the bloggers out there. I may have been thinking of myself a little too highly (definitely), but I didn‚Äôt want to assume that 4 years of studying English and writing essays until your hands shook and your chest tightened from over-caffeination was for naught. I couldn‚Äôt understand how someone could just start writing away and become a success without even going to school. How could someone who doesn‚Äôt seem to have a basic understanding on proper punctuation be making so much money?Marketing, of course. Successful bloggers are amazing at marketing themselves and their content. I never went to school for marketing or business, and some of them never did either, but they learned as they grew. I didn‚Äôt have any idea about how marketing worked until I worked as a Realtor, graduating to a position that revolved around that magical word: marketing. I didn‚Äôt have to go to business school or take any courses in marketing; I was taught by my boss and we tweaked things until our campaigns shone. We learned along the way. Which is exactly what bloggers do.Why do we look down our noses at those YouTube beauty stars who are making a killing doing what they love. Isn‚Äôt that the whole reason we look for a meaningful career? To do what we love and succeed at it?But, for some reason, I figured that blogging wasn‚Äôt for me. It was for all of those #basicbitches out there who love Pinterest and who want to talk about fashion and style and how their days differ, but are yet the same, to everyone out there.Oh shit, that is me.It was my superiority complex that was holding me back from experiencing something new, engrained in me from a young age that I could do anything, as long as I worked for it, as long as I studied for it. If I just got that piece of paper from an educational institute of higher learning, I‚Äôd be set. Because I had ‚Äòexperience‚Äô, I‚Äôd be ready to tackle those adult jobs and do what I love. But, like we all know, or at least find out once we graduate, that‚Äôs not exactly the case.People with PhDs and Masters are working menial jobs. And, maybe they like their menial job. Maybe University was used as what it was made for: a tool for better learning instead of a tool for finding a job.Success (in the term of career and monetary aspirations) doesn‚Äôt have to come from higher education, or from knowing everything about the subject of your business. We all know that there are highly successful entrepreneurs who don‚Äôt have a business degree to their name, who have never thought of themselves as the Owner or CEO of a company. But, they had a great idea and worked at it until they made it. Entrepreneurs aren‚Äôt made in school, a lot of them just happen.The same as bloggers.Why do we look at entrepreneurs with awe, admiration dripping from our lips, while we look at bloggers like teenage sell-outs? Why do we look down our noses at those YouTube beauty stars who are making a killing doing what they love. Isn‚Äôt that the whole reason we look for a meaningful career? To do what we love and succeed at it? It took me years to realize that I could do what I loved, as long as I wasn‚Äôt worried about getting paid for it, at least not right away.Very rare are people born like Hunter S. Thompson, ready to throw down genius while blitzed out of their mind.My feeling of disgust turned to curiosity and then to love. Although I‚Äôm still shy to tell people, especially family members, that I‚Äôm a blogger, blogging is something that I absolutely love. Am I going to make a YouTube channel and give tutorials that bring people to a wonderful tizzy? Highly doubtful. But, am I going to write about whatever I damn well please (of course, as long as it pertains to my audience‚Ä¶there‚Äôs the kicker) and feel good about myself? Build a portfolio of published work that someone can look at and either see I‚Äôm the right fit or toss aside with the rest of the bloggers out there? Absolutely.In the art world, creativity is God. You‚Äôre nothing without your voice, your creative license that you take on everything you touch and write. Blogging is just another form of a creative outlet. It‚Äôs just another medium on which to express ourselves.It‚Äôs time to stop thinking of blogging as the slug of writing because there are tons of writers out there doing their craft, honing their skills and working it ‚Äî for themselves. While great writing is something many a great writer is born with, it‚Äôs also something that‚Äôs learned. Something that‚Äôs mentored, that‚Äôs edited profusely over the years. Very rare are people born like Hunter S. Thompson, ready to throw down genius while blitzed out of their mind. The only thing I can throw down while 1/4 of the way HST blitzed is my dignity. Taking the time to feel it all out, to find your voice is a smart move. Blogging can help you with that.Where else can you combine your love for fashion, gardening, pets, homesteading, books, crafting (the list is practically endless) and writing without getting rejected over and over?",18/07/2019,0,0,0,3,1050,590,1,0,0,0,72
Superhuman AI Is Not a Myth,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/superhuman-ai-is-not-a-myth-ff6f63f5e75d,Hein de Haan,411,6,1038,"Most readers of Data Driven Investor will, I suspect, have heard of Artificial Superintelligence: a future Artificial Intelligence that is (much) more intelligent than even Albert Einstein or whoever your favorite genius is. Important thinkers like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and the late physicist Stephen Hawking have warned us that such an AI might doom humanity. Although I am optimistic, I share these worries: by definition, a superintelligent AI will be very good at pursuing its goal, granted that it‚Äôs programmed with one. Unless it‚Äôs also programmed to be friendly towards humans (so-called Friendly AI), an Artificial Superintelligence might, in order to reach its goal, perform actions that hurt humanity. They might even result in human extinction. On the other hand, Artificial Superintelligence could invent human immortality too. It really depends on the circumstances. It is because of the huge impact, either positive or negative, that I am concerned about this topic.In an article called ‚ÄúThe Myth of a Superhuman AI‚Äù, published on Wired, Kevin Kelly argues that such a takeover scenario by superhuman AI rests on assumptions that have no evidence. As I think Kevin is mistaken, I decided to write this post as a reaction. Kevin has a number of assumptions that, according to him, need to be true in order for a superintelligence to arise ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Let‚Äôs discuss them one by one.www.datadriveninvestor.comKevin Kelly states that the first assumption needed for the rise of superhuman AI is that AI is already getting smarter than us, and does so at an exponential rate. I‚Äôm not here to argue whether this assumption itself is false or true. What I can say is that it would be very hard to determine its truth, because it depends on many things: the exact definition of intelligence (domain-specific, like Chess, or general), the amount of researchers in the past, the present and the projected amount for the future, etc. Most people will agree that AI is getting smarter, though. And unexpected breakthroughs do happen. For example, AI in the form of AlphaZero is now way better than humans at Go, while in the past, humans could easily beat computers at this game. I can‚Äôt determine whether the progress is exponential; but given previous breakthroughs, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if AI makes another leap to human-level intelligence in the next ten years and to superintelligence soon after.I obviously agree with Kevin that this assumption is needed for the rise of superintelligence. I also think that this assumption is true. We will build Artificial General Intelligence: AI that is as smart as humans across there intellectual domains. While it is true that AI‚Äôs build today are mostly Narrow AI‚Äôs, designed for specific tasks only, the earlier example of AlphaZero is already relatively general: it can teach itself to play Go, Chess and Shogi. Any continued progress in making AI‚Äôs more general will lead to Artificial General Intelligence. Whether this will be ‚Äúsoon‚Äù depends, of course, on the definition of ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. The (monetary) rewards for building general AI will be huge though, and tech companies like Google certainly realize this. I suspect that the more progress we make with realizing Artificial General Intelligence, the more money will be spent on its development, speeding up progress.Well, this is a controversial subject. We have certainly modeled/imitated a (large) number of parts of our intelligence. I see no reason to assume this won‚Äôt happen for the rest of our intelligence, as (most of) our intelligence happens in the brain, which consists entirely of neurons ‚Äî groups of which have already been modeled. Whether intelligence in silicon will ever be exactly human is difficult to say, but it‚Äôs quite certain that our level of intelligence can be created in silicon. To say this can‚Äôt happen is to say there is something special about our brains relative to silicon that makes it impossible to model, and current evidence from neuroscience doesn‚Äôt suggest this is the case.This certainly doesn‚Äôt need to be true in order for a superintelligence to arise. All that is necessary is that it is possible to be more intelligent than humans. Given the small size and low signaling speed of our brains, it seems silly to think we humans have the highest possible level of intelligence.Well, it‚Äôs called superintelligence for a reason. Intelligence refers at least in part to one‚Äôs ability to solve problems, so a superintelligence will, by definition, be better at that than humans. Kevin defends his position by saying problems need more than intelligence to be solved: experiments need to be done. While this is certainly true and will slow down progress made by the AI, it doesn‚Äôt mean these problems won‚Äôt be solved. If a problem can in principle be solved, there is a level of intelligence high enough to solve it.Kevin Kelly goes on to talk about five heresies he thinks have more evidence in support. Most of these I more or less agree with or have discussed before ‚Äî the first one, however, is still worth discussing.I agree that intelligence can be measured along multiple dimensions. This, however, does in no way mean ‚Äúsmarter than humans‚Äù is meaningless. If one AI plays only Chess and another plays only Go, it might be impossible to say which is smarter in general. However, another AI that plays both Chess and Go better than both of the first two AI‚Äôs is definitely more intelligent than the first two. So even though intelligence is measured along multiple dimensions here (Chess and Go), it is still possible to determine a level of intelligence. One can even imagine the fourth AI that‚Äôs better at Chess than the third AI and just as good at Go as the third one; this AI would be even more intelligent than the third one.Superintelligent AI is coming. Whether it is in the next ten or fifty years (or even further in the future), it will change our society strongly and permanently. Whether the impact will be positive or negative is up to us. The results could be either human extinction or human immortality, so we need to think about this carefully, and as we don‚Äôt know the timeframe, we should think about it NOW.Originally published at https://www.datadriveninvestor.com on July 18, 2019.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,5,697,363,4,0,0,7,85
Why Writers Should Make Tech Work For Them,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/why-writers-should-make-tech-work-for-them-6abdfa9c69a2,Noah Rue,223,4,937,"Implement technology into you‚Äôre writing and it will never be outdated.Long gone are the days of inkwells, fountain pens, and even typewriters. Today, being successful is as much about getting your name out there as it is about the craft and technical skills needed to create. Learning to write in the 21st century means that you need to familiarize yourself with modern tools that can boost your creativity, organize your workflow, and even connect you to your audience or next big gig.Here are a few ways you can make some of the newest technological advancements work for you and your writing business.If you work on collaborative projects, or even just network with others to stay up to date about recent changes in the field and job opportunities, you need to consider some of the top apps for team collaboration. Applications like Trello, for example, can make the most complicated projects look simple when you break them down into cards or tasks.If you‚Äôre looking for ways to make documents accessible with colleagues spread out across the country or even the globe, utilize the Google Suite of products like Google sheets, docs, forms, and calendar. You can work on stories, databases, or even collect information from others with ease and then sync it all together on a shared calendar. What more, because the Google suite lives on the cloud, you can catch up on work anywhere just by signing into your Google or Chrome browser account.Believe it or not, not all professionals chose email as their number one way of communicating with others. If you want to stay current, you might have to go outside of your comfort zone and try new ways of keeping up with business communication etiquette. Consider texting clients if they provide their number, or even doing a video chat through Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts. These communication tools might make you a bit nervous the first few times you use them, but once you see how easy and fast they are to use, you‚Äôll be a pro in no time.Creating your own website to advertise your skills as a writer, copyeditor, and more, is easier today than ever before ‚Äî and cost-effective, too. It can be one of the quickest ways to get your name out there and showcase some of your best writing samples, as well as show off some of your proudest published work. Once you get your website designed the way you want it, potential readers and clients can find you through your site and even communicate with you easily.You can create a blog to show current work or use your site to sell your books. If you want to keep in contact with your readers so that you can notify them of new blog posts or books, consider using an app like MailChimp to create a mailing list of those who want to be informed of updates.If you create invoices with a standard processing program and insist on mailing them by snail-mail, it‚Äôs time to turn to technology to bill and collect payments. Programs like FreshBooks and Wave can help you create professional-looking invoices complete with your logo. Set up each client and save their details so that next month, it‚Äôs as easy as a few clicks to prepare the invoice and get paid faster, without having to worry about your letter getting lost in the mail.Once you get each client‚Äôs information entered, you can create and send invoices online. Many of these programs even connect to your bank so that you can accept payment through the app too.If you‚Äôre looking for an easy way to create images that draw readers to your blog or website, you need an online design tool. Canva is an excellent free site where you can create professional and unique images for everything from your blog post and layout, to your social media accounts. The greatest thing about Canva is not only that it‚Äôs easy to use, but most people can do everything they need with the standard, free account.This tool is also an excellent resource if you‚Äôre looking to create a website but don‚Äôt want to spend hundreds of dollars on a designer, or if you want to take advantage of a mailing list to readers and fans like mentioned above. Use their preset templates to gather a few ideas of what you like and then get started. You can easily change colors, shapes, and fonts with just a few clicks.Most people think that they can multitask well. However, experts agree that it‚Äôs difficult to do any one task to your full potential if you‚Äôre trying to do three or four others at the same time. If you get easily distracted by emails, social media sites, or the internet, try using Freedom.This app locks you out of distracting websites so that you can fully engage on one task at a time, across many devices and not just your computer. Freedom work on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, and is used by more than one million people to increase their productivity and boost their ability to focus.Writers use tech every day. From checking your grammar to learning the newest ways to combat writer‚Äôs block, you can make technology work for you. Once you get the hang of these apps and other tools, you‚Äôll see the ease and convenience they add to your business or daily creative routine, and you might even increase your readership or land a few new high-paying clients. Regardless of which tools you try, we hope you find them useful, and you learn how to make them work the best for you.",19/07/2019,1,0,2,0,684,500,1,0,0,16,87
How I Got Out of My Writing Slump ‚Äî And How You Can Too,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/how-i-got-out-of-my-writing-slump-and-how-you-can-too-544cdd0bb6d7,Matthew Taylor,167,4,895,"I tried diving deeper into the world of writing recently, but it seemed like I‚Äôd hit a wall. I felt unmotivated to write, and it felt like my writing skills weren‚Äôt improving whatsoever. I needed something to get me out of my writing slump. That‚Äôs when I had an idea. I would start writing in genres that I was unfamiliar with.Learning to write in different genres is a great way to give yourself the motivation to write and to improve your writing skills. You‚Äôll also reach an audience that you normally wouldn‚Äôt have. You might even discover a new genre of writing that you really like!I find that taking a new approach to a problem is a good way to get that problem resolved. So that‚Äôs exactly what I did. Rather than looking into my folder of writing ideas and then writing about them halfheartedly, I found some writing contests that I was unfamiliar with the genre and style of writing they were after but seemed interesting. What I like about writing contests is that the idea is already there for you ‚Äî you merely have to tailor your writing to that topic. Many writing contests also offer prizes, and who doesn‚Äôt like winning prizes?Had I simply kept using ideas from my folder of writing ideas, I wouldn‚Äôt have produced the quality of work that I have come to expect of myself. My heart just wouldn‚Äôt have been in my work ‚Äî and my readers probably would have known that. The best writing comes from those who actually want to write. No one wants to read anything from an author who doesn‚Äôt care. An author‚Äôs lack of enthusiasm is reflected in the quality of their work. Who wants to read something that‚Äôs poorly written?The best writing comes from those who actually want to write.To get out of my slump, I entered a couple of writing contests. Both were after content that was very different than what I was comfortable writing about. I‚Äôll admit that it seemed daunting at first. My first thought was ‚ÄúWhat if the jury doesn‚Äôt like what I wrote?‚Äù. After a little more reflection, I concluded, ‚ÄúSo what? If I‚Äôm proud of what I wrote, that‚Äôs all that matters.‚ÄùThe ‚Äúso what‚Äù attitude is a great one to have. The worst that can happen when you enter these kinds of contests is that you don‚Äôt win. You don‚Äôt get published, and you don‚Äôt win a prize. Maybe the members of the jury that judges your work think that you‚Äôre a bad writer. But that jury is composed of just a few people. There are billions of other people in the world that don‚Äôt think any less of you! While it is important to be cognizant of your audience, having a ‚Äúso what‚Äù attitude is great for a writer‚Äôs self-esteem. For every person that doesn‚Äôt like what you‚Äôve written, there‚Äôs bound to be another that does. Always know that somewhere out there is someone who will enjoy your work, even if someone else doesn‚Äôt.I wrote two very different things for the two writing contests I entered. One was a fictional story about a cult in the American Midwest. The other was an essay on the effects of a carbon tax on the Canadian economy. I didn‚Äôt win the contest I wrote the story for. I was a little bummed out at first, but then I remembered, ‚Äúso what?‚Äù. Even if I didn‚Äôt win, I got out of my comfort zone as a writer. I got some experience writing in a genre I was unfamiliar with. I had a draft I could work with that I could refine for another audience. And I had a great time writing my story. That‚Äôs all that really matters, right? I‚Äôm still waiting on the results of the essay contest, but if I don‚Äôt win, I‚Äôll just have to remember ‚Äúso what?‚Äù and I‚Äôll be just fine. Even if I don‚Äôt win, I still got writing experience and a draft that I can refine.While I was getting out of my writing slump, I never forgot my folder of writing ideas. There were a few things that I desperately wanted to write about, but I wanted to finish my projects for the writing contests before bringing any of those ideas to fruition. I didn‚Äôt want to get distracted by any new projects. If I did, I feel like my writing wouldn‚Äôt have been of the quality that I have come to expect of myself. I would have become discouraged and would have gone back right to square one of my slump.I‚Äôve resumed my writing journey slowly but surely. I‚Äôve gotten out of my slump ‚Äî in fact, this article is the first I‚Äôve written since I‚Äôve gotten out of it. I can‚Äôt wait to see where I go with my writing for my next project.Everybody hits a slump at one point or another. The key is getting out of that slump ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where people start to have trouble.My advice to those who are in a bit of a writing slump: write something different than what you normally would. It will be a change of pace that can help you get out of your slump. You‚Äôll gain skills and experience that you normally wouldn‚Äôt have. You‚Äôll thank yourself for trying something new, and you‚Äôll have become a better writer.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,0,1000,668,1,0,0,2,93
Hybrid Mobile App Development Frameworks for 2019,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/hybrid-mobile-app-development-frameworks-for-2019-ac56b1e65f29,Shakun Grover,29,6,1270,"The digital balloon is inflating with an unprecedented rate.

Like all the other handy frameworks, PhoneGap allows the developer to make preview results on hardware thus to apply necessary changes in the code. It can run on all Android and iOS platforms; you can also get the leverage to add more functionality with the additional plugins.It acquires an intuitive desktop for developing mobile apps and then serves the app created on the desktop to connect mobile devices with it. There are no convoluted text commands to struggle with.3. Xamrin ‚Äî A Coder‚Äôs Delight, Top-Notch Cross-Platform ToolFounded by Microsoft in 2011, Xamarin is the hottest tool which is used to build hybrid platform apps. Developers can leverage the same code for including different operating systems, such as ‚Äî Android, Windows, macOS, iOS and so on. Having a great user interface, it not only assists developers to evolve native apps but also controls the app to provide eventual user-experience. Along with this, the Xamarin mobile app framework helps to generate productive and high-performing code which can access every native API.

React Native ‚Äî A Preferred Cross-Platform Solution for iOS and Android App DevelopmentIt is another popular cross-platform framework which was introduced via Facebook (the social media giant). Although it made its inception about three years ago in 2013 it has become one of the preferred choices for the mobile app developers. Along with this, React Native offers ample support to IDEs and other tools of mobile app development. It is assumed to be an optimal JavaScript framework in order to create native apps for iOS and Android both platforms. Apart from code reusability, it permits you to preview results at once besides giving ready-to-apply parts, therefore shortening the developing time significantly. It conjointly offers you access to sure nice native functionalities like measuring instrument and camera. The result it renders may be a high-quality native-like program.5. Corona SDK ‚Äî Create Compatible Cross-Platform Apps in Minimum TimeCorona SDK is ten times faster in comparison with other mobile app development platforms.one of its crucial aspect is it is supported by Lua that is a light-weight programming language which offers speed, flexibility as well as ease of usage to develop apps.

How the Postmates‚Äô Economy is Bleeding us all Dry,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-postmate-apocalypse-9f6453396a78,Rob Healy,76,8,1792,"#ThePodiemPapers are an ongoing series of short essays aimed at heightening the public conversation around core issues intersecting journalism and social media._________________________________________________________________E.O Wilson said it best. ‚ÄúWe are a civilization of Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology.‚ÄùIn Silicon Valley, this line is now as overused as it is prescient. One imagines it almost succinct enough for a Tesla bumper sticker. What is worth noting though is that no one ever goes on to clarify what ‚Äúgod-like‚Äù technology is actually referring to. All of it? Nuclear Weapons? The new iPad Air?I would venture that Wilson was referring to our hassle-free reality-on-demand personalized universes. The brand new Economy-of-Now. The ‚Äúgod-like‚Äù power of simply imagining a ‚Äúthing,‚Äù and within minutes, the ‚Äúthing‚Äù shows up at your doorstep. Whether the time between ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù and ‚Äúdoorstep arrival‚Äù is 5 minutes or 5 hours is irrelevant. What Wilson is alluding to is existence without friction. A world where we never have to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with anything.Netflix tailors its algorithms so as to ensure you don‚Äôt waste a single extra minute more than you have to on a show you might not enjoy. Amazon shuttles every conceivable consumer product on earth in through your front door, oftentimes within the same day. (*I recently attended a party where the host ordered 50 lbs. of live crawfish to their front door via Amazon Prime.) Tinder and Bumble and Hinge et al. have turned romance and love seeking into a sanitized, crowdsourced, swapmeet. Postmates has turned Michelin star restaurants into pizza delivery outposts. It is only a matter of time before we are all ordering young aspirational college graduates to come into our homes to brush our teeth for us while we‚Äôre sleeping because you know, efficiency.The app I feel best epitomizes this frictionless ‚Äúreality-on-demand‚Äù phenomenon is Instacart. The grocery store shopping app where you choose your groceries online, and they are delivered to your door a few hours later. Your only interaction with sentient life coming in the form of a phone call from an overqualified part-timer calling to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Mr. Healy, the Sour Patch Kids watermelon candies you selected are unavailable. Would you like me to exchange them out for the original Sour Patch Kids non-watermelon flavored option or would you prefer that I source an alternative off-brand sour patch option?‚Äù If you‚Äôd like, this whole interaction can take place via text.What I want to argue here is that this solipsistic trend toward isolated, immediate gratification, without any human interaction in between, is exacting a spiritual tax. A tax that has disastrous downstream consequences.This new immediacy economy is antagonizing the worst psychological aspects of consumer capitalism. The angst plaguing most millennials and Gen Y/Z culture today is, I believe, a direct result of this consumer contact-emptiness. Meaningless exchanges with transactional actors, hidden behind screens, passed off as meaningful interaction. A disease of disconnection spread willingly, all in the service of ‚Äúutility‚Äù and ‚Äúconvenience.‚ÄùWhat we are experiencing now is the inevitable endpoints of an efficiency curve that was set in motion many years ago. Asking a farmer to kill our cattle, a butcher to cut it up, a store to package and sell it, and an errand boy to bring it to your front door, all so we can distance ourselves from the messiness. Free from friction and effort. Free from the chaos of the outside world.All of this ultimately limiting our ability to make any sense of our place and purpose inside of an interconnected supply/demand web. Feeling less like humans in charge of our own destinies and more like endpoints of some MegaCorp‚Äôs transglobal supply chain. Multiply this across every domain of a free-market economy and then we feign shock when rates of depression, loneliness, and dislocation begin to skyrocket.Imagine the following hypothetical example: It‚Äôs a Sunday morning in a pre- Postmates/Instacart world and you are curled up on your couch, nursing a semi-serious hangover. Your body craves caffeine and carbohydrates in equal measure.So you sort of struggle your way off your couch and you make the whole six-minute walk to the boutique coffee shop at the end of your street that has some hipster name like ‚ÄúDrip.‚ÄùYou get to the front of the line where you are greeted by a college-aged Danielle. Danielle has brown hair, faded freckles, and a few leftover acne scars that let you know she probably wasn‚Äôt bullied in high school but probably wasn‚Äôt the homecoming queen either. This automatically makes you like her more. Danielle greets you with a smile and asks how your Saturday is going. You don‚Äôt go into the gory details.You look in the glass pastry case as if scanning a cage of puppies at a mall pet store hoping one of them calls out and connects with you. You ask Danielle, ‚ÄúAny recommendations?‚Äù She tells you that the new blueberry scones are ‚ÄúAMAZEBALLS‚Äù and that the owner just pulled a new batch of them out of the oven like 30 minutes ago, so they ‚Äúare like still pretty warm.‚Äù It‚Äôs almost as if an old friend was just letting you know how great a new movie or restaurant was.So you oblige and order the scone. As soon as you place it in your mouth, you proceed to spit it back out into your hand, albeit politely. Danielle automatically presumes that she is the one accountable for your regrettable purchasing decision.The exchange then turns to, how Danielle, as a friend, not an employee, can repay you for having just led you astray. Danielle is actively trying to correct the situation, not for economic reasons but for social ones. You pick up on this and try to assure Danielle it had nothing to do with her. That it was your fault. Nonetheless, Danielle makes sure not to charge you for the scone and apologizes again.The mere gesture of Danielle‚Äôs attempt to make up for the lousy scone recommendation is enough to balance back out the customer/employee relationship. Your faith in her and Drip‚Äôs merits as a coffee house that deserves your money and your six-minute walk start to feel a bit more justified.You not only begin to empathize with Danielle as an employee trying to make rent and get through her day but more importantly, you empathize with Drip itself. A sense of solidarity and duty to help keep this coffee shop in business washes over you.You feel for Drip‚Äôs battle against the big chains. You commiserate with the owner‚Äôs dispute over rental fee hikes on their lease deal because the neighborhood is gentrifying so rapidly. You start to get a sense of how difficult it must be for the owner to juggle between keeping her employees covered on Drip‚Äôs medical insurance while also having to throttle everyone‚Äôs hours to make up for those rent increases. You are made tender just considering the fact that the owner of Drip is literally making blueberry scones from scratch every weekend.And all of this because Danielle made a food suggestion that didn‚Äôt agree with you. Unironically, Danielle will be the driving impetus for you to return to Drip in the future. You will both joke about the blueberry scone incident and will build on that moment and start crafting smaller interior ‚Äúinside jokes‚Äù about her recommendations and how she can‚Äôt be trusted. Before long, you will be asking her how her day is going and where she‚Äôs from and how many siblings she has. Background information that allows you to see Danielle as more than just a prompt asking if you want a different kind of watermelon sour-patch kids.Granted, none of this is necessarily breaking news to those who grew up in small towns across America where these kinds of social interactions are part and parcel of daily life. Although, I do think the research has convincingly shown that the forced ‚Äúniceness‚Äù that permeates small-town America has sufficiently disbanded the idea that everything is always cherry pie in Leave-it-to-Beaver-Ville. The cliche about small-town gossip is grounded in some measure of truth to be sure. The point being, this essay is most definitely not a siren call for all cosmopolitan urbanites to take up shop in the countryside tomorrow.What I am getting at though is that I don‚Äôt know any other way of cultivating a sense of community, any sense of belonging in capital R-Reality, without the Danielle face-to-face interplay.The blueberry scone mishap is obviously not an intentional outcome. We can‚Äôt engineer these moments. But that is precisely the point.The Drip incident instead is an unintended outcome whose synergistic effects have exponential payoffs. An accident that forged a friendship and loyalty to a store. An accident that placed the buyer in a more fluid and humane relationship with the seller.The elemental difference between Drip and Postmates or Instacart is that Drip is about keeping the possibility for serendipity open. The possibility to remind ourselves that our entire daily life shouldn‚Äôt have to be about optimizing for efficiency or ease of use. Optimizing so that never again are we forced to suffer one minute of our taste buds suffering because of a crumby scone. Drip is about keeping the door open for a crappy experience to turn into a human one, and discovering a sense of community through that.Our obsession with friction-free utility functions is spiritually bleeding us dry. Depriving us of the texture necessary to actually discover ourselves. The friction required to quite literally ‚Äúknow what we‚Äôre made of‚ÄùOne of the confounding beauties of living in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is that it is chock full of disappointment. Nine times out of ten, we are let down by our interactions with strangers. Punished for being too trusting. Ripped off for being unaware. Someone, somewhere always trying to take advantage of our good natures. And so the compulsion to innoculate ourselves completely from ever feeling let down or taken advantage of is a real one and no one could say that it isn‚Äôt merited.But that compulsion is now disguising itself as ‚Äútime-saving‚Äù and ‚Äúhassle-free.‚Äù ‚ÄúI use Tinder because I just don‚Äôt have the time to go on a bunch of dates.‚Äù No, you use Tinder because getting rejected in the real world is hard. And being let down over and over again after getting your hopes up is even harder.But if we shut out any possibility for that 10th interaction, the Danielle interaction, we preclude any chance, however small, for humanity to take root. Any opportunity to be reminded that we are more than just soulless consumers inside an increasingly robotized marketplace.Afterall, Drip was never about the blueberry scone. The scone was always just an excuse. Drip was about seeking out a human moment instead of a utility optimization curve. It was about hoping for a ‚ÄúDanielle‚Äù mishap inside a world of Sour Patch efficiency.",18/07/2019,3,0,3,42,1033,1028,3,0,0,0,290
How should you kick start your career in Machine Learning?,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-should-you-kick-start-your-career-in-machine-learning-d104437a57f4,myTectra,225,5,550,"Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that renders systems the ability to automatically learn and gain from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning directs toward the advancement of computer programs that can obtain information and use it to learn for themselves.The value of machine learning can be realized when we recognize how clearly machine learning techniques can be applied to solve problems that appear remarkably complicated, for instance, face recognition, you would understand that ML algorithms can tackle several complex problems as long as there is adequate data.www.datadriveninvestor.comLet‚Äôs go deeper into how machine learning actsMachine learning (ML) is broadly categorized into two divisions ‚Äî supervised and unsupervised.Supervised algorithms comprise a data scientist/data analyst who has an intellectual machine learning experience and can give precise data. Data scientists/Data Analyst experts are quite proficient to estimate the data to develop predictions.Unsupervised algorithms are further known neural networks, which links millions of instances regarding training data and automatically recognizing similarities within numerous variables.Here are a few steps to learn Machine Learning:1. Programming Skills- There exist varied languages which render machine learning capabilities. Also, there exists development activity proceeding at an accelerated pace across various languages. Currently ‚ÄúR‚Äù and ‚ÄúPython‚Äù are the most generally used languages also there is sufficient support/community available for both.2. Learn fundamental Descriptive and Inferential Statistics- It is good to have an understanding of the descriptive and inferential statistics before you begin serious machine learning development.3. Data Exploration / Cleaning / Preparation- What discriminates a good machine learning expert from a normal one is its quality of feature engineering and data cleaning that happens on the primary data. The increased quality time you contribute here, the better it is. This process likewise catches the amount of your time and therefore it assists to establish a structure encompassing it.4. Introduction to Machine Learning- There are several sources accessible, to begin with, Machine learning techniques. I would recommend you to choose one of the following two steps depending upon your way of learning:5. Advanced Machine Learning- This step will stay mostly masked if you choose the certification programs but if you are learning from books then these are some fresh topics you will have to study thoroughly. These topics include:6. Gain Experience. Work On Real Projects: Once you‚Äôve acquired a stable hold covering all the technical aspects of Machine Learning, it‚Äôs time to get forward to the field. Exhibit yourself to the industry and attempt to find genuine data science projects on the Internet algorithms like ‚Äúfraud detection‚Äù, ‚Äúspam detection‚Äù, ‚Äúrecommendation system‚Äù, ‚Äúweb document classification‚Äù, and many more.The field of Machine learning is evolving rapidly nowadays with the application of intelligent algorithms being implemented from apps to emails to as far as marketing campaigns. What this implies is that machine learning or Artificial Intelligence is the modern in-demand career option you can prefer.However being a new field relatively, you may have several doubts and confusion as of how you can make yourself to choose Machine learning as a profession. Let‚Äôs consider over some things you need to master to get your career in a machine learning startup.The above-given steps are some ways to start a career in Machine Learning.After graduation, students can opt to pursue careers in artificial intelligence or machine learning, for example as,Originally published at https://www.mytectra.com.",18/07/2019,0,0,17,3,875,555,2,5,0,5,38

Also, we‚Äôll work on a second project ‚Äî Dog-Breed Classifier.In this lesson, we go learn more about neural nets: writing MLP and their comparison to CNN, how CNN work, image augmentations, and other things. I‚Äôll skip this section. Why? Because it is available and free to anyone. There is a free course by Udacity: Introduction to Neural Networks. Lesson 5 of this course contains this lesson, so you can go through it if you are interested.Transfer learning is widely used in a lot of computer vision problems, for example in image classification and segmentation. Basically, it works like this: someone trains a deep CNN on ImageNet or some other big dataset with images and makes it available for public usage. Now we can use this model with pre-trained weights and apply it for our tasks on a smaller dataset and the quality of the model will usually be higher than if we tried to train a new model from scratch.Transfer Learning ‚Äî video with a short description of transfer learning.Useful Layers ‚Äî more information on layers with pre-trained weights.Fine-Tuning ‚Äî how to use pre-trained neural nets.There are four main cases depending on our dataset:New data set is small, new data is similar to original training data.As the new data is smaller and similar to the original data, we can keep most of the pre-trained net and train only the newly added last dense layer.Small Data Set, Different DataAs we have different data, we can‚Äôt use the whole pre-trained net ‚Äî its last layers were trained to look for different features, so it may work not well on our data. And if we keep only several top layers (which recognize more general features), our model would be able to learn features relevant to our dataset.Large Data Set, Similar DataThe idea is that we won‚Äôt overfit if we train the whole net on a large dataset.Large Data Set, Different DataThe idea is that if we have a different dataset than we would need to train our own net.VGG Model & Classifier ‚Äî a practical video.Freezing Weights & Last LayerTraining a ClassifierWeight initialization is really important. Bad initial weights could make neural net unable to train, so a good initialization method should be used.Weight InitializationConstant Weights ‚Äî what would happen if we set constant weights?Random UniformGeneral RuleNormal Distribution ‚Äî weight initialization with normal distributionSolution and Default Initialization ‚Äî solution for exercise notebook on weight initialization. The code is available here.In this lesson, we learn about autoencoders, which can compress the data into a smaller feature space and then turn it back into original dimensions. The code is available here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoderAutoencoders ‚Äî general informationThe simplest form of autoencoders is linear autoencoder. We will learn to use in to compress digits in MNIST dataset.Defining & Training an AutoencoderA Simple SolutionLearnable Upsampling ‚Äî CNN are obviously better at upsampling than linear models.Transpose ConvolutionsConvolutional Autoencoders use convolutional layers and are better than linear.Convolutional AutoencoderConvolutional SolutionUpsampling & DenoisingDenoising autoencoders add random noise to the input data so that the net generalizes better.De-noisingAs I wrote in my first blog post in the series, style transfer allows you to take one image and transfer its style to some other image.This lesson is also available in the free course by Udacity: Introduction to Neural Networks. Lesson 6 of this course contains this lesson, so you can go through it if you are interested. You can find the code here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/style-transferThis is the second project of this course. In this project, we will try to build an algorithm which will at first decide whether an image contains a dog or a human and then it will predict the dog‚Äôs breed. The code template for this project can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classificationLet‚Äôs follow the project‚Äôs steps! We have two datasets: 13233 human photos and 8351 dog images.Detect human facesWe have a code for face detection using OpenCV ‚Äî simple Haar feature-based cascade classifier. It works okay, but not very well as you can see below:So I have decided to use a different approach and used the code from this repository: https://github.com/TropComplique/mtcnn-pytorchIt uses Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks to detect faces and the result is better. But there were many false positives on dog images. I suppose the reason is that the model is tailored to human faces and searches for them even when there are none.Detecting dogsAt first, we use a baseline approach: we simply use a pre-trained VGG16 model to make predictions. Here is a nice trick: you can see all 1000 ImageNet classes here. Keys 151‚Äì268 describe dog breeds, so if VGG16 return prediction in this range, we can say that a dog was detected. And this works great!I was interested in trying other approaches and used pre-trained ResNet-18, the results were even better:Train CNN on dog breeds from scratchNext step is training our own model. At first, we train it from scratch (as an exercise).I wrote my custom Dataset class:And a multi-layer CNN:It achieved a test accuracy of 12% (104 images of 836) which was enough to pass this task.Train CNN using transfer learningIn this section I made a baseline using ResNet-18 again:Obviously, it worked much better, achieving an accuracy of 74% (623/836).Writing the final algorithmAnd now we wrote an algorithm with the following logic:Here are some results:The algorithm didn‚Äôt work very well, I suppose the main reason is small dataset and simple backbone for CNN model. If we had a better model and more data, the results would be better. I suppose this is relevant for any Deep Learning project :)In this lesson, Sebastian Thrun teaches us about his groundbreaking work on detecting skin cancer with convolutional neural networks.IntroSkin CancerSurvival Probability of Skin CancerMedical ClassificationThe dataImage ChallengesIt is really difficult to find skin cancer:Training the Neural NetworkRandom vs Pre-initialized WeightValidating the TrainingSensitivity and SpecificityDiagnosing CancerRefresh on ROC CurvesROC CurveComparing our Results with DoctorsVisualizationWhat is the network looking at?Refresh on Confusion MatricesConfusion MatrixConclusionIn this short section, we get a lot of practical ideas on working in deep learning.How to break into Deep Learning industry?It is important to look for opportunities and showcase your own skills!Developing additional skillsYou‚Äôd need to master many skills which aren‚Äôt present in this Nanodegree, here are some examples:What do typical deep learning engineers do in their day-to-dayJob-specific tasks differ from company to company, but here are some examples:This was the second part of Deep Learning Nanodegree.

IN SEARCH FOR ‚ÄúKNOWLEDGE‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/whats-the-most-real-thing-bcde3fd386ce,Tenzin Jampa,18,7,1116,"INTRODUCTIONAfter going through the Cartesian doubt of questioning the validity of everything that I observe and feel ( consciously or unconsciously, empirically or theoretically, a priori or a posterior), I came to the conclusion that the existence of ‚ÄúLogos‚Äù, a metaphysical term for ‚Äòreason‚Äô, is the most fundamental ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô that is neither subject to doubt nor change.Rene Descartes, the 17th-century mathematician/philosopher, was one of the most profound thinkers to question the validity and truthiness of everything from beliefs to ideas to thoughts to matter. He argued that our sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often unreliable and therefore should be highly doubted. For example, this world might be a simulation in a video game of a super intelligent being and the world we see, and the lives we live might be the source of entertainment for that being. He also pointed out how most of what we believe to be true is thought right without much analysis and rationality, varying significantly with respect to the time of your birth, place of your birth and the surrounding situation. For example, the things you believe while you are angry and calm is entirely different and therefore raises the question of ‚ÄúWhich one is true?‚Äù Now you might say that the things that the mad mind believes will not survive the test of rationality, then this raises the question of how can we be sure that there is no other mental state which is more rational and more true than our current state. This leads us to conclude that our belief is still subject to change and skepticism on its truthiness. Ergo our beliefs and ideas are also not ‚Äúknowledge.‚ÄùAs Descartes wrote in his opening lines of the Meditation I, 1964:Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to ridmyself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation.- Rene DescartesThis drove him to his fervent quest to search for ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù-a timeless fact that he won‚Äôt be able to doubt- which he could then employ as the first principle to build our understanding of the world as a bottom-up approach. The reason why I am introducing the Cartesian doubt is to showcase the context in which I, Descartes and other philosophers have searched for true ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù and I hope to relay my understandings and my progress in the following pages.www.datadriveninvestor.comWHAT DO I MEAN BY LOGIC/REASON?When I write about logic or reason here, I imply the ‚Äòprocess‚Äô by which we- unconsciously or consciously- either deductively or inductively conclude something from the premises stated. Reason is the most important thing we have. It is the mechanism by which we develop our implicit assumptions which we unconsciously act out in our life. It is also the means by which we tackle problems and solve them. By far, logic is the only language game that every one of us can play because we all follow the rules consciously or unconsciously. We just don‚Äôt realize it.LOGIC AND REASON AS ‚ÄòKNOWLEDGE‚ÄôI hope I have really steel-manned what I mean by ‚Äúreason‚Äù for what comes after follows from what I have established in the earlier paragraph. For me ‚ÄúReason/logic‚Äù is one of the ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù I have found. Because when I employed Cartesian doubt in questioning the validity of ‚ÄòReason/logic,‚Äô I realized that I was using the same mechanism which I had already assumed untrue to conclude that the mechanism is untrue and unjustified. In short, I was trying to use reason to prove reason is untrue. It does not take a philosophy degree to understand how contradictory both the statement and the exercise sounds and is. Once I realized that I could not doubt reason without assuming the validity of it, I started to see that reason or the process of reasoning as the one thing that I cannot doubt because if I started to doubt, I do it at the expense of losing the very meaning of ‚Äòdoubt.‚ÄôPOSSIBLE OBJECTIONSPremise 1: The position and the alignment of the astronomical bodies affect you.Premise 2: Astrology tells you how you change retrospectively to the changes in the alignment of the astronomical bodies.Premise 3: Science studies quantitative changes in one variable with respect to other variables.Conclusion: Therefore, Astrology is a science.If you have noticed here, the logic or rather the process of reasoning has no problem. The conclusion effectively follows from the premises laid out. In that case, I would say ‚ÄòLogos‚Äô still exists. Now, we deem people who believe in astrology as science as irrational because their premises are just not true. Another one..Premise 1: Lord Buddha knows everythingPremise 2: He does not lie.Premise 3: He said that our past deeds( karmic deeds of past lives) determine to a huge extent what we do and can do in this life.Conclusion: Past lives exist and the things we did then determine us now.Here again, the conclusion is a necessary outcome of the logic ensued from the premises.The process of reasoning-‚ÄòLogos‚Äô-still exist. Not saying the deduction is wrong or right, but the deductive reasoning is based on premises which we don‚Äôt know to be true as and is not agreed on by everyone. Therefore we deem it quite irrational. Here again, bad information and untrue premises is mistaken as irrationality.I think that we have no choice but to accept the reality of ‚ÄòLogos‚Äô for it is the mechanism by which we doubt. And if we start doubting these two things, we start to lose the very meaning of doubt which is the essence of the Cartesian skepticism. Starting to doubt Logos is the same as starting to doubt doubt. It‚Äôs self contradictory, paradoxical and leads to nowhere. Therefore, there is no way around it but to put a flag post on ‚ÄòReason/Logos‚Äô and establish it as the fundamental basis of reality. Therefore I have concluded in my own words ‚ÄúI doubt doubt when I doubt the Logos.‚ÄùI neither assume extraordinary knowledge nor pretend to have prodigious realizations through this paper. This paper is an attempt of mine to articulate and steel-man my thoughts and conclusions with Cartesian skepticism looming over me. In doing so, I have reached a momentary intellectual peak where I state ‚ÄúLogos‚Äù as the fundamental reality. I hope to find more through my journey. I am very much open to further arguments, reasons and evidences that may be contrary to what I have alluded through out my paper. Hope you enjoyed it.",18/07/2019,0,0,5,3,875,752,2,2,0,1,81
Women are not creative,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/women-are-not-creative-b90ca376c7a8,William Barter,987,6,1215,"Humans love myths.Without it, perhaps, it would be impossible to live in society. Almost everything that defines the structure of a human community is related to the concepts that shape our beliefs. A group to live well, at least in theory, must believe in the same ideas, the pillars that underpin the basis of their coexistence; they must accept the concepts that make the social balance: money, gods, private property, politics, education, etc.   Of course, this is all very beautiful when you see it written in a text. Because reality never resembles our imagination. I‚Äôm glad that is very true.‚ÄúYou will learn only the necessary,‚Äù said Marcela‚Äôs father. The girl, who studied at a college of nuns, could study, but there was a limit that should be respected. It was the nineteenth century, so maybe that was normal. In the movie, Elisa & Marcela, directed by Isabel Coixet, 2019, the plot drew my attention to female creativity. At that time (perhaps a long time ago before that), it was believed that women did not need many studies, because somehow it would be a waste of time since it would not do much good. Female creativity was a mystery. A dark one. So it was best to keep it locked behind a thick stone wall, able to contain that roar.  I know I can‚Äôt talk about women. It‚Äôs not my place of speech. Yes, a man has no authority to talk about the world of women. But, as a man, I can talk about the world of men, where was built that wall.The Women‚Äôs World Cup convinced me of something. It‚Äôs amazing to see how girls have evolved into their sporting art. The loveliest thing is to see how the scene does not look like the one we see every day in thousands of grassy rectangles all over the world. Males burning testosterone in combat, like gladiators, vying for control of a round object made of leather, which bears the logo of some famous brand. The initial courtesy, which is limited to a few handshakes and little smiles, quickly vanishes replaced by bumps and kicks. The game turns, and the rules almost lose their meaning.  I‚Äôm not saying that women play this sport better. I say only that, over time, they have overcome many limits, sophisticating their moves, and increasing their physical capacity and technique, without losing their tenderness. The game flows. There is no excess of complaints and violence, at least not for me.  Women‚Äôs creativity always existed but has always been censored. Today, social media helps connect this mass of people who find inspiration in the most varied sources. The Internet has helped break down barriers, creating a spirit of unity between them.The more doors open, the more feminine faces we see in the most different places. Credits for films, plays, books, and artistic productions. They are running more companies, political parties, cars, bicycles, classrooms, cities, states, and countries. Human beings who could only, in the very recent past, ‚Äúlearn only the necessary‚Äù. The more books they read, without any censorship, the richer the mindset of our society becomes. The absence of women in positions of authority, especially in sciences, only delayed the human journey.  They stayed too long serving only for filling in a society made of plush. They were there to support and give shape, but the merits and privileges, in the end, were outside.  It may seem tragic, I know, but even today, women are ridiculed, in many ways, for fighting for more equality.  While watching a PBS documentary about the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft sent to explore the planet Saturn, I was amazed by the number of women on the team who had been in charge of the project for 30 years. A stark contrast to that men-infested image of the Apollo mission control team. The more books, the more freedom. The more freedom, the more creativity roaming around, filling this world with ideas.We‚Äôve never seen so many women at the Oscars. It can improve, of course. But, we are in a direction that I consider very interesting.  Female creativity was stifled for millennia. Historically, since the caves, it has been believed that they look better when taking care of the home environment. Out of this scenario, the world is in danger, because the food will not be cleaned and cooked, making babies and males complain. Hence, hungry warriors are not able to defend the interests of the tribe. Feed your male and guarantee peace, would say some ‚Äúwise‚Äù old man.  Many writers had to use pseudonyms to be published. Even today, this can be seen. Some people still believe that J. K. Rowling is not a woman.   ‚ÄúAnd you, Helena Ferrante, are you a man too?!‚Äù The relationship between Elisa and Marcela in Spain at the end of the nineteenth century was very dangerous; so much that Elisa had to cross-dress like a man, assuming the identity of a dead cousin, to be able to marry Marcela. The film tells the true story of the first same-sex marriage made by the Catholic Church. Both suffered harsh penalties and paid high prices to defend a love that almost no one understood. Feminine creativity does not have to resemble masculine‚Äôs to be called creativity. Difficulties have helped in various ways to mobilize them, over time, to break down barriers, dodge rules, and find gaps to emancipate themselves. Many women have assumed the male perspective to open doors and create opportunities. But what really made the difference is that they found their originality as people, as human beings, showing what they really have, without copies or models. Human beings are creative, regardless of gender, when they are genuinely authentic. Men still seem to believe in the myth of the cave, when they were still responsible for the tribe‚Äôs hunting and safety. Things have changed. Women have proven they are open to novelty too, promoting incredible revolutions throughout history.That gave them more and more space in society, without their peers perceiving; because they were too busy fighting for the size of their obelisks.  Women are cooperative and think about the future. That alone is enough to destroy the foundations of any society that believes only in the pure and simple meritocracy, in the myth of the dominant genre, which is based only on what we can see, and the immediate results. Women are not creative: this is a myth! The more visibility they reach, the more they inspire other women around the world. The chain effect has revealed an increasing number of girls willing to show their potential without fear of criticism. With real freedom to learn, excellent sources to research, and appropriate encouragement, the history of female creativity is being radically changed. Of course, this is good for any human being. But for those who have suffered for millennia, under the myth of being fragile, incompetent, inferior, incomplete, and incapable, it has become the ideal fuel for creating new meanings capable of killing a totally unnecessary myth.‚Äî -Thank you so much for reading.If you like my work and want to support me then you can r buy me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏èor become a medium member by using this link.Keep following for more such stories!Schedule a DDIChat Session with William Barter at the link below.",18/07/2019,0,0,3,6,863,946,6,0,0,5,93
3rd Sparks Interview: Wu Xiao ‚Äî World‚Äôs First Cloud-based IDE for Project Libra,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/3rd-sparks-interview-wu-xiao-worlds-first-cloud-based-ide-for-project-libra-a8907826e5ed,X-Order,212,8,1584,"Wu Xiao, the founder of White Matrix and his team launched the world‚Äôs first cloud-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to access Libra Move, in bid to support Facebook‚Äôs new programming language ‚ÄòMove‚Äô for project Libra.Wu Xiao is the developer of ‚ÄúCell Evolution‚Äù (Champion DApp at Nebulas Incentive Program Season 1) and ‚ÄúLast Trip‚Äù on the Nebulas blockchain.www.datadriveninvestor.comHe is a Computer Science graduate at the University of Alberta, Canada and an executive member and Director at the Branch of the China Computer Federation. His paper ‚ÄúAn Interoperable Avatar Framework Across Multiple Games and Blockchains‚Äù was published during INFOCOM 2019, a prestigious Academic Conference on computer networks. He has also won the Game Creativity Award in the first NEO Game Development Competition.Q: Do you think Libra is different from other languages?There has been no huge innovation after Ethereum‚Äôs Solidity language.Before this, no one had thought of creating a new language for blockchain development.The fact that Facebook is willing to rebuild a language from its base indicates strongly that Facebook really wants to step into this field.The ‚ÄòMove‚Äù language has some C language features, such as pointers and classes. Some of its instructions also include copy and move, which optimizes smart contracts for blockchains, allowing you to write recursive statements.Q: If we only look at developing games on Libra, do you think it would be more convenient?Facebook has the first-mover advantage by being the first acclaimed global central bank.We can see that Libra‚Äôs ratings on Github have exceeded IBM Hyperledger‚Äôs three years of ratings in just one day.It has the potential to reach more users and developers than all public chains combined. This is largely due to the strength of its behemoth network and being open source, which crowdsources the world‚Äôs intelligence by having developers help maintain and write codes for it. Our team also helped them fix several bugs and submitted them.It will probably be faster than all the public blockchains we have now.Facebook has world-leading technical capabilities, so in many aspects (i.e. underlying technology, ecology, etc.) Libra is going to easily surpass any other existing public blockchains. Comparatively, Ethereum has more than 10,000 nodes (vs Libra‚Äôs 100 over nodes), which makes it very decentralized but very slow. Previously, all of these had been done in a decentralized manner without a proper team working on it systematically. Hence, I think Facebook can make a much better blockchain than before.More importantly, with its network it can bring in ordinary users.Q: What exactly is Facebook‚Äôs goal in issuing Libra?That‚Äôs what I think Facebook is ambitious about. The first batch of people to issue currency on Libra will certainly have an advantage.The key is to stabilize users and gain traffic.Previous developers are usually some early practitioners who make up 0.1% of the mainstream programmers. The people who were drawn in here this time are that 99.9%. They may have previously thought that blockchain was fraudulent or infeasible. This mindset may have changed with Facebook‚Äôs foray into blockchain.With the influx of programmers, the sum of the whole will be greater than its parts.Libra has relatively fewer but powerful nodes, the nodes themselves are big companies like Visa and Uber who provide complimentary servers and their intelligence. It can be said that what Facebook created has pushed the entire blockchain industry one step forward.Q: As of now, what are you planning to do on Libra?What we intend to do now is to unify IDEs in all areas of smart contracts. We believe that 99% of the chains will cease to exist in the future, and the majority of the developers will aggregate to the remaining 1%.As long as we can access this 1% now, then everything that we have accumulated, and all our contracts and developers can be transferred over.Most chains are willing to cooperate because we have traffic on Libra through ‚ÄòMove‚Äô. Thereafter, we should be creating access to user traffic, as well as debugging tools. We will also have some tutorials, such as how to write in ‚ÄòMove‚Äô, which we will teach through a game-based approach.Q: Your team used to make games, but now you are slowly turning into a company that services developers, somewhat similar to SaaS?We still make games, there will be three games released this year.We make IDE because it is useful and saves time for developers. At present, there is no Libra smart contract in China at all. While in other countries, Facebook is too proud to support Windows environment.Q: Why is the DNA being uploaded only after the death of the cells in Cell Evolution?Cell Evolution is the first decentralized strategy and sandbox game application built on the blockchain.In Cell Evolution, each player is a biological cell, which must balance adaptability, survivability, and fertility to grow and survive. The cell‚Äôs growth and data are dependent on the surrounding environment, including the evolution of other cells in the game, and is uploaded to the Nebulas blockchain accordingly. The destiny of the entire cell world is determined by the data of all players. If the balance of the cell population is disturbed, the entire ecosystem will be affected and fail to evolve. [Quoting Nebulas.io]This is a social game, where some players are like Thanos, who just wants to blow up the world. Some players want to develop in a way that is as balanced as possible.The same is true for the game ‚ÄòLast Trip‚Äô that we developed. The game itself is like flipping through a book. You can flip forward or backward constantly. One of its innovations is that after you die, you can become a character in the book, and your story will be written in the book.Imagine that the original book only has 300 pages, but after many players‚Äô choices influence the plot, the book increasingly becomes very rich in content. This is the thought process of blockchain technology.Q: Is the game logic difficult to be fully realized?The game itself still needs polishing. However, the idea is relatively more innovative, compared to games with pre-designed plots.We are emphasizing a social game where players can develop themselves. The game design does not entirely lie in the plot and media; but in how to build an open world, that reasonably allows everyone to participate, and come together to determine the path of the world and the content of the game.I think these innovations are very important, for example, the concept of ‚Äòconstantly increasing‚Äô. I was also inspired by blockchain to continuously add content, which can also be linked to the content that follows.Q: Then is it possible to create this game without blockchain?If you mean not using blockchain technology, then it is possible. However, one advantage of blockchain is that you can connect different games into common character data. You may have constructed a lot of buildings in one game, but it‚Äôs hard to use in other games because it‚Äôs a closed system. But in our game ‚ÄòLast Trip‚Äô, your character in TRON can be used to fight against other characters in Ethereum. It‚Äôs kind of like ‚ÄòReady Player One‚Äô, which connects certain character attributes to public events.Let‚Äôs think about whether some ecological logic behind the Internet is correct. Is a character in Tencent games possible to be shared with Netease, and vice-versa?In ‚ÄòReady Player One‚Äô, a small, motorcycle model in one planet can be taken out and converted into a carriage in another world. At this point, you will find that data connection, transparency, and mobility is very important. Tencent and Netease will never be able to do that.Let‚Äôs assume we have two games, and I would like them to be connected. This can be done easily as long as you write a smart contract in the middle, which allows the items you get in one game to be retrieved in the other game, but with the same attributes.However, I think that blockchain‚Äôs integration with games has not been fully discovered yet. It depends a lot on our imagination.Maybe it‚Äôs because the infrastructure is insufficient, or because the scale of users is not large enough for more developers to focus on doing this.Q: Many times, items or characters in the game must be placed in a specific scenario in order to maximize their value. That is to say, in the two cross-chain games, their backgrounds must be at least the same in the larger world. Yet, they have some very basic rules that are different. How do you resolve this problem?Just as there are different rules in different galaxies in ‚ÄòReady Player One‚Äô, there are unified rules for the different galaxies. You can imagine how interesting it is to do this in a single-player game. For example, in ‚ÄòThe Legend of Sword and Fairy‚Äô, characters in the first-gen has no connection with the second-gen.However, you‚Äôll feel great and connected to the past ‚Äòyou‚Äô if the same first-gen characters appeared in the second gen‚Äôs game. For example, saving the files of ‚ÄòThe Legend of Sword and Fairy I‚Äô and summoning the same characters with the same weapons in ‚ÄòThe Legend of Sword and Fairy II‚Äô.Q: Last question, why would you choose blockchain?If the reason you step into the blockchain industry is just to make some quick bucks, there‚Äôs no need to come here. I think there must be some ambition in working on blockchains, such as building a big business, wanting to defeat one or two giants, wanting to bring more value to developers and so on.I think one must at least possess some of these visions in order to be willing to work on blockchains.",18/07/2019,0,0,19,9,917,478,9,1,0,3,120
Will Artificial Intelligence and Robots Pay Off for Walmart? ‚Äî Market Mad House,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/will-artificial-intelligence-and-robots-pay-off-for-walmart-market-mad-house-4ce23393808f,Daniel G. Jennings,4000,8,1495,"Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is betting big on artificial intelligence and robots. Specifically, the retail giant is betting that customers will voluntarily submit to behavioral science experiments with artificial intelligence (AI).In fact, it converted a Long Island Walmart Neighborhood Market into a combination AI research lab and data center. Artificial intelligence monitors customer behavior, stock levels, and other factors through special cameras, Walmart admits in a press release.www.datadriveninvestor.comAI in the store; or Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL), can recognize products on shelves and compare quantities to sales, Walmart claims. Moreover, the AI tells associates which products they need to restock.‚ÄúThe focus will be on learning from the technology and not implementing changes to operations in haste,‚Äù Walmart writes of the IRL. Thus, Walmart is committing to AI for the long-haul.Artificial intelligence is not the only experimental technology Walmart is deploying in its stores.Walmart is putting thousands of robots on its sales floors, Big Think reports. For instance, robot janitors will clean floors, while simple robots will monitor stock levels.Meanwhile, Walmart is testing the ‚ÄúFAST Unloaders‚Äù an automated unloading conveyor system in 1,200 stores.The FAST Unloader is an automatic conveyor belt that moves boxes out of a truck and places them into carts. Associates take the carts to the carts to the proper location in the store. Interestingly, FAST‚Äôs manufacturer; Pulseroller, claims its system can direct merchandise to the proper location by reading a barcode.Walmart could further automate this system by using robotic carts that take the merchandise to the right location. For instance, FAST could load a cart with toys, and the car will drive to the toy department. Once in the department, an associate will unbox the merchandise and stock the shelves.Walmart‚Äôs management hopes to reduce labor costs, improve efficiency, speed operations, and reduce the risk of loss by automating stocking.Robotic stocking can reduce losses by reducing human errors and the possibility of employee theft. A robot is not likely to steal TV sets and sell them to a fence, for instance.I think automated stocking could add a lot of value to Walmart ‚Äî if it works. For example, Walmart could open more stores because of reduced labor costs. In addition, Walmart could open more stores in areas with high labor costs; like cities with a $15 minimum wage.Plus, Walmart could stock more merchandise and a greater variety of items. Importantly, Walmart could pass its saving onto customers in the form of lower prices to increase sales.Finally, automated stocking will help Walmart compete with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) by lowering prices and increasing variety and efficiency. Finally, Walmart could increase profits by doing less with more. Theoretically, Walmart could operate more stores and larger stores with fewer people with automated stocking.Stocking is not the only labor cost, Walmart is trying to cut. CNBC reports Walmart is trying to cut the size of management staffs.Given that revelation, one goal of the IRL could be to replace store managers with algorithms or AI. To explain, instead of a manager, an AI could tell Walmart associates what to do. The AI could tell associates what it to restock and what outdated products to remove.Walmart is taking a huge risk here because nobody knows how human associates will react to AI management. My guess is some associates could welcome AI management, after all the AI is probably smarter than many managers. Additionally, AI is unlikely to be racist, arrogant, corrupt, sexist, or nitpicking.Human managers often waste employees‚Äô time with micromanagement, nick picking, needless training, and useless advice. Thus, eliminating managers could make stores more efficient and improve employee morale.Oddly, finding or training good retailer managers is hard. I have seen signs promising a cash reward to people who refer experienced retail managers to open jobs in Dollar Tree Stores (NASDAQ: DLTR). Given the competition, Walmart wants to stop running a school for retail managers.Finally, a smaller staff could allow Walmart to increase wages and benefits. Thus, Walmart could hire only a few highly experienced and competent associates to run its stores. Like Costco (NASDAQ: COST) Walmart could pay extra for the best associates.Walmart is conducting a radical retail experiment that could be as disruptive as anything Amazon is doing. Consequently, Walmart is taking a huge risk investors need to understand.Under these circumstances, investors will ask if Walmart is making money. Generally, companies do not undertake radical experiments until management gets scared. Therefore, I think the situation scares Walmart‚Äôs management, a development that should frighten investors.Notably, Walmart reported its quarterly revenues fell for the first time in a year on 30 April 2019. To explain, Walmart reported quarterly revenues of $128.028 billion on 31 July 2018 and $138.783 billion on 1 January 2019. Yet, Walmart reported quarterly revenues of $123.925 billion on 30 April 2019.However, Walmart‚Äôs cost of revenues is falling which justifies the experiments with new technology. In detail, Walmart reported a $104.907 billion cost of revenue on 31 January 2019 that fell to $93.034 billion on April 30, 2019. Thus Walmart‚Äôs commitment to new technology and efficiency could pay off.Walmart is making less money from its business. For instance, Walmart reports a quarterly gross profit of $30.891 billion on April 30, 2019.That gross profit was down from $33.886 billion on 31 January 2019 and $30.383 billion on April 30, 2018. In addition, Walmart‚Äôs gross profit fell from $5.75 billion on 30 April 2018 and $6.057 billion on 31 January 2019 to $4.945 billion on 30 April 2019.Conversely, Walmart‚Äôs net income rose from $2.134 billion on 30 April 2018; and $3.697 billion on 31 January 2019, to $3.842 billion on 30 April 2019. Thus, Walmart is making less money, but keeping a little more of the money it makes.Perhaps these numbers indicate Walmart is getting more efficient. On the other hand, that efficiency could be too little to reverse Walmart‚Äôs revenue slump.Ominously, Walmart‚Äôs business is generating less cash. Specifically, Walmart‚Äôs free cash flow fell from $3.541 billion in April 2018 to $1.4 billion in April 2019. Additionally, Walmart‚Äôs operating cash flow fell from $6.213 billion in April 2018 to $6.213 billion in April 2019.Oddly, Walmart‚Äôs revenues grew by 1.01% in the quarter ending on 30 April 2019. I think rising revenues and a falling cash flow shows, Walmart has to spend more money to sell merchandise. Thus, Walmart‚Äôs expenses could be increasing.The push for AI management, automated stocking, and robotics is a justifiable effort given the cash flow drop at Walmart. Simply put, Walmart needs to get far more efficient, quickly, if it wants to survive.In particular, Walmart‚Äôs management wants to maintain the company‚Äôs vast US footprint of 4,769 stores with a smaller staff. Additionally, management wants to preserve Walmart‚Äôs historically low prices; which are its greatest advantage in the retail wars.Notably, competitors like Kroger (NYSE: KR); America‚Äôs second-largest grocer, Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), and Amazon are enhancing their capabilities. Kroger, for example, plans to open 20 robotic fulfillment centers across the US with help from the British company Ocado Group PLC (LON: OCDO), Data Driven Investor reports.Significantly, I recently bought a bottle of 100 Xtra Strength Bayer Aspirins that normally sells for $13 for $3.39 at Walgreens. Thus, Walgreens is mimicking Walmart‚Äôs deep-discounting strategy.These developments could force Walmart to make expensive investments in risky technologies and new infrastructure to remain competitive. In particular, growing competition could force Walmart to open hundreds of new smaller locations with expensive automated stocking systems to counter low prices at Walgreens.Thus, Walmart could spend vast amounts of money to remain competitive; in addition, to the billions it will need to invest in same-day delivery infrastructure. Consequently, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) could be a far riskier investment than many people think.Significantly, Walmart‚Äôs liquid assets are smaller than you might assume. On April 30, 2019, for instance, Walmart had no short-term investments. However, Walmart had $9.255 billion in cash and equivalents on that day.On the other hand, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) had $37.027 in liquid assets on 31 March 2019. Specifically, Amazon reported $23.115 billion in cash and equivalents and $13.905 billion in short-term investments at the end of March.Walmart has a lot of cash, but its biggest competitor has nearly four times more cash. That alone will make it difficult for Walmart to compete.Given the realities, and financial numbers I think Mr. Market overvalued Walmart at $114.16 a share on 18 July 2019.However, I concede Walmart is still a good dividend stock that will pay 53‚Çµ a share on 3 September 2019. Moreover, Walmart‚Äôs dividend grew by 1‚Çµ in 2019, the company a 52‚Çµ dividend on 2 January 2019 and 53‚Çµ on 1 April 2019.Impressively, Walmart is continuing 44 years of dividend growth, Dividend.com reports. Plus, Walmart shares offered investors a dividend yield of 1.85%, an annualized payout of $2.12, and a payout ratio of 44.1% on 18 July 2019.In conclusion, Walmart is still a good dividend stock, but the company is taking serious risks. Investors need to be careful with Walmart because of the bets with technology its management is making.Originally published at https://marketmadhouse.com on July 18, 2019.",19/07/2019,0,0,9,5,790,453,10,0,0,10,113
How to make your container wrangling more efficient with Rancher Labs managed K8s platform‚Ä¶,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-to-make-your-container-wrangling-more-efficient-with-rancher-labs-managed-k8s-platform-65b009dd97cb,James David Bohrman,39,4,651,"As a technology, Kubernetes has now seen largely widespread adoption throughout a variety of industries. Obviously much of this adoption was driven by the early adopters on the back-end of the technological ‚ÄúS-curve‚Äù. However, at this point, many large players have embraced Kubernetes as a technology and a leader in the container orchestration field.Being on the back-end of the S-curve, many of the early adopters were the users who dabbled in K8‚Äôs before the ecosystem had things like Helm or Operators to make setting up Kubernetes easier. Part of this is to be expected for any technology to be adopted, however, we are now seeing much broader adoption of Kubernetes and with that a greater demand on expectations such as the ease of use. With this comes a range of managed solutions such as Rancher!Managed solutions basically take the legwork out of spinning up K8‚Äôs infrastructure. You still have the ability to customize it how you want, and full kubectl control, but Rancher basically handles things such as TLS certificate provisioning.Are managed solutions for everyone? Probably not, but for those who have tried, writing Kubernetes manifests in YAML is unforgiving if you get it wrong. With Rancher, you benefit from Kubernetes immediately, without worrying about YAML. There is something to be said for leaving the tedious aspect of YAML writing to a solution as opposed to doing it yourself.Also, Rancher is perfect for a multi-cloud architecture. Rancher not only deploys Kubernetes clusters anywhere, on any provider, but it also unites them under centralized authentication and access control. For companies that rely on uptime and availability, this can be a godsend.Now I‚Äôm going to take you all through a little demo of what it takes to spin up Rancher with Docker and with the Rancher UI can do.After installing Docker, enter this command to spin up a Rancher container:To access the Rancher server UI, open a browser and go to the hostname or address where the container was installed. You will be guided through setting up your first cluster.It should look like this:After you setup your admin password and run through the initial set up steps, you will be guided to the clusters page:Here you will be able to either provision your K8‚Äôs resources via four options:You will need to create a service account in GCP by importing a JSON private key, information on doing this can be found in the docs here. You also might need to enable some API‚Äôs before getting started.After all this, you‚Äôll see your cluster provisioned at the clusters page and if you click the displayed cluster you‚Äôll be brought to a page that looks like this:Here you can do a variety of things:If you navigate over to the nodes page, you‚Äôll be greeted by a page that shows your nodes, with the GUI options to cordon and drain if need be:Next head over to the Security tab and take a look at some of the features Rancher has to offer. Rancher gives users a centralized authentication solution for all their Kubernetes clusters and users. Users can connect to any cluster with one set of credentials using the authentication service of their choice.Here‚Äôs what the GUI looks like for the security tab:And the Authentication tab:So now that we‚Äôve shown you all that stuff, we can go back to the clusters section and start using the in-browser kubectl console. Go ahead and install some Helm charts or Operators to get a feel for how it works while you watch the resources spin up on your desired infrastructure.With that, I‚Äôve pretty much given you the basics of spinning up infrastructure with Rancher.

Idempotent Reviews,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/idempotent-reviews-3ef74867f070,Aviv Ben-Yosef,1000,3,235,"R&D organizations nowadays have lots of different types of reviews, appraisals, evaluations, and assessments. It starts with the low-level code-reviews (commonly known as ‚Äúpull requests‚Äù more often than not), reaches higher technical aspects such as The Architecture Review (capitalized, of course) and even performance reviews. These reviews are not meant to be treated like reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

The Art of Pitching: How I Got Published in The Atlantic,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-art-of-pitching-how-i-got-published-in-the-atlantic-b068e8e3e406,Michael Thomas,651,11,2449,"Over the last two years, I‚Äôve written for national magazines like The Atlantic, FastCompany, and Quartz. In this piece, I‚Äôve broken down the process I used to break into these publications. My hope is that it will help you get your ideas published and build your personal or company brand.Two years ago, I returned to my hometown of Denver after five years away. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone except my family that I‚Äôd returned, and for the next two weeks I holed up at my parents‚Äô house. No, I wasn‚Äôt another discouraged millennial moving back into the basement ‚Äî I simply decided it was time to achieve a childhood dream and get published in a national magazine.During those two weeks, I did nothing but read books and write magazine pitches. I told myself that I wouldn‚Äôt leave until one of my pitches was accepted. Over the course of 14 days I sent 14 pitches, and finally, on August 9 my first story was accepted by Quartz. A couple of weeks later my second story was accepted by The Atlantic. Then I landed another story with Quartz. A couple of months later I started contributing to FastCompany regularly.What inspired this crazy routine? To put it simply I wanted to share my ideas and experiences with millions of people. For years I had written blog posts about what I was learning as an entrepreneur. On average hundreds of people would read them ‚Äî maybe thousands if I was lucky. I knew that if I wanted to build a personal brand and generate awareness for my company I‚Äôd need to get my ideas in front of a larger audience.In hindsight, the path to success was relatively straightforward. The only thing that prevented me from doing so in the first place was myself. Self-doubt and the notion that only ‚Äúreal writers‚Äù could write for major magazines stopped me from taking the first step.Once I overcame my doubts and learned the process of pitching I started getting published in national magazines. With the prestige associated with names like The Atlantic, I had the opportunity to meet with the founders of companies like Kickstarter. My stories started hitting the front page of Reddit and HackerNews. Last summer I achieved my goal and passed one million cumulative views on my stories.Below I‚Äôve outlined the exact steps and resources that I use to get published. My hope is that it will help you build your brand and get your own stories in front of millions of people.Every profession or skill has its own element of ‚Äúinsider‚Äôs baseball.‚Äù In the publishing industry, there‚Äôs a proper way to pitch stories. To learn this, I started reading articles on how to pitch. At first, all I found were fluff pieces and light blog posts sharing truisms that told me what I already knew: ‚ÄúKeep it short, and tell a good story.‚Äù That was no help. What I needed was the exact formula and set of actionable steps to get editors to respond.In one of the fluffy articles I read, I saw a link to a pitch database called The Open Notebook. There I found a list of about 100 successful magazine pitches next to the published story that they became. It was an incredible find.Before finding The Open Notebook, I hardly knew how to structure a pitch. Sometimes I sent entire stories. (Note: Never do this). Other times I sent something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to write a story about artificial intelligence. Are you interested?‚Äù (Why I thought this was a good idea, I‚Äôm not sure.)The Open Notebook enabled me to analyze the best practices of 100 successful pitches by some of my favorite writers. My number one takeaway was how to create a character-driven story hook.One of the things that surprised me the most was how beautifully written some of the pitches were. They included characters, plots, and everything else that a real story has. In other words, the core of the pitch was storytelling. In hindsight, that seems obvious, but at the time it was a revelation. I thought a pitch had to be formal and short. I learned that it should be a shortened version of the story that I‚Äôd eventually write.Here‚Äôs an excerpt of a successful pitch that I wrote using that framework:Over the course of 550 days, Casey Neistat became one of the Internet‚Äôs most famous celebrities. His daily vlog became one of the most popular and talked about channels on YouTube, attracting 6 million subscribers. He won GQ‚Äôs New Media Star award in 2016, produced one of the year‚Äôs most viral videos, and then crashed the Oscars. Then on November 19th he shocked the YouTube community that adores him so much and announced the end of his vlog.In the first decade of his career, Neistat straddled the line between filmmaking‚Äôs established world and its less critically respected fringe. As soon as he achieved commercial success, premiering films at Sundance and selling a TV series to HBO, he pivoted. Over the next five years he straddled the line between the filmmaking world and tech. By 2014 he was spending all of his time producing viral hits like the video of him snowboarding in New York City. The next year he started a Snapchat competitor, Beme, which he sold for $25 million at the end of 2016. Each time the world expects Neistat to do one thing, he does the exact opposite and achieves wild success.In his latest pivot Neistat wants to use his influence and filmmaking skills to make the world better. It‚Äôs cliche, he admits, but the man who achieved Internet fame by preaching platitudes like ‚ÄúDo what you love‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry what others think‚Äù has never shied away from the borderline trite. Up until now, Neistat hasn‚Äôt shared his plans. He has said repeatedly that he is excited about the democratization of technology, but how he‚Äôll contribute is unclear. Neistat has agreed to speak with me to share some of his plans.In this pitch, I was able to hook the editor with a question: why did Neistat end his vlog? Rather than answer it in a sentence I provided more character development, sharing snippets from his career. The pitch also had inherent conflict that appeals to FastCompany‚Äôs audience (between the established media world and the independent creator movement). The pitch ended with a larger question: what will this character (Neistat) do next? In other words, the pitch had every element of a good story: characters, plot, and meaning.I learned much of what I know about storytelling a couple of years ago from a video interview with This American Life‚Äôs Ira Glass.One of the most important elements of a good story is meaning. You can tell a story in which a character does something (plot) in a place (setting). But without meaning, it‚Äôs going to fall flat like a bad joke. In fact, comedy is a great place to learn how to tell stories.Andrew Stanton, writer/director of Toy Story, explains this brilliantly in his TED Talk on storytelling. He gives the following example:A tourist is backpacking through the highlands of Scotland, and he stops at a pub to get a drink. And the only people in there are a bartender and an old man nursing a beer. And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes, ‚ÄúYou see this bar? I built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county. Gave it more love and care than my own child. But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No.‚ÄùHe points out the window. ‚ÄúYou see that stone wall out there? I built that stone wall with my bare hands. Found every stone, placed them through the rain and the cold. But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No.‚ÄùHe points out the window. ‚ÄúYou see that pier on the lake out there? I built that pier with my bare hands. Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank. But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No. But you fuck one goat‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe old man at the bar describes three events ‚Äî things that he‚Äôs done in his town. Then he hooks us by suggesting that he has a nickname. By the third event we‚Äôre invested in the story and curious what his nickname is. I assume I don‚Äôt need to explain what the ‚ÄòAha! moment‚Äô in this story is. But the point is that every event in that story led to it.Every magazine pitch needs its own Aha! moment. It needs that moment where you go, ‚ÄúOh man, that explains why‚Ä¶‚Äù In telling a story you often need to engage in discussion around a larger event or trend, while connecting it to a truly interesting narrative.One day, soon after returning to Denver, I randomly read about how America controls a majority of the airplane manufacturing industry. I wanted to know how and why so many prominent airlines were started here and what entrepreneurs like myself could learn from it. In my research, I found an amazing story about how Bill Boeing started Boeing and United Airlines and launched the entire aviation industry as we know it.Unfortunately, a great story isn‚Äôt the only prerequisite to getting published. Timing and relevance to the news cycle is another essential ingredient. Here are the first two paragraphs from a pitch that led to one of my stories in The Atlantic to show you what I mean:On Saturday SpaceX will send a communications satellite by the name of Amos-6 into space. The launch will be the company‚Äôs 33rd and it is just one of 40 that SpaceX has planned in the coming years.30 years ago, a private company shuttling more satellites into space than NASA would have seemed crazy to all but a few in the aerospace industry. By the 1990s space travel seemed a distant dream shelved by governments overwhelmed by swelling deficits. Today, the dream of visiting far off planets is alive again though, thanks to private companies like SpaceX.Notice that I don‚Äôt even mention Bill Boeing or the aviation industry in the first two paragraphs? Instead, I found an event that could make the story relevant to the day‚Äôs news. That answered the question ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù and created a timely reason for telling a history of aviation in America.The next day Amos-6 exploded on the launch pad and my story suddenly became even more relevant. Hours after the explosion I followed up with the editor. He responded immediately and I landed the story.Before writing for magazines I avoided daily news like the plague. As an entrepreneur, I found it full of noisy distractions. But in deconstructing the pitch process I learned how important it is to have a finger on the pulse of current events.To really understand that idea put yourself in an editor‚Äôs shoes for a second. You get 30‚Äì50 email pitches every day, and you have a boss breathing down your neck asking when the next viral story is coming. You have endless deadlines, hotshot reporters to manage, and a constantly shifting 24-7 global news cycle. Sound easy?Prior to my first couple of pitches, I didn‚Äôt take an editor‚Äôs interests into consideration. I was thinking about the pitch from my perspective ‚Äî instead of thinking about it from theirs. Not thinking from the decision-maker‚Äôs perspective is a key mistake that people make in every facet of life, from sales to job interviews. It really hit home for me when I received the following email from an editor after I pitched a story about how corrupt the early airline industry was:Thanks so much for your pitch and sorry for the delay in getting back to you. This sounds like a great story but in the absence of interesting ‚Äòso-what‚Äô style lessons or implications, I‚Äôm going to pass. Let me know if you think I am missing something.The key to pitching is always asking ‚ÄúSo what? And who cares?‚Äù Your editor certainly will.Once I thoroughly learned the structure of the magazine pitch and got feedback from a few editors, I felt a new confidence. After sending my first pitch and receiving a rejection, I asked for feedback. The editor ‚Äî a writer that I really respect ‚Äî told me that he really liked the pitch, but it wasn‚Äôt relevant to his audience. That response and other words of encouragement prompted me to start sending pitches every day.Holed up in my parents‚Äô house, I was able to create an entirely new schedule for myself.As someone who used to be in sales, I knew the power of tracking my pipeline. That‚Äôs where the idea for a pitch tracker came from. Each day I‚Äôd log my pitches, and when I heard back I‚Äôd update them. Simply seeing the pitches logged in a spreadsheet forced me to pitch every day and track my progress. And I knew if I missed a day, then I‚Äôd feel that same anxiety that woke me up in Iceland.I won‚Äôt write more about routine since I think this has been covered a lot already. But the long and short of it is this: pitch every day, work hard, and be persistent. It took me seven pitches before I got my first story accepted.Of course, I‚Äôd be remiss to not mention the importance of one last thing in the pitch process, which is that good pitching is also about writing well. I‚Äôve already mentioned that storytelling is the core of any pitch. But so is good grammar and sentence structure. Your prose needs to be as readable as your stories are engaging. Of course, that is something that only comes with practice. There is no shortcut, no easy hack, to writing well. But fortunately, there are about ten bazillion books on the subject. On Writing Well by William Zinsser is a particularly great one. John McPhee‚Äôs Writing Life Archive is equally brilliant (and free).Another way to learn how to write well is simply by reading more. Every morning I read for about an hour. Every night I read for about 30 minutes before going to sleep. When I sit down to write I hear other, more experienced, authors‚Äô voices in my head. If a sentence isn‚Äôt grammatically correct I don‚Äôt notice it because I know all the rules of the English language. I notice because it doesn‚Äôt look like Michael Lewis‚Äô writing or a story in The New Yorker. The way I see it, every time I sit down to read, my brain slowly unravels the English language. Then, when I go to write, it references that information.",18/07/2019,10,0,0,0,1050,700,1,1,0,7,1000
How to Live Intentionally in the 21st Century: An Experiment,Better Humans,https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-live-intentionally-in-the-21st-century-44f40d93a305,Lydia Antonivna Lutsyshyna,75,13,2171,"We‚Äôve all been there: lying in bed in our silky pajamas, with morning breath and bedhead, mindlessly checking our phones. Perhaps it feels harmless to reply to that email from your boss or your professor while waking up‚Ä¶ but is it? Isn‚Äôt it actually a little odd to be spending such an intimate moment addressing your professional life?Of course, modern technology has made our lives easier in so many ways. However, just because we can travel faster, access information instantly, and communicate at any time does not mean that society lets us off the hook to spend our saved time relaxing.Instead, the expectations for our productivity simply increase in proportion to our improved technology. You can get there faster? Great, get there faster. You can access any information? Great, now you‚Äôre responsible for all of it. You can communicate anytime? Great, be available all the time. Such demands are so ubiquitous that one must take a step back to realize they are unnatural, and that modern life quietly violates our boundaries. We must be vigilant and reclaim our lives.In an effort to do just that, I ran my own experiment to track what happened in my life if I set a simple boundary around where I did my work. The results showed that setting this single constraint had a positive aspect on my life in several ways. And it set into motion a new paradigm for how I lived in general.In my junior year of college, I took a class with psychology professor Allen Neuringer, a well-known self-experimenter. Allen has been conducting experiments on himself for years, taking a special interest in how his thinking improves while walking outside instead of sitting inside. He believes that people benefit from studying their own behavior. ‚ÄúImagine that,‚Äù Allen exclaimed, ‚Äú‚Ä¶being able to walk up to anyone on the street and already have something to talk about: ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs your data?‚Äô‚ÄùOne major assignment of the class was to run a controlled, scientific self-experiment on ourselves. I struggled to think of a project, then I remembered an anecdote Allen told us in class about his old professor at Harvard, the famous B.F. Skinner.B.F. Skinner was a highly influential 20th-century American psychologist, best known for his contributions to behaviorism and research on operant conditioning. Behaviorism is an approach to psychology which involves observable actions rather than internal thoughts. Operant conditioning falls within this approach and refers to the control of behavior through consequences. For example, you may have heard of lab rats pressing levers for food pellets. This paradigm is a prime example of operant conditioning. The action of pressing the lever results in food, which is reinforcing, so the rat becomes more likely to repeat the behavior.Now, let‚Äôs say the lever press only produces a pellet when a light is on. This light would then be called a discriminative stimulus. In other words, the light sets the stage for the event of food. Solidifying these associations is known as establishing contextual control over behavior.Not only did Skinner test these principles of rats, but he also applied them to his own life. Allen told us about Skinner‚Äôs legendary chair. At his work desk, the professor used a special chair that was hooked up to a lamp. When he sat down, the light would turn on, much like the light in the rat cage signaling the availability of food. Instead of indicating the opportunity for banana pellets, Skinner‚Äôs light meant it was time to work, and only work. Could Skinner daydream, or chat, or relax throughout his day? Of course, he could ‚Äî but not in that chair. The effect was profound: by only working in that chair, B.F. Skinner established contextual control over his behavior, creating a strong association between focused work and the chair-light-combination. ‚ÄúSkinner claims that with his setup he could get done in 2 hours what would take another man 8,‚Äù Allen told our class.I thought, ‚ÄúHey, I could try this.‚ÄùWhen I was in college last year, my work-life balance was not ideal. I would find myself procrastinating essays until I would finally grit my teeth and pound out an assignment at midnight after stressing over it all evening. I would spend my free time in guilty limbo, thinking ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt work right now, then I don‚Äôt deserve to do anything fun.‚Äù I would then proceed to do neither, and simply half-nap, or scroll on my phone, or be around friends stewing in anxiety instead of being present. In that time, I could have watched two movies or made a painting! Instead, I just felt uncomfortable, in between, unable to commit to any activity. I found myself in denial of all the time I was spending like this. I had to try something like the desk.I decided to track various aspects of my life while only making a single change: doing homework only at a desk in the library at school.Working at home was probably so difficult in part because so many associations already existed at my house. The bed was already for sleeping; the kitchen table was already for eating; the living room couch was already for chatting with friends. However, the library was already for working, and it proved to be a reinforcing environment for working. I didn‚Äôt want other students to see me scrolling through social media! Look at everyone working so hard. Back to the dense French literature pdf‚Ä¶ plus, the school was full of built-in reinforcements for homework, like printers or available professors.Below, you can take a look at my simple tracking chart, which includes the date, hours of sleep/time awake, number of meals a day, hours spent on homework, and fun activities I did that day. The first row, ‚ÄúBaseline‚Äù, is my estimate of these measures before the start of the experiment. Weekends and spring break were excluded.My results really surprised me ‚Äî doing homework at school not only granted me free time for fun activities at home, but it also balanced my eating and sleeping habits! The amelioration of my physical health, no doubt, played into a positive feedback loop: when I felt good, I was probably more effective at the work I did.Because I wanted to come home as soon as possible after school (but knew once I did, I could not do homework) I started doing my homework in the mornings. This led me to wake up earlier. When I woke up earlier, I would want coffee. Since I would have time to buy one, I would usually grab breakfast then, too. Thus, indirectly due to my self-imposed rule of ‚Äúno homework at home,‚Äù I started waking up earlier and eating breakfast (which I used to skip). Then, when I would arrive home, I could truly relax and have fun, which led to more activities. I was able to fully enjoy my social time, unriddled by anxiety.It was as though making one small variation led to a domino effect of beneficial changes. I had to make accommodations for each aspect of my life, and those accommodations reinforced each other. School became a place where I was really at school, and home became a place where I was really at home.I also noticed that my workload was like a liquid: just as water would fill any container in its shape, my homework would fill whatever time block I had. If I had 2 hours, it would take 2 hours. If I had 4, it would take 4. The quality would be the same; I would just be on my phone quite a bit more if I had 4 hours. To maximize my free time, I got it down to an art. Through trial-and-error, I learned how long certain assignments would take so that I could complete them with maximum efficiency. Needless to say, I had a successful yet fun semester.I also presented the results of my experiment in a ‚ÄúShow & Tell‚Äù talk at the 2018 Quantified Self Conference:The really great thing about this method is that you only need to change one small thing (and stick to it!) to see significant results in several parts of your life.If you find that your manipulation is not working, or working too slowly, or is too difficult to actually stick to, don‚Äôt worry! You might be working on an issue too large; break it down. Try changing your associations. Try changing your rules. Remember, sometimes an environment will do the work for you (like the school library was already full of associations I needed). It‚Äôs no wonder artists and musicians have designated studios where they create their pieces. Figure out the perfect situation for your task, and then make that situation.The summer after my self-experiment, I decided that I wanted to carry this out further and live ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù. After studying psychology for years, I had learned a lot, but these 3 points stuck out to me:In other words, we go through a lot of life on auto-pilot, but we can choose to pay attention and make more conscious decisions. This kind of self-awareness takes practice. However, the easiest way to start is not by controlling your thoughts, but by controlling your environment. We are much more used to making external rather than internal changes. Luckily, as the third point states, there is less of a difference between these two than we might think. Our environment holds a massive influence over our mood and cognition.Here are the ways I learned to manage the environment around‚Äîand within‚Äîme, to help reinforce this goal of living intentionally.There‚Äôs nothing like a messy room to keep you stuck in unfulfilling patterns. In the same way that work can keep us from enjoying our free time, so can our own homes, if unmaintained. I‚Äôve definitely found myself unable to get up in the morning if there are piles of clothes on the ground, simply because I do not have the energy to deal with that issue. Like with homework, I feel too guilty to do anything else, so I do nothing. For anyone with mental health issues similar to mine, I am sure this scenario is quite relatable. Whatever piles up in your physical world will also pile up in your mental world, preventing you from relaxing and enjoying your day.To deal with my physical space, I have (over time) set the following habits:These tactics could be applied to your room, house, office, or even your car. Everyone has a different standard of cleanliness, so cater to your own needs! All of this article is really just meant as a starting place for you to develop what works for you. I am sure many others could be developed based on personal values for physical spaces.Increasingly, virtual space becomes a larger part of our lives. For me, knowing that my phone or laptop is a mess tenses me in the same way as physical space would. Depending on your personal sensitivity to this kind of clutter, the devices you own, and what you use them for, your own method will differ from mine. Here is what I‚Äôve found useful:Our free time never feels free because there is always something we could be doing, especially online. Consider developing an etiquette around technology that serves you. Where does work end, and home begin? Where does real end, and virtual begin? If you don‚Äôt choose, culture will choose for you. Without your consent, it will draw those boundaries. Luckily, with careful attention, you can take back those boundaries.As I mentioned, thoughts often prove harder to wrangle than our personal environments. Nevertheless, I find that writing out my thoughts can declutter my mind. I keep a collection of moleskin journals for different purposes.Depending on your personal level of organization needs, you may not need such a rigorous system. Conversely, you may want even more notebooks! I have certain friends who prefer online notes or Google Calendar. Your worries and responsibilities will still be there (in writing) when you‚Äôre done having fun. Just have fun, and deal with them when it‚Äôs time.If you decide to run your own experiment on setting boundaries with your time or implement some of the suggestions that have helped me do that, I cannot stress enough: pace yourself! This kind of thinking may help you consider how you want to maximize your own time and energy.Another secret? If you don‚Äôt want to do something, don‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôll do it faster (and actually have a good time!) when you want to do it. Saying no and taking care of your body will also improve, well, everything.Since I have committed myself to living intentionally, I feel more present in whatever I am doing, I can complete work faster, my spaces stay incredibly clean, I feel no guilt when taking time for myself, and I have plenty of time for social and creative pursuits! Before I made an effort to change my habits, I was often stressed and felt ‚Äúin between‚Äù activities.Best of luck, and I hope you see some amazing changes in your own life!",18/07/2019,5,0,5,9,823,911,3,5,0,1,877

On the other hand, content marketing is an excellent way to educate and engage your target audience about your product.On the surface, social media marketing and content marketing are two different strategies. Many companies even have different teams handling these initiatives.But if you look closely, social media and content marketing always work in tandem. That‚Äôs because they complement each other well. To make the most out of your marketing strategy, you need to align your social media and content marketing efforts. I interviewed Alan See about how all this works.Here‚Äôs what he had to say.Before we get started, let me say that it‚Äôs not difficult at all to align your social media and content marketing strategies. But it does require some advance planning.Here are some things you need to keep in mind to align your social media and content marketing plans.The words and the tone that you use to communicate with consumers shape your brand personality. Your brand voice is a big factor in determining your public perception.In a nutshell, your brand voice is how you manifest your core brand values into public communication. Because it represents your brand‚Äôs digital identity, it‚Äôs important to maintain a consistent brand voice across all communication channels.To find your unique brand voice, you need to look at your target audience and how they communicate.For instance, if your audience base is mostly corporate professionals, it‚Äôs advisable to use a professional tone. Or if it‚Äôs millennials, you need to be able to use millennial lingo. Basically, it‚Äôs about increasing relatability with your audience.If you have different teams handle your website content and social media channels, you need to keep them on the same page. Create a style guide that outlines the dos and don‚Äôts.DiGiornio believes in keeping their brand tone casual and loves to add some humor to their content. As you can see in the screenshot below, their style stays consistent across their website and Twitter handle.Producing content for your website takes a lot of time and effort. You need to understand that not all of your website visitors will read your content. Only a fraction of your visitors will engage with your content. And even a smaller percentage will actually convert.There is a good chance you may not get to see them again. That‚Äôs where retargeting comes in. Through retargeting, you can reach out to consumers who have previously visited your website.They‚Äôre already familiar with your products and brand. So you can tailor your messages in such a way that your content drives them to the next stage of the sales funnel.But how can you target tailored content to a specific audience?Using Facebook, you can find out which users have read a particular blog post. Based on those insights, you can micro-target those users for specific campaigns.In the screenshot below, Expedia is clearly targeting users who have previously looked for last minute flight deals. Or they are possibly targeting users who have clicked on an article that is related to last-minute travel plans.Social media is a very visual medium. That means you can get creative with the kind of content you publish. Videos, memes, GIFs, infographics, and podcasts are some examples of the types of content you can experiment with.Creating fresh, high-quality content takes a lot of time and effort. But there‚Äôs a smart shortcut you can use to produce more content. You can repurpose your content.Simply put, this means taking your existing content and changing the format in which you present it. For instance, you can design an infographic with the statistics from your blog post. Or you could take the gist of the topic and spin into a meme.For inspiration, take a look at Moz‚Äôs YouTube channel. Every Friday, they publish informational videos for their ‚ÄúWhiteboard Friday‚Äù video series. In all of their recent posts, they have given a link to a related blog post.Similarly, in their blog posts, you can read a detailed transcription of the video. They‚Äôre presenting the same information in both text and video formats. By doing this, they provide their audience the option to pick between two different ways of consuming content.To redirect your website traffic to social media or vice-versa, you need to link your site and social media handles. On your website, add social media buttons in a location where users can spot them easily. It is recommended to place them on the top right-hand section of your site.In addition to this, you should add a link to your website on all of your social media handles. Linking your site and social media handles can increase your brand awareness and visibility. It also makes it easier for potential customers to find more information related to your brand.Similarly, add social sharing buttons to your emails. This can help you build your social media presence and get more leads. And, best of all, it‚Äôs a simple tactic that doesn‚Äôt require much effort.Your social media strategy and content marketing plan aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Both are content-centric and are aimed at spreading the word about your brand. So it‚Äôs obvious that they will overlap.If you want to amplify your marketing efforts, you need to make sure your social media and content marketing plans work in-sync. I hope the strategies mentioned above help you align your social media and content marketing plans.In what other ways do you integrate social media into your content marketing efforts? Please share your insights in the comments section.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,8,638,443,5,0,0,8,206
Healthcare For All: From From Buzzwords to Realism,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/buzzwords-to-realism-the-fundamental-necessity-to-institute-quality-healthcare-for-everyone-9eb7022f17e3,Dr. ADAM TABRIZ,813,10,2345,"Direct primary care, Medicare-for-all, affordable care act (ACA), and universal healthcare are some of the thousand buzzwords floating around within the current healthcare planetary. In fact, in most cases, the resentment and hostility associated with their enthusiasts are much more robust to the point beyond proportion than what they may individually represent.‚ÄúTHE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF MAKING PEOPLE ACCEPT THE VALIDITY OF THE HEALTHCARE VALUES OR CONCEPT THEY ARE TO SERVE IS TO PERSUADE THEM THAT THEY ARE THE SAME AS THOSE THEY HAVE ALWAYS HELD, BUT WHICH WERE NOT PROPERLY RECOGNIZED BEFORE‚Äùwww.datadriveninvestor.comTherefore, I intend to shed an open-minded light on the dark side of today's medical culture. The ultimate pragmatism may only be through making healthcare coverage for all in the short run and quality medical care for every individual in the distant future.For those who have reached this far in my narrative, I must highlight if you are convinced that the only way we can ensure quality healthcare for all is through government intervention. Or at the other extreme, they believe that boycotting the insurance industry and government-run programs is the ultimate solution. Reading the rest of this chronicle will probably fail to convince you of the alternative options. Rest assured, there is no one silver bullet for the new world healthcare crisis we live through. Still, undoubtedly sundry realistic and Practical approaches exist to build a practical tool and implement the necessary strategies to simulate one.We must Entertain Options.The option is the most imperative attribute of any deed in the human's life, more so in healthcare.‚ÄúI may be running out of options, but running out isn‚Äôt an option,‚Äù said Mark Lawrence, at Prince of ThornsThe option is an opportunity, as the chance is the facilitator of competitiveness and quality of care. Former is the missing piece of the majority of proposed solutions.Let's examine some of the significant ResolutionsObamacareThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), often shortened to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, is a United States federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signifies the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory renovation and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The individual mandate to purchase coverage is the fundamental component of the ACA, which, Short, ACA is rendered obsolete. Furthermore, to extend the range to individuals who do not qualify through the state Medicaid expansion program, the federal government has implemented subsidies to reimburse private third-party insurance premiums to outspread coverage to the eligible population. They do so based on their proof of income with cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this funding would have cost about $130 billion from 2017 through 2026.Direct Primary CareIn recent years a new system of cash for service has come up in the country, gaining significant popularity mostly among the physicians practicing in the Midwestern and southern states. Its fundamental business model is primarily based on the concept of the free market, known as Direct Primary Care (DPC). The model has revolutionized healthcare by allowing patients to pay physicians directly for their care. Insurance companies are eliminated from the billing process under DPC and in no way can influence the care patient desires. DPC encompasses different healthcare delivery systems based on financial relationships between the patient and the doctor. Direct Primary Care is about more than reimbursement. It signifies that physicians are starting to step out of the woods and are educating their patients to do the same, making it the most important and valuable move of the past few decades.Medicare for AllThe original United States National Health Care Act or the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act is a bill introduced in the United States House of Representatives by former Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 25 Cosponsors. As of October 1, 2017, it had 120 Cosponsors, a majority of the Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives, and the highest level of support the bill has received since Conyers began introducing the bill in 2003. The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance. Under a single-payer plan, most medical care would be paid for by the federal government, ending the need for personal health insurance and premiums and altering specific insurance companies to provide supplemental coverage when non-essential care is required. The national system would be partly paid for through taxes replacing insurance premiums and savings realized through the provision of universal preventative healthcare and eliminating the insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs. Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D. are the four types of amended coverages available to eligible individuals under the Medicare proper. Each Medicare Part covers different healthcare-related costs. While the Centers administer Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D are managed by private insurance companies.Medicaid ExpansionMedicaid expansion is a provision in the ACA that called for expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income Americans. Under the expansion, Medicaid eligibility would be extended to individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.Healthcare Freedom ActRecently Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX-21) introduced the Healthcare Freedom Act. It seems to be the reformed version of the already existing policy, Health Savings Account, or HSA, a tax-advantaged account that enables the patients to pay for current or future healthcare expenses. When combined with a high-deductible health plan, it is meant to offer savings and tax advantages that a traditional health plan can't duplicate. The congressman's proposed plan establishes what he calls ""healthcare freedom accounts"" (HFAs) which presumably act as ""health savings accounts."" But that is with more flexibility to focus on close patient-physician relationship within the direct primary care (DPC) settings, provide portable catastrophic coverage, and give control back to the individual. He projects that HFA will reduce costs. The bill would prevent money deposited by employers or individuals from taxing. Up to $12,000 per year can be deposited into the account. That limit is extended to $17,000 for anyone over 55.The Drawbacks of the Current SolutionsMost solutions today have been subjected to the Spectrum of challenges and their associated pitfalls. For example, the constitutionality of any component of the ACA is currently being challenged in the federal court. Besides constitutionality, one of the major flaws of the ACA is its radical extension of public funds through the federally subsidized program to the private corporations with very little accountability and transparency in place, rendering it the wastebasket for the taxpayers money.Many stakeholders in the healthcare industry have promoted DPC for its benefits, as it helps patients save expenses on primary care and other ancillary services such as clinical tests. The system also allows patients to spend more time with their doctors and choose from whom to receive care. DPC is a great tool but also a unique challenge to independent physicians. Because of its peculiar business model, the DPC is vulnerable to being taken over by corporate companies through the ""Uber scheme,"" making the already corporatized system shoddier. The lucrative nature of DPC is very appealing within the current corporate-dominated market and an excellent opportunity to gain control over the medical practice. Direct primary care overhaul by the corporations would ignite a new flame within the already existing brush fires doctors face from the managed care systems and insurance companies.In addition, despite the insurance industry's takeover of the healthcare arcade- by no means would it be feasible to pull a blind eye over the mainstream 3rd party payer alternatives by abruptly switching over to the DPC or concierge medicine. DPC is the preliminary step toward physician empowerment and genuine patient-centered medical care, so it is on the path to serving as a fundamental reform initiative, which we can appreciate from the recent HFA bill proposed by congressman Chip Roy.Medicare for all, on the other hand, is complex. Historically Medicare has been less than perfect, despite representing the better of the two evils amid private and government-run programs. Still, patients must utilize supplementary government-sponsored subsidized programs, including prescription drug coverage. Medicare Part C and D are administered through private insurance companies to address drug coverage; hence, another wastebasket for the federally allocated funds.Medicaid extension is a federally subsidized state-run program with limited Application. It provides extra assurance to low-asset candidates, including children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, people with disabilities, and the elderly needing nursing home care. Naturally, such expansion has a limited scope and much shorter benefit terms.The Significance of Realistic AttitudePessimism, Realism, and Optimism are a mixture of the attitudes around the healthcare system. Patients are frustrated, physicians burn out, politicians are over-optimistic, and pessimism is the evolving attitude. Nevertheless, natural aptitude is a rare attribute amid the ongoing crisis. Realism is a required optimum but requires transparency and knowledge, the latter of which is hardly attainable beyond proper transparency.So, what is the Realistically best Healthcare System?A sensible healthcare system would ultimately address every individual's medical needs based on the available resources and economic status of the patient's home community. A realistic option may not necessarily be within the direct and immediate reach practicality, thus may require additional steps, which may fail to seem ideal at the beginning, nonetheless be the only realistic alternative to help attain the ultimate goal. Perhaps, Medicare, with all the flaws integrated within and the degree of dependence it has created among the eligible, would be close to impossible to be gotten rid of without implementing a fallback system, even though the contingency option may not be better than the original solution. It also deserves to be signified ‚Äî ‚Äî as most politicians fail to see beyond the substitute juncture, bushwhacking the alternative solutions under its immediate outcome.The utmost grail is establishing and maintaining a free and transparent healthcare marketplace where everyone can afford a personalized, high-quality medical service. The optimum healthcare solution is the best to start with by addressing the immediate goal.The swiftest objective is to make sure all Medicare beneficiaries maintain their coverage without the prerequisite of subsidizing private corporations. While slow, the transition can be smooth with fewer regulations. Medicare is vast, bureaucratic, and inflexible; it requires ingrained structural reform. Its deficiencies undercut patients' comprehensive and integrated care while increasing costs and generating debt. It eventually will require dissolution as the primary solution.Medicare's insufficient benefit package would lead to an enormous gap in coverage, requiring patients to buy costly supplemental insurance. One major defect is the inadequate solution for prescription-drug range and the complex framework.Expanding Medicaid is not an ideal long-term solution if quality healthcare for all is anticipated; nevertheless, it is a legitimate stepping stone to a fundamentally operational solution that is flexible and affordable. However, the expanded Medicaid to all will require federal support by allocating already established Medicare funds through a transparent, structured, accountable gated stream.Municipality of negotiation between the public and private entitiesHealthcare Leaders must avoid direct negotiation between private and government entities unless it is short-lived or essential. Still, to avoid unnecessary pitfalls throughout the transition, Healthcare leaders must practice such talks in the smaller community segments as permissible. For instance, Negotiating drug formulary and price by the county administration with the help of domain experts is the most ideal; as the socioeconomic and community standards of medical practice vary between municipals, thus logical to entertain the negotiation of drugs independently. The same would apply to conciliation for laboratory and radiology services within the discretion of the county governance. Due to the potential economic variation from one borough to another and the variability of the standard of care for the same reason, it is prudent to respect the autonomy of individual target populations. But unfortunately, in contrast to the decentralization of negotiation historically, it has been advantageous for the corporations to maintain the talks as centrally as possible at the state or national scale. Since every clinic, physician and provider offer a different quality of care, and every community holds a contrasting healthcare market, physician fees schedule is also ideally determined independently by every metropolitan district.The Concept of bidding in the Expanded Medicare systemThe bidding system has been applied in many aspects of government projects and negotiations with private entities. It creates competition, improves quality, and reduces costs. It would also be practical for every county to adapt bidding practice while negotiating for drugs, medical supplies, and services with the private businesses.Based on the concept of providing options with no obligation, individual districts must have the opportunity to opt-out of the Medicaid system in reflection of their internal referendum, economic status, and market standing while maintaining access to the transparent negotiated pricing from other counties. To avoid neglectful Opt-out, we must entertain it contingent on purchasing private insurance or available cash assets in the account dedicated to health. Latter must also respect individual choice without jeopardizing the right of fellow citizens. To prevent kickback practices and monopoly, the recourse to import prescription drugs under a well-structured quality assurance program should be available to everyone, as It will respect the fundamentals of the free market.The county and state legislators must make necessary efforts to widen the Spectrum of options by promoting insurance coverage purchases across the state line, increasing competition, and reducing costs.Incorporating social and individual determinants of health and wellness by each county and creating benchmark studies between counties and clinics make the outcome transparent to the public, gradually prompt a competitive environment, and establish free open sooq. We should empower patients by positioning them in control of their medical records, supporting physicians by allying with independent physician collaborators in the county and incentivizing them to contribute. Engage every stakeholder throughout the process without the bias of financial incentives.The ultimate goal is to equalize the value of care and cost between the cash, Medicaid, and private insurance and a Healthcare for all by eliminating the socioeconomic and geographic barriers.medium.com",18/07/2019,1,0,13,2,875,330,2,0,0,9,418
The Comprehensive Guide to Staying on Track With Your Projects,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/the-comprehensive-guide-to-staying-on-track-with-your-projects-dad81655edb6,Zulie Rane,66000,5,951,"It‚Äôs 2019, and not only do you have a side hustle, but you also have two small full-time businesses, your nine-to-five job, and a thriving dog sanctuary to look after. You‚Äôre charging through your life full steam ahead, not to mention faithfully fulfilling all those hobbies that keep you sane.If you‚Äôre like me, you can struggle sometimes to stay on top of it all. At work, my boss invested in a CRM that helps me stay on top of all my tasks. At home? I‚Äôve got to cobble it together with whatever (free) tools I can find.Personally, I write on Medium, I have my personal blog, my YouTube channel, my Instagram, my Patreon, freelance work ‚Äî and of course my day job, my cats, and sometimes I like to do things for fun, like sleep.In the 10 months since I started picking up side gigs, I‚Äôve gone through a series of phases as I‚Äôve struggled to adjust to my increased workload. I love it, don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî I‚Äôd much rather be doing side gigs full-time. But the work is still work.Here is how I‚Äôve learned to stay on top of it all.I used to answer every single email I received. Every single one! I loved answering questions, and I felt like both the question-askers and I got a lot out of it.But it got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I slowed down on the email answering and started compiling frequently asked questions to put into blog posts and my YouTube videos. This was a much more effective method. It also meant I could answer lots of people ‚Äî not just the ones who emailed, but also anyone who found the videos or blog posts.Consolidate tasks if you can, drop them if not. If you want to keep being effective, not get overwhelmed, and make sure you‚Äôre focusing on what matters most to you, only do things worth your while.I use Trello to stay on top of things. For real! I have a board for each one of my projects, and each board has a ‚ÄúTo Do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Progress,‚Äù ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù list.I love dragging things to the ‚ÄúDone‚Äù column, and I found it super easy to use.Now, I have used Evernote, Google Docs, and even just a scraggly old notebook in the past. However, I found all of these things cumbersome for various reasons, and I switched to Trello. I don‚Äôt miss them. The day might come when I move to something else, and that‚Äôs OK.Things that work for me won‚Äôt work for others. Things that have always worked for you may not work in the future.Don‚Äôt commit to one because some freelancing guru told you it was the way forward. Don‚Äôt be afraid to drop things that don‚Äôt work for you. One of my pals has an ancient email thread that she emails herself with that includes to-dos for the week ahead. I judge her for it, but it works for her.This one is a bit counterintuitive. Surely you have to be in constant contact with your inbox, Facebook page, blogging stats, and more to be an effective side-hustler?No! You don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs actively detrimental to you. Every time you‚Äôre trying to get something done and you accidentally spot an email, or a notification, your mind has been trained to drop everything and prioritize that little red badge.I went cold turkey and switched off all my notifications over six months ago. I haven‚Äôt missed them.What I do instead is schedule blocks of time. For example, I write from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., on Thursdays I dedicate two hours to video creation, and I check emails for half an hour each morning. I‚Äôm not interrupted by pesky buzzing, I can stay on track, and I‚Äôm still able to keep up with the important things ‚Äî but on my terms, not on Facebook‚Äôs or Instagram‚Äôs or Google‚Äôs.I‚Äôve never been a workaholic. I‚Äôve never, in my life, felt the need to stay late at work, work weekends, take work home, or check my work emails outside of my scheduled hours.However, things changed when I started working for myself. I found it much harder to walk away from unfinished projects, and I did notice I was staying up later, thinking about work when with my partner, and even spending a lot of my free time working on my work.Don‚Äôt let that happen. If you have to, schedule blocks of time that are work-free ‚Äî maybe the last hour before bed, or weekends, or alternate evenings. It‚Äôs easy to get consumed when you (or your need to sleep) are the only thing standing in the way of your own greatness. But you‚Äôre no good to yourself if you‚Äôre burnt out, if your work stops being fun, or if you‚Äôre too tired to concentrate.Remember your life exists outside of work and outside of your side gig.Balancing all the elements of the modern side-gig life is tough, to be honest. A lot of people make frequent demands on you ‚Äî not to mention the demands you make on yourself ‚Äî and it can feel difficult to keep on top of it all.These four directives are all you need. As long as you‚Äôre only doing things worth doing, not things you feel like you have to do, you‚Äôll automatically prioritize what‚Äôs important. By using the right organizational method (and not being afraid to experiment!) you‚Äôll stay on top of your tasks and not forget important ideas. By switching off your notifications, you can guarantee your time is your own, free from interruptions. And finally, by staying grounded, you ensure you have a life to come back to when you finally make it big.",18/07/2019,2,0,0,3,1050,1050,1,0,0,3,277
Where Does Influencer Responsibility Begin and End?,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/are-influencers-responsible-for-what-they-post-b7a3f4e07d51,Rebecka Wahl,38,3,452,"If we rewind a few years, the social landscape was wildly different. Today, almost anyone can grow a large following online by simply sharing their opinions and other parts of their lives. The ability for anyone to influence raises the question of what the role of an influencer is in society. What are influencers responsible for when it comes to the content they post and the image they create?With the rise of influencer marketing and the knowledge of how much social media can affect mental health, I can‚Äôt help but wonder who carries the responsibility. Consumers? Influencers? Brands?Here‚Äôs the thing: whether you have 1,000 or 100,000 followers, you have the power to influence those who follow you. Influencers can connect with their audience as consumers on a deeper level and influence them more than if they were to see an ad on TV. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many followers you have, because the content you put out impacts everyone who consumes it.In my opinion, influencers can‚Äôt ensure that their content will not be perceived in a negative or harmful way by their consumers. But this doesn‚Äôt rid them of all responsibility.The thing with influencers is that they‚Äôre people like you and me. The only difference is that the content they share has given them a large following. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre obligated to use their platform for good or to discuss important issues.Influencer or not ‚Äî if someone wants to post a photo of themselves in a bikini, they should.That person is not to blame for any feelings of jealousy or negativity I might feel when I see their post. That‚Äôs on me. My reaction has to do with my feelings and insecurities, and they aren‚Äôt the influencer‚Äôs responsibility.However, when you know that a large number of people are looking to you on social media for advice or inspiration, you have to take responsibility and understand how much your content can influence.If you‚Äôve decided you‚Äôre going to sell to people on social media, you‚Äôre responsible for that. This means that you have to consider what you promote seriously. An influencer should never promote something that they don‚Äôt support or lie about a product to generate sales for the brand.In the same way, you as an influencer should think twice about what habits/things you‚Äôre promoting to your followers. Promoting detox products and lying about results you‚Äôve had because of them is not only a scam, but it‚Äôs also extremely damaging to those who purchase it expecting such results.At the end of the day, people shouldn‚Äôt be censored. You‚Äôre not responsible for how others feel about you. However, you are responsible for the content you put out and what kind of image you‚Äôre promoting.",18/07/2019,0,0,0,0,1050,699,1,0,0,2,71
How Can App Developers Make the Most Out of In-App Advertising?,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-can-app-developers-make-the-most-out-of-in-app-advertising-7dfdc9cd6167,Denys Kravchenko,101,6,1287,"The programmatic media ecosystem is rapidly becoming the focal point of successful advertising campaigns. For years, programmatic advertising has provided businesses and marketers exclusivity in targeting their prospects, and better return on investments ‚Äî as well as transparency and reduced operational costs.The budgets allocated to programmatic media advertising rose to 300 percent in the opening half of last year. In addition to that, eMarketer predicts that businesses will spend $77 billion on in-app advertising this year, mainly because of the push on in-app engagement.Thanks to the continuous rise of in-app marketing, app developers have a tremendous opportunity ahead to maximize the revenue potential of their application. It is, however, essential to note that most marketers and agencies often find it difficult to get the desired results from their ad campaigns simply because of the rampant data assumptions and fraudulent activities as well as the more complicated way of monitoring impressions.App developers should also take into account the important players of the programmatic media ecosystem which include the advertiser, publisher, ad exchanges, data management platforms, ad networks, demand-side platforms, agency trading desk, and the supply-side platforms. With that taken into consideration, here are important tips that could help app developers improve their earnings from in-app advertising.It is no secret that creating a profitable app is a comprehensive procedure, let alone scaling one. It‚Äôs important for every developer to scale their app to create more room for growth. By simply scaling their applications, developers are not only able to progressively fix the problems in the app, but also increase their chances of obtaining a higher return on investments.First of all, your code should be clean. The scalability of your application depends on how good the code is. Also, try to make your database have the best scheme. Your system will constantly evolve. Optimization is very important; choose the right infrastructure and tools.And, of course, update your application on an ongoing basis so that all data is actual. You can also simplify the keyword search system in the app store, thereby increasing the number of downloads. You need to identify the keywords your audience is looking for and make contact with influencers via e-mail and social networks.Scaling allows developers to handle a growing number of users and attract companies to take a plunge and do business with them. Scalability enables developers to be more confident about the reliability of their apps when it comes to handling marketing campaigns. The rapid development of your product depends on the wise architecture of the application. And of course, the priority must be scalability, because it directly depends on how the application will cope with a high workload. Before starting development, ask yourself important questions: How many users are you going to attract in the first year? What to do if there are more clients than data? When will all users stop being placed on the same server? Scaling will also help developers cope with the growth of users, and be confident in their marketing strategy.There is an age-old business adage which goes ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt leave jobs, they leave managers.‚Äù The same goes for app development. Most businesses are often anxious about a particular application, especially if they don‚Äôt have any clue who the publishers or authorized sellers of the app are. By expanding app transparency, developers can develop trust with marketers and work within the overall vision of their companies.Accountability is an important factor in successful application development. Team members are responsible for transmitting development information to their partners, and thus have a high level of project transparency. And of course, success and development motivate all employees to do their best on the project. An open environment allows employees to identify and avoid risks at an early stage. So, there are no missed deadlines and no problems with the volume and budget ‚Äî the transparency of the project is your savior.App transparency can simply be done by the use of the mobile version of the ads.txt, which is the app-ads.txt. Generally, the app-ads.txt is a text file that contains the ad sources that are permitted to sell their inventory. Likewise, this text file also can avert domain spoofing issues, wherein unauthorized sellers pretend to sell premium inventory without having access to it. If the information is changed, the content owner may make adjustments to the content of ads.txt.This solution increases the transparency of the entire digital market, preventing fraud, and thereby increasing the credibility of programmatic purchases. It can be expected that ads.txt will quickly cover the global market, especially since many DSP platforms that are interested in clean traffic are behind the widespread introduction of technology.Using this text file further helps developers to capture revenue from brand spends since most brands today often look for app-ads.txt on the application before buying an inventory on the web. To make sure that their applications are covered by the app-ads.txt, developers must able to update their website in app stores and get in touch with their direct ad sources.Measurable impressions indicate the number of times a particular advertisement has appeared in the application. It is, however, imperative to remember that measurable impressions can only tell when a specific ad is viewable ‚Äî but it cannot guarantee whether or not that the user is viewing the screen at the same time.This makes a mobile software development kit a sensible option to get rid of the audience reach concerns, and more importantly, to increase monetization. The only caveat to using traditional mobile SDKs is that it could uplift the size of the app, which can sometimes create unsteadiness and latency.This, however, can be addressed with the help of a specialized mobile SDK known as the Open Measurement Software Development Kit (OM SDK) which was released by the IAB Tech Lab in 2018. Typically, the OM SDK was built to determine verification measurement and third-party viewability for mobile ads without the necessity of several ad verifications from service providers.The OM-SDK is made up of two parts ‚Äî specifically, the OM SDK Native Libraries and the OM SDK JS. Primarily, the OM SDK Native Libraries function as the one who gathers and publishes the signs to calculate the viewable impression of a particular advertisement while the OM SDK JS is responsible for executing the OMID API and building an adapter to pay attention to the cues presented by the OM SDK. With the OMID API, providers can filter data.From the developer‚Äôs side of the application, the OM SDK has two main advantages. OM SDK provides increased trust through transparency. And it also helps developers speed up the application load by reducing the size of the app. Furthermore, the OM SDK is also capable of measuring viewability for native ads, HTML5 videos, native videos, and display ads such as banners, interstitials, and full-screen postings. The OM SDK has a number of advantages: fewer discrepancies in measurements, no more cumbersome applications, and transparent reporting. To increase advertiser confidence in ads purchases in your application, OM SDK will provide more flexibility with respect to its measurement partners.The programmatic advertising industry is moving at a fast rate, and not everyone can catch up with the trends. This makes it essential for every app developer to follow these tips to be able to surge up their proceeds. The undeniable advantage of the ad placement model in the application is the fact that advertising allows you to diversify risks. Even if your application loses its position in the store and you decrease the number of new users, you will still earn from advertising on existing ones. By correctly using the mechanisms of attracting attention in mobile applications, brands can create a favorable environment for themselves and increase the awareness of their audience about new products.",18/07/2019,1,0,3,0,1050,700,1,0,0,5,408

How To Handle Stressful Situations While Maintaining Your Composure,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-handle-stressful-situations-while-maintaining-your-composure-b4ecd7898b3d,HS Burney,1700,5,990,"A key trait of a leader is the ability to remain calm in stressful situations. On rocky seas, when everyone is in panic, the leader needs to hold their paddle steady.However, even the calmest of leaders end up succumbing to emotions sometimes. There are multiple things that demand attention, many competing priorities, and loud voices trying to drown one another out.When a team member comes to you white-knuckled and desperate, it is easy to give in to panic.After all, you are human too.But you are also the lighthouse that shows your team the way. If you panic, everyone panics.Throwing tantrums never helped anyone. To keep the life raft afloat, a leader needs to center it. You need to keep the house of cards balanced.All of this is to say ‚Äî think very, very carefully before you react.When you feel a reaction bubbling to the surface, take a step back. Don‚Äôt respond right away. Park that email for the time being. Tell that person you will call them right back. Put your laptop to sleep and run out for a cup of coffee and a gulp of fresh air.Wait. Wait as long as you possibly can to respond.This curtails your immediate visceral reaction. Cooler heads will prevail and you may realize the situation isn‚Äôt worth reacting over.There may be a different way to handle it. There is always a solution. Unless someone died or lost their life savings, there is always a way out. Sometimes distancing yourself offers the right amount of perspective.You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you, that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.‚ÄîWarren Buffet.An angry client calls you complaining that their payment got returned. A relationship manager on your team is in panic at a mortgage funding delay caused by errors on the loan documents. Your Admin Assistant is in tears because she forgot to purchase tickets to a gala event which is now sold out.These are all normal happenings in my world. But as a leader, removed from the bullpen, I receive most of my information second-hand.I did not initiate the client‚Äôs payment. I was not in charge of the loan funding. I had delegated the responsibility for the gala table purchase.When someone brings a problem to you to solve, remember that everything is colored by their own lens.The payment may have gotten returned because the client did not provide the required information. Of course, the angry client conveniently forgot to tell me that.The error on the security documents may be due to the relationship manager putting incorrect information on the credit proposal. Which they glossed over when blaming the service center.The gala tickets may have been purchased by an assistant on another team. They just forgot to mention it to my assistant.Rather than reacting blindly to these situations, it is incumbent upon me to find out more before determining a way forward.Once you have accepted that you have incomplete information, the next step is to find out more.When faced with a panicked team member, ask probing questions to help them think in different directions. Your calm, matter-of-fact queries will help the individual rationalize the problem in their own minds. You can help them brainstorm solutions they may not have thought of in the heat of the moment.Talk to others. Engage other stakeholders in the situation. My personal rule is to always ask at least two additional people for guidance before mapping out a solution. It could be a mentor. It could be a colleague from a different line of business.Talking to a disinterested third party may shift your perspective. It may help you see the problem from a different angle. You may realize that it‚Äôs not such a big deal after all.Yes, I know this sounds counterproductive. But it is a great tool to disengage from the problem and approach it with clinical rationality.In my role leading a Commercial Banking sales team, I am regularly faced with unhappy clients that sometimes threaten to take their business elsewhere.It may be a big client that would have a marked impact on my team‚Äôs performance if they fired us. It may lead to a lower bonus for me at the end of the year. It may tarnish my reputation and limit my career growth.When facing down this client, I challenge myself not to think of these possibilities. The only thing I think about is the problem at hand. And how we are going to solve it.Disengaging from the daunting impact of the problem allows me to assess it dispassionately. If I start dwelling on the consequences, I will freeze.Fear breeds inaction. You cannot come up with a well thought out strategy when your brain is swollen with hundreds of ‚Äòwhat-ifs‚Äô, each scarier than the next. When you feel a threat to your livelihood and your reputation, your body goes into fight or flight mode. In a strong wind, the house of card wavers ‚Äî even if super-glued together.Assume that people have good intentions and want to do the right thing.

Even if your team member did make a mistake, so what? There is always a solution.Work with the person and against the problem. Focus on pooling your skills so you can conquer the problem with a smile. Life is a lot more fun that way.Stressful situations and occasionally total calamities are inevitable as a leader. The true test of your mettle is how you deal with these. As a leader, your team looks to you for guidance.

Attention in Deep Networks with Keras,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-attention-with-keras-dc8dbc1fad39,Thushan Ganegedara,2400,8,1110,"This story introduces you to a Github repository which contains an atomic up-to-date Attention layer implemented using Keras backend operations. Available at attention_keras .To visit my previous articles in this series use the following letters.A B C D* E F G H I J K L* M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z[üîàüî• Latest article üî•üîà]: M ‚Äî Matrix factorizationWith the unveiling of TensorFlow 2.0 it is hard to ignore the conspicuous attention (no pun intended!) given to Keras. There was greater focus on advocating Keras for implementing deep networks. Keras in TensorFlow 2.0 will come with three powerful APIs for implementing deep networks.For more information, get first hand information from TensorFlow team. However remember that while choosing advance APIs give more ‚Äúwiggle room‚Äù for implementing complex models, they also increase the chances of blunders and various rabbit holes.Recently I was looking for a Keras based attention layer implementation or library for a project I was doing. I grappled with several repos out there that already has implemented attention. However my efforts were in vain, trying to get them to work with later TF versions. Due to several reasons:They are great efforts and I respect all those contributors. But I thought I would step in and implement an AttentionLayer that is applicable at more atomic level and up-to-date with new TF version. This repository is available here.Note: This is an article from the series of light on math machine learning A-Z. You can find the previous blog posts linked to the letter below.A B C D* E F G H I J K L* M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y ZIn this article, first you will grok what a sequence to sequence model is, followed by why attention is important for sequential models? Next you will learn the nitty-gritties of the attention mechanism. This blog post will end by explaining how to use the attention layer.Sequence to sequence is a powerful family of deep learning models out there designed to take on the wildest problems in the realm of ML. For example,Which have very unique and niche challenges attached to them. For example, machine translation has to deal with different word order topologies (i.e. subject-verb-object order). So they are an imperative weapon for combating complex NLP problems.Let‚Äôs have a look at how a sequence to sequence model might be used for a English-French machine translation task.A sequence to sequence model has two components, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder encodes a source sentence to a concise vector (called the context vector) , where the decoder takes in the context vector as an input and computes the translation using the encoded representation.There is a huge bottleneck in this approach. The context vector has been given the responsibility of encoding all the information in a given source sentence in to a vector of few hundred elements. Now to give a bit of context, this vector needs to preserve:This can be quite daunting especially for long sentences. Therefore a better solution was needed to push the boundaries.What if instead of relying just on the context vector, the decoder had access to all the past states of the encoder? That‚Äôs exactly what attention is doing. At each decoding step, the decoder gets to look at any particular state of the encoder. Here we will be discussing Bahdanau Attention. The following figure depicts the inner workings of attention.So as the image depicts, context vector has become a weighted sum of all the past encoder states.It can be quite cumbersome to get some attention layers available out there to work due to the reasons I explained earlier. attention_keras takes a more modular approach, where it implements attention at a more atomic level (i.e. for each decoder step of a given decoder RNN/LSTM/GRU).You can use it as any other layer. For example,I have also provided a toy Neural Machine Translator (NMT) example showing how to use the attention layer in a NMT (nmt/train.py). But let me walk you through some of the details here.Here I will briefly go through the steps for implementing an NMT with Attention.First define encoder and decoder inputs (source/target words). Both are of shape (batch_size, timesteps, vocabulary_size).Define the encoder (note that return_sequences=True)Define the decoder (note that return_sequences=True)Defining the attention layer. Inputs to the attention layer are encoder_out (sequence of encoder outputs) and decoder_out (sequence of decoder outputs)Concatenate the attn_out and decoder_out as an input to the softmax layer.Define TimeDistributed Softmax layer and provide decoder_concat_input as the input.Define full model.That‚Äôs it!Not only this implements Attention, it also gives you a way to peek under the hood of the attention mechanism quite easily. This is possible because this layer returns both,for each decoding step. So by visualizing attention energy values you get full access to what attention is doing during training/inference. Below, I‚Äôll talk about some details of this process.Inferring from NMT is cumbersome! Because you have to,I‚Äôm not going to talk about the model definition. Please refer examples/nmt/train.py for details. Let‚Äôs jump into how to use this for getting attention weights.So as you can see we are collecting attention weights for each decoding step.Then you just have to pass this list of attention weights to plot_attention_weights(nmt/train.py) in order to get the attention heatmap with other arguments. The output after plotting will might like below.There was a recent bug report on the AttentionLayer not working on TensorFlow 2.4+ versions. It was leading to a cryptic error as follows,The error is due to a mixup between graph based KerasTensor objects and eager tf.Tensor objects. A fix is on the way in the branch https://github.com/thushv89/attention_keras/tree/tf2-fix which will be merged soon.In this article, I introduced you to an implementation of the AttentionLayer. Attention is very important for sequential models and even other types of models. However the current implementations out there are either not up-to-date or not very modular. Therefore, I dug a little bit and implemented an Attention layer using Keras backend operations. So I hope you‚Äôll be able to do great this with this layer. If you have any questions/find any bugs, feel free to submit an issue on Github.I would be very grateful to have contributors, fixing any bugs/ implementing new attention mechanisms.

Object Detection On Aerial Imagery Using RetinaNet,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-on-aerial-imagery-using-retinanet-626130ba2203,Kapil Varshney,329,12,2468,"For tax assessments purposes, usually, surveys are conducted manually on the ground. These surveys are important to calculate the true value of properties. For example, having a swimming pool can increase the property price. Similarly, the count of cars in a neighborhood or around a store can indicate the levels of economic activity at that place. Being able to achieve this through aerial imagery and AI, can significantly help in these processes by removing the inefficiencies, and the high cost and time required by humans.To solve this problem, we‚Äôll try to detect cars and swimming pools in RGB chips of 224x224 pixels of aerial imagery. The training dataset had 3748 images with bounding box annotations and labels in PASCAL VOC format.This problem along with the dataset was posted by ESRI on HackerEarth as the ESRI Data Science Challenge 2019. I participated and secured the 3rd place in the public leaderboard with a mAP (mean Average Precision) of 77.99 atIoU = 0.3 using the state-of-the-art RetinaNet model. In the following post, I‚Äôll explain how I attempted this problem.RetinaNet has been formed by making two improvements over existing single stage object detection models (like YOLO and SSD):Pyramid networks have been used conventionally to identify objects at different scales. A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) makes use of the inherent multi-scale pyramidal hierarchy of deep CNNs to create feature pyramids.The one-stage RetinaNet network architecture uses a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone on top of a feedforward ResNet architecture (a) to generate a rich, multi-scale convolutional feature pyramid (b). To this backbone RetinaNet attaches two subnetworks, one for classifying anchor boxes (c) and one for regressing from anchor boxes to ground-truth object boxes (d). The network design is intentionally simple, which enables this work to focus on a novel focal loss function that eliminates the accuracy gap between our one-stage detector and state-of-the-art two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN with FPN while running at faster speeds.Focal Loss is an improvement on cross-entropy loss that helps to reduce the relative loss for well-classified examples and putting more focus on hard, misclassified examples.The focal loss enables training highly accurate dense object detectors in the presence of vast numbers of easy background examples.If you are further interested in the finer details of the model, I‚Äôll suggest reading the original papers and this very helpful and descriptive blog ‚ÄòThe intuition behind RetinaNet‚Äô.Now, let‚Äôs get started with the actual implementation and get coding. Here‚Äôs the Github repository you can follow along:github.comWe‚Äôll use the awesome Keras implementation of RetinaNet by Fizyr. I am assuming you have your deep learning machine setup. If not, follow my guide here. Also, I would recommend using a virtual environment. The following script will install RetinaNet and the other required packages.Alternatively, you can use a GPU instance (p2.xlarge) on AWS with the ‚Äúdeep-learning-for-computer-vision-with-python‚Äù AMI. This AMI comes pre-installed with keras-retinanet and other required packages. You can start using the model after activating the RetinaNet virtual environment by workon retinanet command.Note: Retinanet is heavy on computation. It will require at least 7‚Äì8 GBs of GPU memory for a batch size of 4 (224x224) images.Once the RetinaNet is installed, create the following directory structure for this project.I‚Äôll explain each one of these in details, but here is an overview:build_dataset.py ‚Äî Python script to create the train/test setconfig/esri_retinanet_config.py ‚Äî config file to be used by the build script.dataset/annotations ‚Äî directory to hold all image annotationsdataset/images ‚Äî directory to hold all imagesdataset/submission_test_data_images ‚Äî the submission test directory for the Esri Data Science challenge. You can ignore this if you are working on your own dataset and a different project.snapshots ‚Äî the directory where all the snapshots of training will be saved after each epochmodels ‚Äî the directory where snapshots, converted for evaluation and testing. will be savedtensorboard ‚Äî the directory to where training log will be saved to be used by tensorboardpredict.py ‚Äî script to make predictions on the submission test filesFirst, we need to write a config file that will hold the paths to images, annotations, output CSVs ‚Äî train, test, and classes, and the test-train split value. Having such a config file makes the code versatile for use with different datasets.In this config file,TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT = 0.75 . It is a standard practice to have a 75‚Äì25 or a 70‚Äì30 or in some cases even 80‚Äì20 split between training and testing dataset from the original dataset. But, for the purpose of this competition, I did not make a testing dataset and used the complete dataset for training. This was done because only a small dataset of 3748 images was provided. Moreover, a testing dataset of 2703 images was provided (without annotations) on which the model could be tested by submitting the predictions online.Next, let‚Äôs write a Python script that will read all the image paths and annotations and output the three CSVs that are required during training and evaluating the model:Let‚Äôs start by creating a build_dataset.py file and importing the required packages. Notice, we import the esri_retinanet_config.py file that we created earlier in the config directory and we give it an alias config.In the code above, we create an argument parser to take in, optionally, the image and annotation paths, output CSV paths, and the train-test split. Yes, I know we defined these arguments in the config file, already. But, I also realized that there were times when I wanted to create a subsample of images for an experiment or have a different train-test split, etc. At that time, having the option to pass on these arguments when executing the script, without changing the config file, was quicker. You can see that I have provided the default values for each argument from the config file itself. So, you are not required to provide these arguments, unless you want to. After parsing the arguments assign easy variable names for each argument.In the preceding code, we read the image paths into a list, randomize the list, split it into train and test set and store them in another list dataset in the format (<dataset_type>, <list_of_paths>, <outpuCSV>). We‚Äôll also initialize the CLASS set to hold all the unique class labels in the dataset.Next, we loop over each dataset (train and test) and open the output CSV file to be written. For each dataset, we loop over each image path. For each image, extract the filename and build the corresponding annotation path. This works out because, usually, the image and annotation files have the same name but different extensions. For e.g. dataset/images/0000001.jpg has its annotations in dataset/annotations/0000001.xml. Modify this section if your dataset follows a different naming convention. Using BeautifulSoup parse the annotations (XML) file. We can then find the ‚Äúwidth‚Äù and ‚Äúheight‚Äù and the ‚Äúobject(s)‚Äù from the parsed XML.For every image, find all the objects and iterate over each one of them. Then, find the bounding box (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) and the class label (name) for each object in the annotation. Do a cleanup by truncating any bounding box coordinate that falls outside the boundaries of the image. Also, do a sanity check if, by error, any minimum value is larger than the maximum value and vice-versa. If we find such values, we will ignore these objects and continue to the next one.Now, that we have all the information, we can proceed to write to output CSV, one row at a time. Also, keep adding the labels to CLASSES set. This will eventually end up having all the unique class labels.The last thing left to build the dataset in the required format is to write the class labels with their respective indexes to a CSV. In the ESRI dataset, there are only two classes ‚Äî cars (label: ‚Äò1‚Äô, index: 1) and swimming pool (label: ‚Äò2‚Äô, index: 0). This is how the classes.csv looks for Esri dataset.Now, that the dataset is ready and RetinaNet installed, let‚Äôs proceed to train the model on the dataset.To train the model, I used the following command:It is advised to load a pre-trained model or weights file instead of training from scratch to speed up the training (the losses will start to converge earlier). I used the weights from the pre-trained model with ResNet50 backbone on COCO dataset. Use the following link to download the file.The batch-size and the steps will depend on your system config (primarily GPU) and the dataset. I usually start with batch-size = 8 and then increase or decrease by a factor of 2 depending if the model training started successfully or not. If training begins successfully I‚Äôll terminate the training (CTRL+C) and start with a higher batch size else a lower one.Once, you have decided on the batch-size, you‚Äôll need to calculate the steps you‚Äôll need to cover the total dataset in each epoch. The following command will give you the count of rows in train.csv created earlier in the dataset directory.The calculation for step size is simple: steps = count of rows in train.csv / batch-size. Next, set the number of epochs . In my experience, RetinaNet converges quickly, so a smaller number of epochs usually does the work. If not you can always, pick up the training from the last epoch and train your model further. Therefore, we‚Äôll provide a snapshot-path where the model will be saved after every epoch.We will also provide a tensorflow-dir where all the logs will be saved and tensorboard can be run to visualize the training as it proceeds. To launch tensorboard, open a new terminal window and run the below mentioned command. Make sure you have tensorboard installed before running it.Finally, provide the csv files with training dataset and class labels. And execute the training command. Now, go do an Iron Man or sleep or whatever while your model trains. Each epoch with 3748 (224x224) images took a bit over 2 hours on a K80 Tesla GPU on AWS p2.xlarge instance.Once the model has trained to your satisfaction, convert the model in a format that can be used for evaluation and predictions.In this sample evaluation on 125 test images, the model was able to achieve 80.37% mAP (mean Average Precision) with 375 images training for 18 epochs. It‚Äôs a good result for such a small dataset.Build a script predict.py that will use the trained model, make predictions on the submission images and write it on the disk.A few methods from the keras_retinanet utils are required to pre-process the image before it is fed into the model for predictions. Also, import the config file, we created earlier, for loading a few paths.Construct the argument parser to accept arguments when executing the script, and then parse the arguments. The argument model will take in the path to the trained model file which will be used for making predictions. For class labels and predictions output directory, the default values have been taken from the config file. Therefore, these are not required arguments. The argument input will take in the path of the directory containing images to make the predictions on. Also, the confidence argument is available to filter weak predictions.Next, load the class label mapping from the class label CSV and make it into a dictionary. Load the model to be used for prediction. Use the dir path provided in input argument to grab and make a list of all the image paths.Iterate over each image path so that we can make predictions on each image in the provided dataset. Lines 6‚Äì9 in the code above extract the image file name from the image path and then construct and open an output text file path where the predictions for that image will be saved. In lines 11‚Äì15, we load the image, preprocess it, resize it and then expand its dimensions before passing it to the model. In Line 18, we pass the preprocessed image to the model and it returns the predicted boxes (bounding box coordinates), probability scores for each box and the associated labels. In the last line in the block above, rescale the bounding box coordinates according to the original image size.Next, iterate over each detection that is predicted by the model. Skip the ones whose score is less than the confidence value provided. Although, if you want to calculate the mAP (mean Average Precision) keep all the predictions. For this, pass the value of confidence argument as 0.0. Bounding box coordinates will be float values, so convert them into int. Construct the row for each prediction in the required format: <classname> <confidence> <ymin> <xmin> <ymax> <xmax> and write it to the file. Close the file once all the detections for that image have been written to the corresponding file.Run the above command to execute the predict.py script. Feel free to change the arguments according to your dataset and project.Initially, I trained the model using only 10% of the data (375 images) for 18 epochs. This model had mAP of 71 with a confidence value of 0.5 on the test images. I resumed training the model on the complete dataset of 3748 images for another 10 epochs to result in an increased mAP of 74. I decided to engineer the model a bit and make changes to the anchor boxes. The dataset had only square bounding boxes, and I changed the aspect ratios of the boxes from [0.5, 1, 2] to [1]. It seemed like a good experiment to try, but I realized that it wasn‚Äôt as the anchor boxes ratios will change as the images are augmented. It resulted in the network training much faster than before with the total dataset as the network size decreased. The accuracy of predictions also increased a bit but then started to drop. I decided to use the 2nd epoch results with a confidence value of 0.0 to include all predictions. This resulted in the mAP of 77.99 which secured me the 3rd place in the challenge. I also, unsuccessfully, tried a few other experiments with scales of the images to be used for FPN and data augmentation parameters but stuck with earlier results for the final submission.In this post, we talked about the state-of-the-art RetinaNet model and how I used it for the Esri Data Science Challenge 2019 to detect cars and swimming pools in 224x224 tiles of aerial imagery. We started with structuring the project directory. Next, we built the train/test dataset to be used by the model. The model was trained with the appropriate arguments, and later the trained model was converted for evaluation and prediction. We created another script to make detections on the submission test images and to write the predictions on the disk. In the end, I briefly describe the experiments I tried and the results I achieved.arxiv.orgarxiv.orgwww.pyimagesearch.comThanks for going through this post. I hope it helps you.

Can You Embarrass People Into Environmental Awareness?,Better Marketing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/can-you-embarrass-people-into-environmental-awareness-567c13deaf10,David Wyld,2200,13,2898,"Demarketing. When you go to use this word in a sentence outside of a college classroom or some very knowledgeable marketing folks, most times, somebody will stop you in mid-sentence with a response something like, ‚ÄúDewhat‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhadyajustsay???‚ÄùIn a world where the business of business seems to be to encourage ‚Äúmore, more and even more‚Äù‚Ä¶of everything, we typically think of marketing as the key to success. And in 98‚Äì99% of all cases, whatever our organization is, wherever we are, and no matter what kind of product and/or service we may be offering, yes, we want you to use more of it ‚Äî and of us! Sell! Sell! Sell! That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about!However, in a world that seems to be testing the limits of just about everything ‚Äî from the environment to public health to tolerance and more ‚Äî demarketing is taking on an ever more prominent role.The concept originated with a 1971 Harvard Business Review article, in which the authors Philip Kotler and Sidney Levy, defined demarketing as ‚Äúthat aspect of marketing that deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in particular on a temporary or permanent basis.‚Äù Now, when the article was published, the concept mainly dealt with how companies should deal with shortages of their products or how they could make their products seem more exclusive. The thought was that you wanted to keep some demand alive ‚Äî either to intentionally have reduced levels for higher prices (think a high-end hotel)‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶or to deal with temporary situations where demand outstrips supply (think whatever the ‚Äúhot‚Äù Christmas toy might be).In recent years however, the use of the demarketing concept has been applied in a far different fashion. As Kotler himself wrote in a 2017 article for The Marketing Journal, entitled ‚ÄúWelcome to the Age of Demarketing:‚Äù‚ÄúMost of the commercial world spends its time trying to increase the demand for products and services. But we also need a science of ‚ÄúDemarketing‚Äù to help reduce the demand for certain products and services. It would be applied to reduce the demand for ‚Äúvice‚Äù products such as hard drugs, cigarettes, and fatty foods. It would also be used to reduce the use of scarce resources, such as water, clean air, certain fish, and certain minerals.‚ÄùIn this case, what companies ‚Äî and other organizations, such as non-profits, governmental agencies, health organizations, etc. ‚Äî would be seeking was not just to decrease demand, but to extinguish it, if at all possible! When it comes to efforts to promote good behaviors (i.e. healthy living, environmental consciousness, child abuse, etc.), there really would be no incentive to keep any level of demand going. Rather, for activities such as drug use, smoking, overeating, and yes, polluting, demarketing could be used for the betterment not just of the individual, but of society as a whole.And so we see this happening routinely in our society, from efforts to reduce drug abuse and all forms of addictions, sexual assault, obesity, and many more societal ills.Kotler stated in his 2017 article ‚Äî which, oh by the way, he wrote when he was just 86 years young ‚Äî that demarketing ‚Äúworks best when there is high citizen consensus that the consumption of some good or service should be reduced.‚Äù Kotler himself saw that demarketing would play a role in shifting consumer behavior toward promoting greater environmentally friendly actions by consumers.In fact, ‚Äúminimizing harm to nature‚Äù was one of the four conditions that he saw as suited for the demand reduction that demarketing efforts could bring about. Since discouraging the use of plastic disposables was just such a goal that a universal consensus exists (well, except for those employed and lobbying for ‚ÄúBig Plastic‚Äù perhaps!), this would seem like the perfect situation for demarketing to be utilized. And while it might be tough to extinguish such negative actions entirely, any and all reductions in such environmentally harmful actions will ‚Äî no doubt ‚Äî serve to produce societal gains.A very, very interesting demarketing case study currently taking place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The East West Market and its owner, a gentleman named David Lee Kwen, has created with a novel approach to trying to get its customers to use reusable shopping bags. In a word, Kwen thought that embarrassment would prompt the market‚Äôs shoppers to use more reusable shopping bags ‚Äî instead of plastic ‚Äî and cut down on the environmental harm done by what are, for the most part, one-time-use plastic bags.While scientists may disagree on exactly how long it might take for plastic bags to decompose ‚Äî the range of estimates spans from 50 to a 1000 years ‚Äî plastics experts from all around the world can agree on a very scientific answer to the question of just how long your Kroger or Albertsons plastic bag will sit in a landfill. In a nutshell, as Slate famously put it, for plastic scientists and garbologists (yes, that is an accepted scientific discipline!), ‚Äúall these figures are just another way of saying ‚Äòa really, really long time‚Äô.‚ÄùSo, from the Kotlerian perspective, this is a perfect situation for demarketing to be able to promote the ‚Äúright‚Äù consumer behavior to help protect the environment. And hats off to Mr. Kwen for trying, with his one store and an order of a thousand novelty plastic shopping bags, to do a small part to helping curb the seemingly intransigent problem of plastics pollution.What actually happened at the East West Market was quite interesting, and it does perhaps provide some ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù ‚Äî both positively and negatively ‚Äî for other companies seeking to use humor and shame as demarketing tools going forward.The story of how all this came about is indeed quite admirable. Canada has been at the forefront of trying to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. In fact, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in June 2019 that Canada would be banning a number of ‚Äúsingle-use plastics‚Äù ‚Äî everything from plastic bags, plates, cutlery, stir sticks and more ‚Äî by 2021.Vancouver‚Äôs City Council has set specific goals in a timeline for gradually getting rid of single-use plastics by product category. As seen in the graphic below, plastic bags were targeted for elimination later this year in the city ‚Äî as has been done in other British Columbia cities (including Victoria) already.However, B.C.‚Äôs largest city has encouraged business owners to take proactive steps on their own to switch their product and service offerings in advance of the governmental directive to influence ‚Äúbetter‚Äù consumer behaviors ‚Äî and thus have a positive impact on the environment in the meantime as part of its Greenest City Action Plan ‚Äúfor staying on the leading edge of urban sustainability‚Äù and to have zero waste by 2040.As in the European Union and the United States, plastic bags have indeed been targeted as one of the easiest of these items to replace. Many major chains ‚Äî such as Target, Whole Foods Market, TJ Maxx, Trader Joe‚Äôs and many, many more (including Kroger and Albertsons that I named earlier)‚Äî and even individual stores have introduced ‚Äúbranded‚Äù reusable bags for customers.While some stores offer discounts (often 5 cents a bag) for customers to use their own reusable bags over the store‚Äôs plastic offering, more and more, this is looked at as a marketing opportunity as well! Hey, while doing good for the environment, bags emblazoned with the store‚Äôs name and often, good, eye-catching artwork, also serve as a great promotional item for the retailer ‚Äîeven becoming today what marketing analyst, Ted Mininni, President of Design Force, dubbed a modern-day ‚Äúfashion statement.‚Äù Talk about a ‚Äúwin-win!‚ÄùSeeing that the government would seek to eliminate single-use plastic, store owner, David Lee Kwen wanted to take action at his store that would get ahead of the governmental action in Canada. And yes, he took the marketing idea, shall we say, to an ‚Äúeleven!‚ÄùKwen could have simply chosen to produce more of the reusable bags that his store had been encouraging customers to use. He had been charging a fee of five cents a bag, but that did not seem to be dissuading some shoppers from not switching to reusable bags. So, he had an idea, and it was yes, something that would become the stuff of marketing legends, garnering far, far more publicity for this Vancouver grocery store owner than likely he could have ever imagined. I mean, when was the last time that a plastic bag went viral?And so David Lee Kwen ordered up a thousand specially-printed bags for his store, and the East West Market released the following video to explain just why they were doing this.Now the bags were, shall, we say, attention-getting. They were emblazoned with three different fake store names that Mr. Kwen himself says he came-up with:The market‚Äôs slogan for the campaign was simple and straightforward and imprinted at the bottom of the bag: ‚ÄúAvoid the shame. Bring a reusable bag.‚Äù And the goal of all of this was simple. As Mr. Kwen put it: ‚ÄúSo many people own reusable bags but forget to bring them. We want to help customers remember their reusable bags in a way that will really stick.‚ÄùIn Mr. Kwen‚Äôs mind, the goal was simple: Shame the customer into using a reusable shopping bag at his store. As Fast Company recently pointed out, shame is, and can, be used to change consumer behaviors. In fact, as their writer Eillie Anzilotti put it:‚ÄúPublic shaming is one of the oldest tools to encourage swift behavior change, and that‚Äôs certainly what needs to happen when it comes to eliminating waste, and while warts, colon care, and weird adult videos aren‚Äôt anything to be ashamed about, that doesn‚Äôt mean you want to advertise them on your bag.‚ÄùAnd for Mr. Kwen‚Äôs part, he said that the message he was trying to send was that ‚Äúwe should make a conscious effort to save our planet one step at a time. Plastic bags are a big problem, and every step helps.‚ÄùNow the store‚Äôs effort did stick ‚Äî and it definitely made news! And as can be seen in the Canadian news report on the campaign, while some customers did react to the shame in the intended way, others had a much different reaction that Mr. Kwen likely did not really anticipate.Indeed, many patrons saw the bags as funny‚Ä¶ and yes, that made them collectible ‚Äî and desirable ‚Äî well worth the five-cent cost of the bag for something you could show your friends‚Ä¶ or maybe thousands of them on social media, making the bags go viral! I mean is it really any wonder that these bags sold out in the culture in which we live today?The social media reaction was swift, and the ‚Äúwisdom of the web‚Äù was that the bags were a hit ‚Äî perhaps even too much of one! As one Twitter user put it:And so, yes there were ‚Äúunintended consequences‚Äù to the campaign, but ones that ended-up not only bringing a ton of publicity to Mr. Kwen‚Äôs store (just think of the ROI on that order of a thousand plastic bags!), but perhaps helped the anti-plastic cause in a variety of ways. As Paul Foulkes-Arellano, founder of the London-based Sustainable Design Alliance and speaking for the anti-plastic pollution group, A Plastic Planet, explained that the campaign‚Äôs backfire ‚Äúwas actually a great piece of anti-plastic P.R.‚Äù specifically because of the attention that it garnered. He recently told the New York Times that:‚ÄúThese sorts of initiatives which strike a chord with consumers and are shared millions of times have a huge effect on big businesses. It keeps the topic being discussed in boardrooms and it spurs them on to reduce plastic from their supply chain.‚ÄùThe East West Market case might also teach a valuable ‚Äúlesson learned‚Äù that other businesses ‚Äî and perhaps even non-profits and government agencies ‚Äî should heed as they undertake demarketing campaigns to influence consumer behaviors, which we will analyze in the concluding section of this article.It is interesting to note that Philip Kotler in that same ‚ÄúAge of Demarketing‚Äù article cautioned that a ‚Äúdemarketing campaign might make the product or service more desirable‚Ä¶ banning a book or movie often has this effect.‚Äù (emphasis added) Think about it. The classic parenting mistake is to tell a teenager how bad something is for them ‚Äî that only motivates them more to smoke, drink, vape, get a tattoo, date THAT boy, etc. In the same way, many times, by labeling a product or a service as ‚Äútoo extreme,‚Äù ‚Äútoo dangerous,‚Äù ‚Äútoo obscene,‚Äù etc., demand actually is created by all the buzz around that something!Perhaps the classic marketing examples of things being ‚Äútoo much‚Äù are movies that took on the life of Jesus Christ in ways that some Christians objected to ‚Äî and some REALLY, REALLY objected to, all of which only increased their popularity, their viewing, and yes, their earnings! From ‚ÄúThe Last Temptation of Christ‚Äù to Mel Gibson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Passion of the Christ‚Äù and even to Monty Python‚Äôs ‚ÄúLife of Brian,‚Äù such movies capitalized on boycott efforts to encourage people not to go see them to increase the interest in the films and ultimately, the number of folks who actually saw them in theaters or in their homes.And oh how very right Kotler proved to be in the case of the East West Market‚Äôs novel plastic bags! In a New York Times article on the store‚Äôs anti-plastic bag campaign, Dr. Sabine Pahl, a professor of psychology who works with the International Marine Litter Research Unit at the University of Plymouth, stated: ‚ÄúThe problem is that the messages are not so negative and shameful. They are quite funny, so people probably think it is quirky to carry the bags.‚Äù For his part, Mr. Kwen told The Guardian that in the end, his plan was successful, and yes, while the consequences were indeed unintended, they were no doubt positive for the store, as he stated:‚ÄúSome of the customers want to collect them (the bags) because they love the idea of it. Even if you have the bag, you have to explain its origin to your friends. And then, we‚Äôve started a conversation‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a double-edged sword. We wanted to address an issue, but we‚Äôve also made something popular, so it‚Äôs turned out great.‚ÄùAnd so yes, in the end, the campaign was a bigger ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù than Mr. Kwen could likely ever have imagined in his wildest dreams ‚Äî if you do believe that this was not all in his ‚Äúmasterplan‚Äù to create bags that would go viral and generate tons of attention and publicity for him and his store (and yes, for my part, I do!). For a single-location grocery store in Vancouver to have been Googled and written about in leading newspapers and business publications around the globe about its shopping bags is indeed quite remarkable, even in the social media age in which we live today!However, the big takeaway from all of this, in my opinion as a strategic management professor and consultant, is that you can be just a bit too clever in demarketing efforts such as the one in this case. If publicity is the main goal of such an effort, then this campaign certainly generated it ‚Äî for the store and for the cause.And yes, Mr. Kwen‚Äôs plastic bags now have had worldwide influence and have hopefully reminded many of us about the importance of actually using those resuable shopping bags that are in our homes, our apartments, our offices, and yes, our cars! Perhaps lost in the humor and virality of all of this though was the actual goal of not seeing a thousand more plastic bags end up in a landfill! And while some of Mr. Kwen‚Äôs bags will end up being held onto by customers as conversation pieces ‚Äî which they are, some ‚Äî perhaps even most of these specially printed plastic bags will end up lingering in a Canadian landfill for decades, perhaps for centuries.So, humor and shame do have a definite role to play in demarketing efforts aimed at encouraging sustainable behaviors and discouraging, even extinguishing activities and practices that are particularly harmful. Just maybe run these ideas by a few folks first! If they snicker just a bit too much around the room or the conference table, well, then you may have created a collectible and not something that could be optimally effective as a demarketing tool.But make no mistake, David Lee Kwen deserves a great deal of credit for taking what could have been just another routine order for plastic shopping bags and turning it into one of the great marketing ‚Äî and demarketing ‚Äî moments of recent times! And going forward, Mr. Kwen plans to have the same three fake store labels printed on reusable shopping bags for his customers, so the campaign will live on.Vancouver market tries to end plastic bag use by printing embarrassing messagesVancouver store hands out ‚Äôembarrassing‚Äô plastic bagsThese hilarious plastic grocery bags will teach you to never forget your toteSupermarket Uses Embarrassing Plastic Bags So Customers Will Remember Their Reusable OnesGrocery store urges customers to rethink plastic with embarrassing bagsStore‚Äôs Bid to Shame Customers Over Plastic Bags BackfiresDavid Wyld (dwyld@selu.edu) is a Professor of Strategic Management at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, Louisiana.

"Why you should be a Generalist first, Specialist later as a Data Scientist?",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-be-a-generalist-first-specialist-later-as-a-data-scientist-f26d687f8c6,Admond Lee,6200,5,1056,"When I first started out in data science, what I wanted to become was dead simple ‚Äî be a data scientist. Period.I had no idea if I wanted to become a data science generalist or a specialist. And to be honest, I hadn‚Äôt heard of these terms ‚Äî ‚Äúgeneralist‚Äù and ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù ‚Äî not until after being in this field for quite some time.This makes me wonder the pros and cons of each of this and ponder over my career path in data science.After doing some research online and talking with some people in this field, I‚Äôve made up my thought to become a data science generalist first ‚Äî aka full stack data scientist if you‚Äôd like to call that ‚Äî and a data science specialist after gaining more experience and skills in different areas.And you‚Äôll know why in the later section.In the following writing, we‚Äôll discuss more about generalist and specialist in the context of data science.Before going any further, let‚Äôs first understand what we mean when we talk about being a generalist and a specialist in data science.A generalist is someone that has knowledge in many areas whereas a specialist knows a lot in one area. Simple as that.Particularly in data science, it‚Äôs notoriously hard to become a generalist in all phases of data science project lifecycle. It takes years to acquire all the skills in different areas, yet it‚Äôs not necessary to master all of them.Similarly, it‚Äôs not easy to be a specialist in data science either.Now you might define a generalist as the Jack of all trades, master of none.I couldn‚Äôt agree more about that.And this is precisely the reason why I‚Äôd choose to be a specialist in the later stage of my data science path.After all, being a generalist is not meant to master anything, but rather to understand the full picture of the whole data science project lifecycle.The question is: Why is understanding the full flow of the data science project lifecycle important in the first place?You see. As a data scientist, we don‚Äôt build a machine learning model just for the sake of building it. We first understand the business problem and frame that into a problem that can be solved through data science approach. Then you need to identify data sources and define success metrics. Depending on your company‚Äôs stage of maturity, you might also need to build a pipeline to collect data (YES, you may not even have data in place)‚Ä¶We can still go on and on but here is the point ‚Äî all the job scopes above are part of being a generalist. The good thing is that you‚Äôll get to know the full picture of the data science problem as a generalist ‚Äî as a data scientist in the beginning of your career.In other words, you‚Äôll learn and you‚Äôll grow, tremendously.What I‚Äôm advocating here is this: If you‚Äôre someone who is starting out in data science, my recommendation is to be a generalist first. Go join a startup and take on many hats as you will probably be the only data scientist in your company. Generalists add more value than specialists in a company‚Äôs early days, since you‚Äôre building most of your product from scratch and something is better than nothing.Your machine learning models don‚Äôt have to be a game changer but should be able to provide actionable insights and results.Learn how you can help the company generate more revenues. Learn how you can leverage the existing data or build some pipeline to collect data to solve some problems.Start with the low-hanging fruit first. There isn‚Äôt always a need to go for AI if the company isn‚Äôt ready for that. In fact, normal statistical approach is typically sufficient to tackle some simple problems.The ideal data scientist is a strong generalist who also brings unique specialties that complement the rest of the teamBe a strong generalist. Be the Jack of a trades.Once you‚Äôve enough experience and you‚Äôve found your interest and passion in a specific area (say NLP), then you can deep dive into that, which leads us to the next stage.Say if you‚Äôre a NLP specialist. Your focus could be solely on building the best NLP classifier model given the data. And that‚Äôs it.All the things are already set for you. The business problems are well defined (done by product managers). The pipeline is ready and maintained 24/7 (done by data engineers) and the data is there for collection. What you need to do is do what you‚Äôre best at. This is crucial as you can focus on your expertise and strength to add the highest values to the project.It‚Äôs perfectly fine to be specialist in data science. Being a specialist in your niche plays an important role in a company, which is also something that makes you irreplaceable and valuable to others.At this stage, since now you‚Äôre already experienced in different areas as a specialist in data science. Your experience and expertise are not something that can be easily substituted by others.Even better, you‚Äôll be able to focus on your specialization and work with others as a team with your broad knowledge and understanding of other parts of the data science workflow.You‚Äôre no longer someone who knows only one thing. Instead, you‚Äôre someone who knows many things with the focus on a particular thing that makes you special.Thank you for reading.I hope this explains why I decided to become a generalist first and a specialist later in my data science journey.The idea of being a generalist first, specialist later as a data scientist may sound a bit controversial for some people.At the end of the day, there‚Äôs no right or wrong answer to that. The choice and order don‚Äôt really matter as long as that fits your vision as a data scientist.As always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave your feedback below or you can always reach me on LinkedIn.

Optimizing pandas.read_sql for Postgres,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/optimizing-pandas-read-sql-for-postgres-f31cd7f707ab,Tristan Crockett,48,4,737,"Reading SQL queries into Pandas dataframes is a common task, and one that can be very slow. Depending on the database being used, this may be hard to get around, but for those of us using Postgres we can speed this up considerably using the COPY command. However, there are several ways of using the COPY command to get data from SQL into pandas, with different memory/speed tradeoffs. In this article, we‚Äôll test several different methods against each other.The test dataset is simply the first five million rows of a sample Triage predictions table, which is just one I had handy. I tried to use all thirteen million rows I had in my local Postgres database, but pandas.read_sql crashed so I decided to bring down the dataset to something it could handle as a benchmark.Included which each method are three statistics:Peak memory ‚Äî the highest amount of memory used during the sql read code. This is the important one to see if your program will crash!Increment memory ‚Äî the amount of memory that is still used at the end of the sql read code. In theory, this would be the same for all of the methods, but memory leaks can make different methods retain more memory.Elapsed time ‚Äî the clock time used by the program.The pandas version used here is 0.24.1.First, a quick rundown of the different methods being tested:This is the baseline. Nothing fancy here.Peak memory: 3832.7 MiB / Increment memory: 3744.9 MiB / Elapsed time: 35.91sHere is our first attempt of using the COPY command. The data from the COPY command has to go do a filehandle: what simpler way to do this than using a temporary file?Peak memory: 434.3 MB / Increment memory: 346.6 MB / Elapsed time: 8.93sThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶much better. I‚Äôm not surprised that the elapsed time is far quicker than read_sql, but I‚Äôm a bit surprised that the memory usage is so much different. Anyway, let‚Äôs keep goingDisk I/O can be expensive, especially depending on what type disk is available. Can we speed it up by using a StringIO for the filehandle? This would take more memory, of course, but maybe that‚Äôs a tradeoff we can make.Peak memory: 434.2 MB / Increment memory: 346.6 MB / Elapsed time: 9.82sThis is a surprising result. I would have expected this to use more memory and be faster, but it‚Äôs neither. My hypothesis would be that the peak memory used by the StringIO ends up being surpassed by a spike during the dataframe creation process.Also of note: the increment memory was the same as the temporary file version, which probably tells us that the 346.6 MB is a good reference for what the baseline for that memory should be without any memory leaks.Could we bring down on the memory required for the in-memory option? Given the prior results this may seem like a fool‚Äôs errand, but I already wrote the code so I‚Äôm not going to cut off the test early! Python‚Äôs GzipFile interface wraps a filehandle (in this case, a BytesIO) and handles compression. We let pandas handle the decompression by passing `compression=‚Äôgzip‚Äô` to read_csvPeak memory: 613.6 MB Increment memory: 525.8 MB, Elapsed time: 1:30mNot good! It actually used more memory (and leaked some) compared to the uncompressed versions.Same as the last one, except we bypass pandas‚Äô decompression routines in case they introduced a problem. GzipFile can handle the decompression for us, too!Peak memory: 504.6 MB Increment memory: 416.8 MB, Elapsed time: 1:42mWell, this is better RAM-wise than the pandas decompression, for sure, but this is still worse than the uncompressed versions.The compression idea can also apply to the tempfile method from before. In this case, compression should help us cut down on disk I/O.Peak memory: 517.2 MB Increment memory: 429.5 MB, Elapsed time: 1:35mSimilar to the other gzip examples. Not a good option.Since we‚Äôre trying things out, we have one more avenue to explore: the gzip compression level. The default for all of the prior examples is 9, the highest compression possible. It‚Äôs possible that in doing this, it takes extra memory to do the compression in addition to extra time. What if we flip one of them to the lowest compression level (1)?Peak memory: 761.5 MB Increment memory: 673.8 MB, Elapsed time: 1:13mSlightly better on time, but worse on RAM: it appears that the gzipping process is using a bunch of memory no matter what and doesn‚Äôt stream well.What did we learn here?",17/03/2019,7,0,10,0,,,0,2,0,1,477
13 Essential Newsletters for Data Scientists: Remastered,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/13-essential-newsletters-for-data-scientists-remastered-f422cb6ea0b0,Conor Dewey,9000,6,1209,"If you‚Äôre anything like me, you subscribe to newsletters. Lots of newsletters. Like, too many newsletters. I can‚Äôt help myself. When done right, newsletters are an excellent form of content curation that can help deliver interesting and insightful information to you with minimal effort on your part. Lucky for us, data newsletters are no exception to this rule.In this post, I‚Äôll outline why I think newsletters are such an awesome tool for continued growth in data science. More importantly, I‚Äôll lay out the data science and AI-focused newsletters that I look forward to most throughout the week.It‚Äôs also worth noting that this post has been remastered from a previous post. More concretely, I‚Äôve added more newsletters, elaborated on each one with a small blurb, and cleaned up some structural things.Looking back on when I started out in data science, one of the first and most valuable things that I did was seek out tons of data newsletters. This forced me to stay on top of the latest news in the ever-changing realm of data science.It helped me learn techniques and technologies, introduced me to new concepts and learning resources that I wouldn‚Äôt have known about otherwise and notified me when it came to networking opportunities, public tech talks, and job openings. Most importantly, it did this on a weekly basis.Consistently delivered content curation is invaluable in our current world of clickbait titles and fake news. The amount of information out there is overwhelming. Newsletters help solve this problem by differentiating between signal and noise for you. Why take the time to weed through thousands of posts and find the best ones when others will gladly do it for you?The following collection of newsletters is a perfect example of this. Ranging from data science to machine learning to artificial intelligence, the links delivered by these content curators can serve as a game-changer when it comes to your continued growth as a data scientist.So let‚Äôs get onto the list, in no particular order.Data Science Weekly is definitely a fan-favorite, and for good reason. The newsletter started in 2013 and has pumped out 276 consistent issues since. It starts off with an Editor Picks section and quickly moves onto listing a bunch of data science articles and videos. Furthermore, it includes a section for job openings, tutorials, and books as well. Sent every Thursday, this one is well worth your time.

Machine Learning Models as Micro Services in Docker,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-models-as-micro-services-in-docker-a798e1f068a5,Sambit Mahapatra,781,6,1107,"One of the biggest underrated challenges in machine learning development is the deployment of the trained models in production that too in a scalable way. One joke on it I have read is ‚ÄúMost common way, Machine Learning gets deployed today is powerpoint slides :)‚Äù.Docker is a containerization platform which packages an application & all its dependencies into a container.Activating this container results in the application being active.Docker is used when you have a lot of services which work in an isolated manner and serve as a data provider to a web application. Depending on the load, the instances can be spun off on demand on the basis of the rules set up.Production deployment of regular software applications is hard. If that software is a Machine Learning pipeline, it‚Äôs worse! And in today‚Äôs scenario, you can‚Äôt get away from machine learning, as it is the most competitive edge you can get in the business. In production, a Machine Learning powered application would be using several models for several purposes. Some major practical challenges in Machine Learning models deployment that can be handled through docker are:There can be cases where for one model you need LANG_LEVEL set to ‚Äòc‚Äô while for another LANG_LEVEL should be ‚Äòen_us.UTF-8‚Äô. Put different models in different containers so that isolated environments for different models will be obtained.2. Ununiform library requirements across models.You have developed a text summarizer using tensorflow 1.10. Now we want to have a sentiment analysis using transfer learning which is supported by tensorflow2.0(suppose). Putting them in different containers will not break the app.Another major use case is, you develop ML models in python. But the application you want to make in Go language (for some technical advantages), then exposing the ml model through docker to the app will solve it.3. Ununiform resource requirements across models.You have a very complex object detection model which requires GPU, and you have 5 different neural networks for other purposes which are good to run on CPU. Then on deploying the models in containers, you get the flexibility of assigning resources as per requirement.4. Ununiform traffics across models.Suppose you have a question identifier model and answer generation mode.w The former is called frequently while the latter one is not called that frequent. Then you need more instances of question identifier than answer generator. This can be easily handled by docker.Another scenario is, at 10 am you have 10000 requests for your model whereas at 8 pm it is only 100. So you need to spin off more serving instances as per your requirements, which is easier in docker.5. Scaling at model levelSuppose you have a statistical model which serves 100000 requests per second, whereas a deep learning model capable of serving 100 requests per second. Then for 10000 requests, you need to scale up only the deep learning model. This can be done by docker.Now let‚Äôs see how to create a container of a deep learning model. Here the model I have built is a question topic identifier on the question classifier dataset available at http://cogcomp.org/Data/QA/QC/. Google‚Äôs Universal Sentence Encoder is used for word embedding.While creating a container for a model, the workflow normally has to be followed is:github.comBuild and train the model.To build and train the model, a basic workflow is to get the data, do the cleaning and processing of the data and then fed the data to the model architecture to get a trained model.For example, I have built a question intent classifier model on the TREC dataset available at http://cogcomp.org/Data/QA/QC/. The training data has 6 intents with the number of instances of each is as follows:The model creation can be seen at https://github.com/sambit9238/QuestionTopicAnalysis/blob/master/question_topic.ipynbThe processing steps followed here are:For embedding, Google's universal sentence encoder is used from tensorflow-hub.The model architecture followed is a neural network with 2 hidden layers each with 256 neurons. To avoid overfitting, L2 regularization is used.The model is stored in .h5 file for reuse. Label encoder is stored in the pickle file for reuse.Create an API of the model. (Here we have put it in a flask API).The stored model is put in Flask api so that it can be used in production (https://github.com/sambit9238/QuestionTopicAnalysis/blob/master/docker_question_topic/app.py.)The API expects a list of texts, as multiple sentences will come while using in real time. It goes through cleaning and processing to fed for prediction. The predicted results are scaled to represent the confidence percentage of each intent. The scaled results are then sent in JSON format.For example,input: [ ‚ÄúWhat is your salary?‚Äù]output: {‚ÄòABBR‚Äô: 0.0012655753, ‚ÄòDESC‚Äô: 0.0079659065, ‚ÄòENTY‚Äô: 0.011016952, ‚ÄòHUM‚Äô: 0.028764706, ‚ÄòLOC‚Äô: 0.013653239, ‚ÄòNUM‚Äô: 0.93733364}That means the model is 93% confident that the answer should be a number for this question.Create the requirements file containing all the required libraries.To create a Docker image to serve our API, we need to create a requirement file with all the used libraries along with their versions.Create the Dockerfile with necessary environment setup and start-up operations.A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.For our example, the pre-built python-3.6 image is taken as a base image. Then the pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder model files have been downloaded followed by the installation of required libraries. The 5000 port of docker is exposed, this is the port where flask app will run as it is in the default configuration.Build the docker image. and run the containerNow we have the Dockerfile, flask API and trained model files in a directory. Hence we need to create the docker image out of it. The command for that can be:Now the docker image is created, we need to run the image in a container docker run -p 8888:5000 --name question_topic question_topicIt will make the created docker image run. The port 5000 in the docker is mapped to 8888 port of host machine. Hence, the API will receive and response requests at port 8888. If you want to run the docker in the background and detach it from the command prompt (which will be the case in real time), run it with ‚Äò-d‚Äô option.To check the outputs of the docker let‚Äôs send a post request using curl.input:To supply the input, curl ‚Äî request POST ‚Äî url http://0.0.0.0:8888/predict_topic ‚Äî header ‚Äòcontent-type: application/json‚Äô ‚Äî data ‚Äò{‚Äúrawtext_list‚Äù:[‚ÄúWhere do you work now?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is your salary?‚Äù]}‚Äôoutput:{‚Äúinput‚Äù: ‚Äú[‚ÄòWhere do you work now?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat is your salary?‚Äô]‚Äù,‚Äúoutput‚Äù: ‚Äú[ {‚ÄòABBR‚Äô: 0.0033528977, ‚ÄòDESC‚Äô: 0.0013749895, ‚ÄòENTY‚Äô: 0.0068545835, ‚ÄòHUM‚Äô: 0.7283039, ‚ÄòLOC‚Äô: 0.25804028, ‚ÄòNUM‚Äô: 0.0020733867},{‚ÄòABBR‚Äô: 0.0012655753, ‚ÄòDESC‚Äô: 0.0079659065, ‚ÄòENTY‚Äô: 0.011016952, ‚ÄòHUM‚Äô: 0.028764706, ‚ÄòLOC‚Äô: 0.013653239, ‚ÄòNUM‚Äô: 0.93733364} ]‚Äù}It seems the docker is running fine :)Notes:The mentioned example is not production ready. But it can be production ready by following few things like:",17/03/2019,3,3,17,1,1050,483,1,4,0,8,433
Six Recommendations for Aspiring Data Scientists,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/six-recommendations-for-aspiring-data-scientists-93d12aeb9b9,Ben Weber,8500,6,1072,"Data science is a field with a huge demand, in part because it seems to require experience as a data scientist to be hired as a data scientist. But many of the best data scientists I‚Äôve worked with have diverse backgrounds ranging from humanities to neuroscience, and it takes demonstrated experience to stand out. As a new grad or analytics professional making the jump to a data science career, it can be challenging to build a portfolio of work to demonstrate expertise in this space. I‚Äôve been on both sides of the hiring process for data science roles and wanted to call out some of the key experiences that can help land a job as a data scientist:I‚Äôll expand on these topics in detail, but the key theme in data science is being able to build data products that add value to a company. A data scientist that can build these end-to-end data products is a valuable asset, and it‚Äôs useful to demonstrate these skills when pursuing a data science career.Many companies are looking for data scientists with past experience in cloud computing environments, because these platforms provide tools that enable data workflows and predictive models to scale to massive volumes. It‚Äôs also likely that you‚Äôll be using a cloud platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in your everyday work.The good news is that many of these platforms provide free tiers for becoming familiar with the platform. For example, AWS has free-tier EC2 instances and free usage of services such as Lambda for low volume requests, GCP offers $300 of free credit to try out most of the platform, and Databricks provides a community edition that you can use to get hands on with the platform. With these free options you won‚Äôt be able to work with massive data sets, but you can build experience on these platforms.One of my recommendation is to try out different features on these platforms, and see if you can use some of the tools to train and deploy models. For example, for my model services post I leveraged a tool I was already familiar with, SKLearn, and investigated how to wrap a model as a Lambda function.towardsdatascience.comIn academic courses and data science competitions, you‚Äôre often provided a clean data set where the focus of the project is on exploratory data analysis or modeling. However, for most real-world projects you‚Äôll need to perform some data munging in order to clean a raw data set into a transformed data set that is more useful for an analysis or modeling task. Often, data mungling requires collecting additional data sets in order to transform data. For example, I worked with Federal Reserve data in a past role in order to better understand the asset allocation of affluent households in the US.medium.freecodecamp.orgThis was an interesting project, because I worked with third-party data in order to measure the accuracy of first-party data. My second recommendation is to actually go a step further and build a data set. This can include scraping a website, sampling data from an endpoint (e.g. steamspy), or aggregating different data sources into a new data set. For example, I created a custom data set of StarCraft replays during my graduate study, which demonstrated my ability to perform data munging on a novel data set.towardsdatascience.comOne of the skills that I like to see data scientists demonstrate is the ability to make different components or systems work together in order to accomplish a task. In a data science role, there may not be a clear path to productizing a model and you may need to build something unique in order to get a system up and running. Ideally a data science team will have engineering support for getting systems up and running, but prototyping is a great skill for a data scientists to move quickly.My recommendation here is to try to get different systems or components to integrate within a data science workflow. This can involve getting hands on with tools such as Airflow in order to prototype a data pipeline. It can involve creating a bridge between different systems, such as the JNI-BWAPI project I started to interface the StarCraft Brood War API library with Java. Or it can involve gluing different components together within a platform, such as using GCP DataFlow to pull data from BigQuery, apply a predictive model, and store the results to Cloud Datastore.towardsdatascience.comAs a data scientist, you‚Äôll often need to stand up services that other teams can use within your company. For example, this could be a Flask app that provides results from a deep learning model. Being able to prototype services means that other teams will be able to use your data products more quickly.towardsdatascience.comMy recommendation is to get hands on experience with tools such a Flask or Gunicorn, in order to setup web endpoints, and Dash in order to create interactive web applications in Python. It‚Äôs also useful practice to try setting up one of these services in a Docker instance.While great work should stand on its own, it‚Äôs often necessary to first get your audience‚Äôs attention before explaining why an analysis or model is important. My recommendation here is to learn a variety of visualization tools in order to create compelling visualizations that stand out.towardsdatascience.comCreating visualizations is also a useful way of building up a portfolio of work. The blog post below shows a sample of the different tools and datasets I explored over 10 years as a data scientist.towardsdatascience.comOne of the data science skills that I‚Äôve been advocating for recently is the ability to explain projects in the form of a white paper that provides an executive summary, discusses how the work can be used, provides details about the methodology, and results. The goal is to make your research digestible by a wide audience and for it to be self explanatory, so that other data scientists can build upon it.Blogging and other forms of writing are great ways of getting experience in improving your written communication. My recommendation here is to try writing data science articles for broad audiences, in order to get experience conveying ideas at different levels of detail.towardsdatascience.comData science requires hands on experience with a number of tools. Luckily, many of these tools are becoming more accessible and it‚Äôs becoming easier to build out a data science portfolio.Ben Weber is a principal data scientist at Zynga and an advisor at Mischief.",18/03/2019,4,0,0,0,960,540,1,1,0,18,3400
"How to setup the Python and Spark environment for development, with good software engineering practices",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-the-pyspark-environment-for-development-with-good-software-engineering-practices-5fb457433a86,Bogdan Cojocar,540,6,1137,"In this article we will discuss about how to set up our development environment in order to create good quality python code and how to automate some of the tedious tasks to speed up deployments.We will go over the following steps:A virtual environment helps us to isolate the dependencies for a specific application from the overall dependencies of the system. This is great because we will not get into dependencies issues with the existing libraries, and it‚Äôs easier to install or uninstall them on a separate system, say a docker container or a server. For this task we will use pipenv.To install it on a mac os system for example run:To declare our dependencies (libraries) for the app we need to create a Pipfile in the route path of our project:There are three components here. In the [[source]] tag we declare the url from where all the packages are downloaded, in [requires] we define the python version, and finally in [packages] the dependencies that we need. We can bound a dependency to a certain version, or just take the latest one using the ‚Äú*‚Äùsymbol.To create the virtual environment and to activate it, we need to run two commands in the terminal:Once this is done once, you should see you are in a new venv by having the name of the project appearing in the terminal at the command line (by default the env is takes the name of the project):Now you can move in and out using two commands.Deactivate env and move back to the standard env:Activate the virtual environment again (you need to be in the root of the project):The project can have the following structure:Some __init__.py files are excluded to make things simpler, but you can find the link on github to the complete project at the end of the tutorial.We basically have the source code and the tests. Each job is separated into a folder, and each job has a resource folder where we add the extra files and configurations that that job needs.In this tutorial I have used two classic examples ‚Äî pi, to generate the pi number up to a number of decimals, and word count, to count the number of words in a csv file.Let‚Äôs see first how the main.py files looks like:When we run our job we need two command line arguments: ‚Äî job, is the name of the job we want to run (in out case pi or word_count) and ‚Äî res-path, is the relative path to the jobs. We need the second argument because spark needs to know the full path to our resources. In a production environment, where we deploy our code on a cluster, we would move our resources to HDFS or S3, and we would use that path instead.Before explaining the code further, we need to mention that we have to zip the job folder and pass it to the spark-submit statement. Assuming we are in the root of the project:This will make the code available as a module in our app. Basically in main.py at line 16, we are programatically importing the job module.Both our jobs, pi and word_count, have a run function, so we just need to run this function, to start the job (line 17 in main.py). We also pass the configurations of the job there.Let‚Äôs have a look at our word_count job to understand further the example:This code is defined in the __init__.py file in the word_count folder. We can see here that we use two config parameters to read the csv file: the relative path, and the location of the csv file, in the resources folder. The rest of the code just counts the words, so we will not go into further details here. It‚Äôs worth to mention that each job has, in the resources folder an args.json file. Here we actually define the configuration that we pass to the job. This is the config file of the word_count job:So we have all the details now to run our spark-submit command:To run the other job, pi, we just need to change the argument of the ‚Äî job flag.To wrote tests for pyspark application we use pytest-spark, a really easy to use module.The word_count job unit tests:We need to import the functions that we want to test from the src module. The more interesting part here is how we do the test_word_count_run. We can see there is no spark session initialised, we just received it as a parameter in our test. This is thanks to the pytest-spark module, so we can concentrate on writing the tests, instead of writing boilerplate code.Next let‚Äôs discuss about code coverage. How do we know if we write enough unit tests? Easy, we run a test coverage tool, that tells us what code is not tested yet. For python we can use the pytest-cov module. To run all the tests using code coverage we have to run:where ‚Äî cov flag is telling pytest where to check for coverage.Test coverage results:Our test coverage is 100%, but wait a minute, one file is missing! Why is main.py not listed there?If we consider that we have python code that we don‚Äôt need to test, we can exclude it from the reports. To do this we need to create a .coveragerc file in the root of our project. For this example it looks something like this:Great, we have some code, we can run it, we have unit tests with good coverage. We are done right? Not yet! We also need to make sure that we write easy to read code, following python best practices. To do this we have to inspect our code with a python module called flake8.To run it:It will analyse the src folder. If we have clean code, we should get no warnings. But no, we have a few issues:Let‚Äôs see the code:We can see we have an E302 warning at line 13. That means we need an extra line between the two methods. Then an E231 and E501 at line 15. The first warning on this line, tells us that we need an extra space between the range(1, number_of_steps +1), and config[ , and the second warning notifies us that the line is too long, and it‚Äôs hard to read (we can‚Äôt even see it in full in the gist!).After we solve all the warnings the code definitely looks easier to read:Because we have run a bunch of commands in the terminal, in this final step we are looking into how to simplify and automate this task.We can create a Makefile in the root of the project as the one bellow:If we want to run the tests with coverage, we can simply type:And if we want to run the pi job:That‚Äôs all folks! I hope you find this useful.As always the code is stored on github.",17/03/2019,4,18,57,0,1050,700,1,1,0,7,70

Because otherwise, you‚Äôre going to be a dinosaur within three years‚Äù ‚Äî Mark Cuban, a Serial EntrepreneurHello and welcome, aspirant!If you are reading this and interested in the topic, I‚Äôm assuming that you are familiar with the basic concepts of deep learning and machine learning.If not, don‚Äôt worry! The tutorial is designed in a way that gets you started with deep learning skills from the beginning to the end‚Äïfrom perceptron to deep learning.In this tutorial, we‚Äôll touch base on the aspects of neural networks, models, and algorithms, some use cases, libraries to be used, and of course, the scope of deep learning. In addition to it, other important concepts for deep learning will also be discussed.Any Tom, Dick, and Harry cannot just hear about deep learning wonders, develop interest and start a tutorial. There has to be a fine way of learning, and that‚Äôs why we have laid the foundation work for you. Following are the points that highlight what all you need to do before you fire up your learning process:Note: (If you want to learn more about hardware requirements, go through this hardware guide, and most importantly, do not install deep learning libraries at this step. You‚Äôll be told further in this tutorial.)How Can You Dive Into Deep Learning? Essentially, it all starts with neural networks, and deep learning is nothing but the logical implementation of those networks to abstract useful information from data. In technical terms, it is a discreet method of classification of unstructured input data such as media which includes images, sound, video, and text.Firstly, you need to decide which learning medium suits you the best for your research and study deep learning. It could be blogs, books, videos, or online courses approach. We are listing the sources for you to start with the simplest concept that will help you to get a grip on the subject gradually.Blog Approach- Fundamentals of Deep Learning ‚Äî Starting with Artificial Neural Network- A Deep Learning Tutorial: From Perceptron to Deep NetworksBook Approach- Neural networks and Deep Learning (A free book by Michael Neilson)- Deep Learning (An MIT Press book)Video Approach- Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED- Neural networks class ‚Äî Universit√© de SherbrookeOnline Course Approach- Neural Network by (Enroll starts 27 Nov)- Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Enroll Starts 27 Nov)- Machine Learning By Nando de Freitas (contains videos, slides, and a list of assignments)Dear learners, accept the fact that transformation to becoming a deep learning expert would require plentiful time, many additional resources, and dedicated practice in building and testing models. We, however, do believe that utilizing the resources listed above could set you in motion with deep learning.After you have got the basics, here comes the interesting part‚Äïhands-on experience in deep learning state-of-the-art technology. There are numerous exciting applications and opportunities that the field has to offer. Techniques in deep learning will vary based on your interest and purpose, see below:Computer vision/ pattern recognition: Both are not much different since pattern recognition is also a part of computer vision, many times. However, in broader terms, computer vision includes analyzing only images and is used for object detection, segmentation, vision-based learning, etc. whereas pattern recognition is not restricted to images. It is about the classification of anything which can possess a pattern.To learn, go here:Deep Learning for Computer VisionCS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual RecognitionFor Video and use cases:Detailed lectures on computer visionSpeech and audio recognition: Ever said ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù? I‚Äôm sure, you did. It comprises a speech recognition system that helps you find what you‚Äôre looking for on Google.Technically, it consists of a type of neural network that involves sequences of inputs to create cycles in the network graph called recurrent neural networks (RNNs). They are called ‚ÄòRecurrent‚Äô because they perform the same task for every element of the sequence and perform tasks such as machine translation or speech recognition.To learn, go here:The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks TutorialUnderstanding LSTM Networks (a wildly used RNN variant)For Videos:A friendly introduction to Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN)Natural Language Processing OR NLP: NPL is a way for computers to read, analyze and respond by simulating the human language in a smart and useful manner. Today, technology is widely applied to multiple industry segments such as advertising, customer care, insurance, etc. to automate the process of human-computer interaction.The NPL layer translates user requests or queries into information and searches for a proper response from its database. An advanced example of NLP would be a language translation‚Äïfrom one human language to another.

In fact, it is for real.Reinforce learning introduces a similar concept for a computer agent; whether it fails or succeeds in a particular task, the agent receives rewards and punishments for the action on an object. It gains knowledge on it as part of the deep learning model controlling its actions.To learn, go here:A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Reinforcement Learning (for Java)Simple Beginner‚Äôs guide to Reinforcement Learning & its implementationFor Videos:Deep Reinforcement LearningReinforcement LearningWe discussed many applications and usage of deep learning technologies in step 3. Chances are, for some tasks, traditional machine learning algorithms would be enough. But, if you‚Äôre dealing with a large collection of images, videos, text or speech, deep learning is bliss and everything for you. However, in deep learning, which framework will be the right choice for you is a question for many.Remember, there‚Äôs no right framework, there is only a suitable framework.

Finding similar images using Deep learning and Locality Sensitive Hashing,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-similar-images-using-deep-learning-and-locality-sensitive-hashing-9528afee02f5,Aayush Agrawal,359,8,1143,"In this post, we are trying to achieve the above result, i.e., given an image, we should be able to find similar images from the Caltech-101 database. The post guides with an end to end process on how I went about building this. The entire codebase for replicating the project is in my GitHub repository. The process to achieve the above result can be broken down in these few steps -As I mentioned above, for this project, my goal is to query any given image and find a semantically similar image in the Caltech-101 database. This database contains 9,144 images divided into 101 categories. Each category has about 50‚Äì800 images in them.The first exercise in our project is to obtain a deep learning network which can classify these categories accurately. For this task, we will use a pre-trained ResNet 34 network which is trained on the ImageNet database and transfer learn it to classify 101 categories of Caltech-101 database using Pytorch 1.0 and FastAI library. As I have written about exactly how to do transfer learning with any given dataset in my previous blog, I am just going to outline the process in this blog. You can refer to this notebook to find the code to do the same. Find below the steps to do transfer learning for classifying Caltech-101 images -Now that we have a pre-trained network, we need to extract embeddings from this network for all of our Caltech-101 images. Embedding is nothing but a representation of an object in an N-dimensional vector. An image embedding, in this case, is a representation of an image in N-dimension. The basic idea is the closer a given image to another image their embedding will also be similar and close in the spatial dimension.You can see in the above image taken from this blog that image embedding is a spatial representation of an image in the vectorized form where similar images are close in spatial dimension as well.We can obtain image embeddings from a ResNet-34 by taking the output of its second last Fully-connected layer which has a dimension of 512. To save intermediate calculations in a deep learning model in Pytorch for inspection or in our case to extract embeddings we use Pytorch Hooks. Hooks can be of two types ‚Äî forward and backward. Forward hooks are used to save information passing forward in a network to make an inference while backward hooks are used to collect information about gradients during backpropagation. In our case, we need output of our second last Fully connected layers in the inference stage which means we need to use a forward hook. Let‚Äôs look at the code for creating a hook (also in ‚ÄúExtracting Feature‚Äù section of my notebook) ‚ÄîThe above code is all you need in creating a Pytorch hook. The SaveFeatures class invokes register_forward_hook function from the torch.nn module and given any model layer it will save the intermediate computation in a numpy array which can be retrieved using SaveFeatures.features functions. Let‚Äôs see the code to use this class ‚ÄîLine 1‚Äì2: Invokes the class SaveFeatures using model layer reference to the output of second last fully-connected layer as the input.Line 4‚Äì6: Passing the Caltech-101 data to get their predictions. Note that we are not interested in saving predictions and that‚Äôs why we used ‚Äú_.‚Äù In this case, the intermediate output of second last layers in saved in the variable named ‚Äúsf‚Äù, which is an instance of SaveFeatures class.Line 8‚Äì10: Creating a python dictionary where image path is the key and image embeddings is the value.Now we have embedding representation of each image in Caltech-101 in our dictionary.We can use our newly generated Caltech 101 image embeddings and get a new image, convert it into embedding to calculate distance b/w the new image and all the Caltech 101 database to find similar images. This process is computationally expensive in nature and as a new image embedding have to compare with all the 9K+ image embedding in the Caltech 101 database to find the most similar image(nearest neighbor), which in computational complexity notation is an O(N¬≤) problem and will take exponentially more time to retrieve similar images as the number of images increases.To solve this problem, we will use locality sensitive hashing(LSH) which is an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm which reduces the computational complexity to O(log N). This blog explains LSH in good details in terms of time complexity and implementation. In short, LSH generates a hash value for image embeddings while keeping spatiality of data in mind; in particular; data items that are similar in high-dimension will have a higher chance of receiving the same hash value.Below are the steps on how LSH converts an embedding in a hash of size K-Let‚Äôs now look at how LSH will perform an ANN query. Given a new image embedding, we will use LSH to create a hash for the given image and then compare the distance from image embedding of the pictures of Caltech-101 dataset which shares the same hash value. In this way, instead of doing similarity search over the whole Caltech-101 database we will only do a similarity search with a subset of images which shares the same hash value with the input image. For our project, we are using lshash3 package for an approximate nearest neighbor search. Let‚Äôs look at the code to do the same (you can find the code in the ‚ÄúUsing Locality Sensitive hashing to find near similar images‚Äù section of my notebook)-The above code takes the image embedding dictionary and converts it into LSH table. To query the LSH table, we can use the code below ‚ÄîNow we have our LSH table created let‚Äôs write a script which can take an image URL as an input and give us N(user-defined) similar images from CalTech 101 database. The code for this part is on my Github here.The script does the following task -We can use a similar concept in various applications like finding similar images in our photo gallery, item-item recommendation of similar looking items, doing a web search on images, finding near-duplicate images, etc.Summary (TL;DR).In the blog, we saw an application of deep learning in finding semantically similar images and how to do an approximate nearest neighbor query using Locality-sensitive hashing(LSH) to speed up query time for large datasets. Also, it‚Äôs important to note that we used LSH not on the raw features(images) but on the embeddings which help do fast similarity search in huge collections.I hope you enjoyed reading, and feel free to use my code on Github to try it out for your purposes. Also, if there is any feedback on code or just the blog post, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or email me at aayushmnit@gmail.com.

Building an Article Recommender using LDA,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-build-an-article-recommender-using-lda-f22d71b7143e,Karan Bhanot,3000,5,749,"Due to keen interest in learning new topics, I decided to work on a project where a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model can recommend Wikipedia articles based on a search phrase.This article explains my approach towards building the project in Python. Check out the project on GitHub below.github.comI developed the complete project in Python using classes and did not use Jupyter notebooks like I usually do to understand about classes and how to develop general Python projects. The modules, WikipediaCrawler, Cleaner and Content are defined as classes inside the Modules folder. config file includes the configurations. collectData, generateLDA and evaluator are used to develop and run the model.When you try to run the project, you can use either Pipfile.lock or requirements.txt to install all dependencies.It‚Äôs always a good practice to include any configurations for your project in a common file. While there isn‚Äôt much information in this project, I did define the paths for storing the database, LDA Model, dictionary and corpus inside config.yml file. I decided to keep all of these inside the data folder.The configuration file is based on YAML which is a commonly used data serialisation method in the industry to store human readable configurations. The pyyaml package is required to read YAML files in Python.I developed and designed three modules (as classes) to be used for scraping data from Wikipedia, and working with the data.The class WikipediaCrawler let‚Äôs us crawl Wikipedia articles based on a certain category. On initialisation of this class, it creates a sqlite3 connect and then adds a table wikiData that stores the page id, category, url and content. The collect_data method uses the wptools package to extract the pages and store them in the table. wptools is a Python package that allows us to scrape Wikipedia articles based on a given category.I‚Äôve added two additional methods, get_ids to fetch all page ids and get_urls to fetch all urls, if needed.This module takes in document text and pre-processes that text. I just need to use the function clean_text as it calls all the other functions on our behalf and returns the final result. It does the following:This module connects to sqlite3 database and helps us iterate over the pages and clean their content using Cleaner module. I added other methods to get the page and url by id.Once I had the modules set up, I began scraping for data, training the LDA model and recommending articles.First, I run the file collectData.py which expects two arguments to begin extracting data from Wikipedia and storing it in the database.It creates the directory data if it does not exist. Using WikipediaCrawler, it extracts the pages and stores them to wikiData.db to be used by other files. On completion, it outputs the message: The database has been generatedThe next step is to use the database we created, build a LDA model from it and store it in the data folder.First, I read the database and create a dictionary. I remove all words that appear in less than 5 documents and that appear in more than 80% documents. I tried multiple values and concluded on these numbers by hit and trial. Then, using doc2bow, I create the bag of words which act as the list of keywords. Finally, I generated the LDA Model and saved the model, dictionary and corpus.Finally, everything is ready. We invoke the evaluator.py and pass in a query string based on which we identify the keywords and list the top 10 articles that match the search criteria.I read the query and identify the keywords from it. Then, by invoking the get_similarity method, I calculated the similarity matrix and sort them in the decreasing order so the maximum similarity documents are at the top.Next, I iterate over these results and present the top 10 urls which represent the recommended articles.I created the database with depth 2 and category Machine Learning. It generated the file, wikiData.db. Next, using the generateLDA.py, I created the LDA model.I used the search query as Machine learning applications and was recommended the articles as can be seen in the image below:In this article, I went about how I developed a LDA model to recommend articles to users based on a search query. I worked with Python classes and devised a complete application.If you like this article, check out my other articles:towardsdatascience.comtowardsdatascience.comtowardsdatascience.comAs always, please feel free to share your thoughts and ideas.

7 Machine Learning lessons that stuck with me this year,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/7-machine-learning-lessons-that-stuck-with-me-this-year-27138a96281b,Andres Vourakis,666,6,1183,"I‚Äôve been a student of Machine Learning for the past two years, but this past year was when I finally got to apply what I learned and solidify my understanding of it. So I decided to share 7 lessons I learned during my ‚Äúfirst‚Äù year of Machine Learning and hopefully make this article an annual tradition.Think about the data before you get startedNowadays, it is relatively easy to learn about Machine Learning thanks to the vast selection of learning resources that exist online. Unfortunately, many of them tend to gloss over the data collection and cleaning steps.During my first serious Machine learning project, my team and I run into the BIG question of where do we get our data from? We needed thousands of images of animals and after giving up on the idea of scraping the web, we came across the CIFAR-100 dataset. But just when we thought all of our problems where solved, we realized that we needed to pre-process our data (remove background, scale down, turn into vectors etc.) before feeding it into our Deep Learning model. This turned out to be the most time consuming part of our project (aside from training and tweaking our model over night for about a week).The data part of any Machine Learning project shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked, ‚Äúwhere is the data coming from?‚Äù should be one of the first questions you ask before you get started.Domain knowledge can sometimes matter just as much as technical skillsIt is easy to get caught up on the idea that you only need technical skills to solve problems using Machine Learning. The reality is that you‚Äôll have a hard time getting very far if you only think of the problem in front of you in terms of just numbers and algorithms. For once, it can be difficult to come up with project ideas in a domain that you don‚Äôt know much about. But even if you manage to come up with a great idea, domain knowledge can be extremely helpful when deciding what kind of data you need to collect and the type of features you should use when training your Machine Learning model.You are certainly not expected to be an expert in every domain where you apply Machine Learning techniques, but you should be ready to learn as much as you can and collaborate with those who posses domain expertise.Machine Learning is not the answer to everythingMachine Learning has advanced so rapidly over the past couple of years, that it is no surprise that the number of AI startups is on the rise. There is an urge to ride the AI wave, and more companies seem to be investing on hiring Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientist, in hopes of getting ahead of the competition. But the reality is that Machine Learning is not always the answer, and basic Analytics is often the best and most cost effective solution.Even if a company can justify the use of Machine Learning, that doesn‚Äôt mean it is ready to implement it. I‚Äôve witness the eagerness to leverage the power of Machine Learning at several companies I have worked for, but they often don‚Äôt posses enough relevant data and the quality is questionable.You should always do your research and try different techniques to solve a problem before you start building a Machine Learning model, it could save you lots of time and money.Embrace the tools the community has already createdLearning the fundamentals is critical and it will ensure that you make the best possible decisions when tackling a problem, but coding Machine Learning models from scratch is not very practical.When I started learning about Machine Learning in school, I did my fair share of coding basic algorithms from scratch, but I quickly realized that I didn‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel in order to put the theory into practice. In fact, I started advancing a lot faster in my learning by solving problems using basic Machine Learning libraries and APIs, it simply gave me more time to contemplate a failed approach intelligently and think about optimization.Next time you have a problem, your goal should be to find out if there a ML tool to help you solve it before you start coding one from scratch.Humans and Machines are more powerful togetherDespite what mainstream media wants to led us to believe, the current state of Artificial Intelligence is not yet capable of replacing humans.YouTube is a perfect example of the importance of having a human-in-the-loop, that is a human(s) involved in every phase of the Machine Learning process. Consider for example how YouTube‚Äôs algorithms is wrongly copyright striking and demonetizing thousands of videos, and the creators community is really suffering. Machine learning algorithms are not yet ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough to distinguish between fair use vs copyright on their own and using human judgement to check the algorithmic recommendations and providing feedback is extremely important.Machine-driven systems are very powerful, but they can still fall short of the desired accuracy rates and with the help of humans, they can achieve great things beyond our imagination.Sometimes it‚Äôs all about experience and lots of trial and errorI remember going up to my professor right after lecture and asking him about how to choose the right number of neurons and hidden layers in an Artificial Neural Network. I was hoping for a formula or some kind of standard method to come up with the right combination, but all I got was a slight smirk and the words ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an Art!‚Äù. My professor explained that finding the right combination came down to experience and lots of trial and error. I was a bit disappointed to hear that, but the more I work with Machine Learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks, the more I come to peace with the fact that there is no such thing as ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù in Machine Learning.There are lots of different methods out there to help you optimize your Machine Learning algorithms and you should get familiar with as many as you can, but most importantly, get used to thinking outside the box and doing lots of trial and error.Be willing to ask for helpThis lesson doesn‚Äôt just apply to Machine Learning Engineers, no matter what field you are in, you should recognize the power of asking for help!There is certainly nothing wrong with working alone, but there is no denying that having a partner or a mentor can often help you advance faster and further. Having a mentor has been crucial in my learning process, and I have benefited tremendously from having a second pair of eyes revising my work.A lot of us refrain from asking for help, either for fear of rejection or simply inconveniencing others, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people are willing to go out of their way to lend a helping hand. Practice asking for help and witness how it changes your life for the better.I hope these lessons help you in your Machine Learning career. If you have any questions or would like to share your own lessons, I‚Äôll be happy to read them in the comments!",17/03/2019,1,0,0,8,1050,656,1,0,0,1,166
Taking Google Sheets to (a) Class.,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/taking-google-sheets-to-a-class-47f7f5f4ed98,John DeJesus,248,6,789,"I am currently building a Flask app for teachers. Since Google Drive has been adopted by teachers, Google sheets are used by them also. One of my app‚Äôs features is to easily allow teachers to copy and paste the sheet link into the app and submit it through a form. It will then convert it into a pandas data frame and drop the null rows and columns.It is a work in progress but I wanted to share the class made so far since I don‚Äôt find many Python class examples for data collection or preprocessing. Many of the examples I have seen are useful for teaching the concept of classes. But most of the time they are not practical enough or specific to data science or ML. After all, we could always use more practical examples of Python classes.If this were for analysis purposes, then‚Ä¶yes. But production code, as far as I know, follows an object-oriented programming approach. This means that your code is split between scripts. These scripts are primarily composed of classes and functions. Code written in this manner is also easier to reuse for additional purposes. Take the ecdf function I used in this post as an example.towardsdatascience.comWith this function, you can quickly reproduce this plot immediately as opposed to retyping the same matplotlib templating code over and over again.Of course! I will share this example in pieces and explain each part as we go.gspread is the library used to handle the input and manipulation of our Google sheets. We will use pandas to drop all empty rows and columns in our sheet. gspread-dataframe is our key library to coverting our sheets into data frames. Lastly, oauth2client is the library suggested by gspread to authenticate our credentials. If you are not familiar with this type of authentication you can see how it is performed here.First, we name our class. By convention, classes are named using the CapWords convention. From there we create the init function to tell the class to setup variables assigned to the class. In our case, we will have the class initiate the three variables need to authenticate our credentials.json file.Here we create a method (aka function of a class) that will take the Google sheet link as a parameter. It then uses our instance of self.gc to take in the link and then take the first worksheet in the Google sheet file. Finally, it returns the worksheet we want as sheet.Our second method takes a worksheet as input and converts it into a pandas data frame. It has the @staticmethod class decorator since we do not need to have the class instance self as a parameter to use it. We then use the Pandas dropna data frame method to remove the rows and columns which don‚Äôt contain any values.Now let us step back and admire the entire class as a single entity.I used it as part of the processing for a Flask form. Below is the route function that utilizes our class.If you are not familiar with Flask or Flask forms this may seem confusing. Let‚Äôs focus on the part where we implement our class.After we initiate the class, we then assign the sheet to the variable data. form.google_sheet.data is where the app will obtain the inputted link from the DataInputForm initiated earlier in the route function. The link is then passed into our worksheet_to_df method to be converted and slimmed down.This is actually a partially complete route function. I can‚Äôt reveal too much now but there will be functionality for teachers to upload Excel files as well. I will write more articles related to this class once an MVP version of the app is launched.Writing classes can daunting. If you are studying to be a data scientist or analyst it is not a common concept that comes up. Even the idea of writing functions can seem scary. But you can do it and it is a useful skill.If you can at least build functions you can cut some of the repetitive code writing for your visualizations and ML models. Even better, if your models are going to be integrated into a product, your engineer will thank you for making their life easier when they add your code to their production code.Thanks for reading! I hope this Python class example will help you with building your own data related classes. Try doing one yourself using a data type of your choice. Which will you start with first? The data can be from a CSV or a SQL server. If you are not yet comfortable with making a class, try to turn those processes into functions first, then work your way up to building an entire class around those functions.Until next time,John DeJesus",18/03/2019,0,7,0,0,605,509,4,0,0,10,88
Dataset deduplication using spark‚Äôs MLlib,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/deduplication-using-sparks-mllib-4a08f65e5ab9,Ronald √Ångel,265,6,609,"A deduplication process is always important for companies with a huge amount of data. From one thing, deduplication minimizes the amount of space required to store business data and will bring a lower infrastructure cost and better performance for our pipelines. From another thing, reducing the number of duplicates will reduce the pipelines complexity and will increase the time to business via continuing integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).Sometimes a deduplication process consists of a simple text to text matching and you can simply choose either a CRC32-Checksum or an MD5 matching. However, there are some situations where the dataset rows differ only for some small text discrepancies on some of the columns, even though they represent the same entity. Thus, this article shows an entities recognition and linking process using two different spark approaches over a specific dataset of products collected by scrapping e-commerce websites will be used.The entire code and process describe following could be found here:github.comThe general process could be found on this trait (‚Ä¶ Yes, I use scala for data science !!!):As you will see the idea behind this helper will be having a functional pipe from where easily chain dataframe transforms could be called.Techniques to reduce dimensionality are widely used by the data science community to get a smaller set of features to analyze and obtain better performance while training and evaluating models. The PCA method allows dimensionality reduction while keeping those features that describe a large amount of the information. Consequently, this pre-processing stage follows these steps:The content found on the features above contains most of the discrepancies for candidate duplicate products.Locality-sensitive hashing is a technic used for entity resolution, then records that represent the same entity will be found. The spark MLlib has a custom LSH implementation used here to find duplicates as follow:‚Äî A tokenizer generates the list of words for a record using a words stopper.‚Äî A CountVectorizerModel creates the vectors with hashes and buckets (similar hashes) for the LSH algorithm.Class: com.sample.products.OperationsHelperLSH.scalaTo run an example: Go to the test com.sample.processor.products.ProcessorProductsLshTest and you will see a complete flow running.Input Params:category ‚Üí color = ‚Äònegro‚Äô and productType = ‚Äòtdi‚Äô.nearNeighboursNumber ‚Üí 4hashesNumber ‚Üí 3 (More hashes more precision but more computing cost).Pros:Cons :Levenshtein is an algorithm used for strings fuzzy matching. Basically, this method measures the difference between two strings. Furthermore, the spark windows functions allow dataset analytics function in a concise way, avoiding multiple groupBy and Join operations. Thus, this method defines a 2-level window to group similar data and then applies Levenshtein to values in the same windows to discover duplicates. The process is described here:This window represents the general windows hash for the analysis.Note: the ‚Äúdate‚Äù field helps to order and get only the most recent.As you can see an MD5 representation of the columns is used instead of each String to have better performance:keyhash: MD5 for the category column set. The picture below shows many products within the same category.hashDiff: MD5 hash that represents the non-fuzzy set. The picture below shows products within the same category but with a different description (> levenshteinThreshold) and also those with a small levenshtein (< levenshteinThreshold) difference having the same hashDiff.Class: com.sample.products.OperationsHelperWindowStrategy.scalaTo run an example: Go to the test com.sample.processor.products.ProcessorProductsWindowsTest and you will see a complete flow running.Input Params: levenshteinThreshold ‚Üí 6Results:The results are deduplicated after filtering rn == 1. This removes > 1/3 of the data in the sample dataset.Pros:Cons :A deduplication process depends always on the company needs and the amount of data to analyze. This article describes two different strategies. As a result, Levenshtein with windows functions is good enough for small dimensionality problems; otherwise, LSH is always the best option",17/03/2019,1,4,70,70,866,352,3,11,0,7,102
LSTM-based Handwriting Recognition by Google,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/lstm-based-handwriting-recognition-by-google-eb99663ca6de,Edward Ma,3200,4,495,"Handwriting is a one of the challenge in NLP task. It is because it can be various among different people. On the other hand, some characters (e.g. English) are quite similar. As a human beginning, we leverage contextualize information, lexicon matching.Sometimes, ‚ÄúO‚Äù can be written as ‚Äú0‚Äù while human begin has the capability to distinguish whether it is ‚ÄúO‚Äù or ‚Äú0‚Äù from contextualize information. For example, ‚Äú0‚Äù will be used in phone number while ‚ÄúO‚Äù will be used as part of English word. Another skill is lexicon searching. It helps to guess words even though we cannot recognize every single characters.How can we tackle in via deep learning era? This story will discuss about Fast Multi-language LSTM-based Online Handwriting Recognition (Carbune et al., 2019) and the following are will be covered:Carbune et al. leverage both open and close dataset to validate the model. As usual, IAM-OnDB dataset is used to train a model. During the experiment, they use two representations which are Raw Touch Points and B√©zier Curves.Data will be convert to 5-dimensional points which are x coordinate, y coordinate, timestamp of the touchpoint since the first touch, pen-up or pen-down and new stroke or not. Some preprocessing a necessaryAuthors also evaluate B√©zier Curves whether it is better than Raw Touch Points. From experiment, B√©zier Curves demonstrates a better result.B√©zier Curves is a natural way to present trajectories in space. Authors found that it is more promising that Raw Touch Points. Authors use cubic polynomials of B√©zier curves to calculate features.You may check out this story if you want to refresh the concept of B√©zier Curves. After calculating the curve, 10-dimensional vectors will be generated and feeding into neural network. They are :Handwriting challenge is a well defined problem and there are multiple approaches to deal with it. Segment-and-decode classifiers is one of the example. It splits word to sub-words and classifying it one by one. Another line is using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). It use a chain concept to recognize handwriting and returning string.Carbune et al. use B√©zier Curves as a feature and feeding into Bidirectional LSTM to learn the feature and using softmax layer to get a probability distribution over all possible characters. This is not the end of model, softmax layer generates a sequence of classes and Carbune et al. use Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to decode it and getting the finalized output.Authors measure the character error rates (CER) between different model on IAM-OnDb. For CER, lower is better. You may notice that deeper LSTM is better and curves to outperform than raw touch points.I am Data Scientist in Bay Area.

From Business Intelligence to Data Science & Machine Learning,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/from-business-intelligence-to-data-science-94a1fd866231,Raj,89,7,1255,"I‚Äôm a Manager of Data Science & Machine Learning, specialising in design & building of solutions powered by DS & ML for enterprises for their analytics requirements. I have more than 5 years of extensive experience now in the field and like many, I did not begin my career in Data Science & Machine Learning. I was a Business Intelligence professional with close to 10 years of experience when I decided to take the plunge into Data Science. I‚Äôd like to share my experience of transitioning into the field in the hope that it might help a few who‚Äôre are looking to transition into the field.For those of you who are not familiar with Business Intelligence(BI), it is a branch of technology that enabled the organization to gather all the historical enterprise data that is available to them and start using them to make business decisions both tactical & strategic. As the field of data science & machine learning was just beginning to take off in the early part of the decade (Thanks to the article ‚ÄúData Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century‚Äù https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century that got published in HBR) I felt a strong urge to ride the wave. But later felt that this is a transition that I had to make sooner or later because it was, in my opinion, a logical extension to the field of BI. While the field of Data Science & Machine Learning was about giving business the edge by providing actionable insights and intelligence about the future (some may argue that it‚Äôs also about the present), the field of BI did the same, but using data from the past using lesser sophisticated techniques through dashboarding and visualization techniques.That said, here a few pointers that I‚Äôd like to share with all the wannabe Data Science/Machine Learning professionalsGiven the sudden surge in the demand for data scientists & machine learning professionals when the industry does not have enough talent, most of the demand is being met with people who transitioned to ML & DS from fields as diverse as Bach of Arts, Psychology etc. So don‚Äôt ever feel that you are late in the game. In fact, if you are from the field of BI, you can leverage a lot of your existing data skills in DS/ML (Pandas Dataframe operations could very well be done on a relational table using plain SQL).Apparently even during the age of Darwin, many scientists were ordinary people who took to science out of curiosity & interest and were hence called citizen scientists. Hence, you could be a citizen data scientist too if you have the interest and drive in you.2. Have a structured learning pathMOOCs on DS & ML are plenty these days. I chose to certify in a couple of courses.This is 4-course specialization by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox who founded Turi that later got acquired by Amazon, covering all important areas of machine learning ‚Äî Classification, Regression & Clustering using python which is one of the reasons I chose this program2. Deeplearning.ai(Coursera) https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/This is a 5-part specialization in Deep learning offered by Andew Ng himself explaining the concepts of popular topics ‚Äî Deep Neural Networks, CNN, Sequence Models et al3. Udacity Nanodegree in Deep Learning Specialization https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101This is a 4-month specialization in Deep Learning concepts using Pytorch which is one of the emerging and widely used DL frameworks in the deep learning research community today. I chose this primarily because I wanted to stick to a framework with Python flavour for easier adaptability.Btw, this is not an exhaustive account of courses that I tried and there are many more courses that I‚Äôve done partially but not naming them here. I‚Äôll cover all my course experience in an exclusive story later.3. Get ready to be hands-onWhile these courses help you to get a grounding on the concepts with some hands-on projects, it's important that one practices these concepts in order to build expertise. One of the activities that helped me was to participate in competitions in the popular competition sites such as Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya to keep in touch with your learning. For eg. I took part in the competition ‚ÄúLoan Prediction Challenge III‚Äù from Analytics Vidhya and secured 31st rank in the overall leader board. https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/lbEven though this is a playground competition, it helps you to build confidence in the skills that one has learnt.4. Open other channels of LearningCourses are one of the sources of learning, but it cannot be the only source of learning. It's important to tap into other sources of learning as well in order to develop a wide and broad perspective of topics. Here are other learning activities that I undertake.a) Other online learning content ‚Äî Subscribed to ‚ÄúPractical Deep Learning with PyTorch‚Äù by an NUS researcher on Udemy. https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/learn/v4/content‚ÄùI liked the way he explains the concept of a convolution filter as a filter that looks for specific shapes/patterns in an image. This gives a different perspective on the concepts learnt in the courses mentioned above.b) Follow the works of topmost influencers in the field ‚Äî I follow Jeremy Howard@jeremyphoward, Rachel Thomas@math_rachel ‚Äè(co-founders of fast.ai an advanced pytorch based framework that makes Deeplearning coding a lot easier), Andrej KarpathyYou may follow them on twitter or read their blogs to keep a tab on their works from time to time. Since I chose python based frameworks for my learning, almost all of the above use Pytorch as a framework or a python based libraries for ML & DS. So my list could be biased that way, but essentially the point is that you‚Äôll need to follow those people who are the biggest influencers in the field to be in tune with what they are doing.c) Read blogs ‚Äî Follow blogs of top technology companies that do path-breaking work in ML & DS. I choose the following companies blogs closely through Feedly.Facebook AI Research (FAIR), fast.ai, Google AI blog, AWS ML Blog, Open AI blog. This is not an exhaustive list by any account, but I‚Äôm just calling the top ones5. Don‚Äôt wait to land the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù ML/DL projectOnce the learning is done or even when the learning is on, try to implement the learnings in your current project by proposing ML, DL concepts in your solution design. From my experience working with clients from Fortune 500, most clients don‚Äôt specifically ask for an ML/DL project. Their priorities are always meeting the business objective and the design & approach of the solution is entirely left to us. So, I advise you to look for opportunities where you can put some of the things you learnt to practical use. For instance, I took up implementing text classification tasks using ML and simple sentiment classifier using DL in my projects.6. Take up pet projectsIn addition to projects for clients, taking up pet projects is another great learning opportunity for you and also the organization. This is especially true in the case of DL as most of the projects are in the realm of unstructured data in the form of text & images. So working on some pet project could not only help your knowledge grow but also gets your organization to take notice of the skills that you bring to the table and for your team to get hooked onto these concepts.For instance, I‚Äôd taken up the task of building a prototype to automatically detect license plates of cars using object detection technique. More on this later, but below is a snapshot of tool that my team & I built.",17/03/2019,2,0,18,0,429,359,6,2,0,14,180
Bayesian Modeling of Pro Overwatch Matches with PyMC3,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-modeling-of-pro-overwatch-matches-with-pymc3-f1b7d5fc22f1,Jay Franck,107,6,1073,"Professional eSports are becoming increasingly popular, and the industry is growing rapidly. Many of these professional game leagues are based on games that have two teams that battle it out. Call of Duty, League of Legends, and Overwatch are all examples. Although these are comparable to traditional team sports, the novelty of eSports means that less attention has been paid to predicting the outcomes of this burgeoning industry.How do you model adversarial team games? I was first inspired to start this project by reading Christopher Bishop‚Äôs new machine learning eBook, which has a chapter devoted to calculating player rankings in games using the Elo rating system. For those of you familiar with Chess, you may have encountered this metric before. I found a very instructive blog post on The Data Skeptic for this exact topic. All equations posted below were borrowed from the aforementioned Skeptic.In essence, Elo is a framework where the strength of a player is measured by a single number (r_1 = 2000). The predicted strength of any given team is represented by a Logistic Function (R), and the outcome of a given match as a ratio of the strength of a single team over the sum of their rating (E).If a player of strength 2000 is to face off against a player with an Elo rating of 1000, we would predict a very likely win for the former player (E=0.9968).At the end of each match, the players‚Äô scores are updated based on their relative strengths. If the favored player wins (S_i = 1.0), they gain a small positive adjustment in their score. If the underdog wins the match, they can gain a larger amount, as the result was unexpected. In the given example of the underdog winning, their score would change from 1000 to 1031. The favored player‚Äôs score would also decrease.What does this have to do with Overwatch, the immensely popular team-based shooter? I wondered how someone could model the incredible complexity of a team-based sport that is so dynamic without resorting to incredibly convoluted architectures? I saw an example code on the PyMC3 website about encoding professional rugby teams using Hierarchical Normal Distributions. Having just done a blog post on Hierarchical models, I thought I could try something similar!Essentially, we are treating each team as a single entity. This is in spite of the fact that teams consist of multiple players, each working autonomously. We will justify this choice in two ways: 1) It is easier to model a team as a single rating, rather than each individual player, 2) the teammates are working together (ideally), so they can be modeled as a collective unit. The Elo rating is also incredibly helpful if two teams have not played against one another before. Without any historical matchups, we can leverage team matches that the two adversaries had in common to make predictions.Data were scraped from the 2018 season of The Overwatch League. Unfortunately, there are not that many matches from which we can train our model. As the 2019 season is currently ongoing, any interested reader could begin to add this data to the model and see how well it performs! The raw data format had to be cleaned and processed prior to training our model.There are two basic ways we can represent our data, which will change how we construct the model. The simplest approach is to make this a classification challenge. Each Overwatch matchup involves multiple rounds, and the winner of the match secures the most winning rounds. For instance, San Francisco Shock beats Florida Mayhem 3‚Äì2 . We can represent this as a total of 5 records in the data with varying levels of success and failure (0/1).We can construct our data split as follows. For each matchup in the regular season, we model each win and loss as a binary target. Each team‚Äôs Elo rating will be inferred based on the equations listed above, which transform a rating into a Bernoulli trial. Then, we will use our learned ratings to predict all of the matches in the playoffs. Our PyMC3 model will then consist of a Binomial: for a given matchup, do we predict a success or a failure?We can also represent our matchups as fractions. For the same example of a 3‚Äì2 match, with San Francisco Shock winning, we can encode this as a 0.6 win. Now we have slightly more flexibility, as we can model this as a regression task, or still keep it as a classification. This result offers the model more nuance as well. A 0.8 win is a much more favorable outcome than a 0.6 versus the same opponent.Regardless of your choice, the training error seems to be pretty stable. Our model is able to predict which teams will win based on their Elo distributions. What will happen when we apply this model to the Playoffs?We are making a few assumptions during our playoffs evaluation:These assumptions will definitely rear their ugly head. There are only 12 playoff matches in 2018, and eliminations come quickly. This means that if a team had a fairly poor match that is un-characteristic of their true skill, they may not have a chance to redeem themselves. Teams also can gain in strength when a true challenge appears, as is the nature of playoffs.When we apply our model to the playoff data, we get very poor performance. Our model might as well be randomly guessing! What happened here?In the simplest terms, we had a few teams that upset the apple cart. Philly Fusion (Team 9) beat both Boston and New York (winning 4/5 matches) , despite having a lower Elo rating. Fusion then lost to London Spitfire, who ended up winning the tournament, despite being lower ranked than LA Valiant. Go figure! This is why people love to watch sports, as you never know who might win.If you are itching to try a few different Bayesian methods to games like this, Allen Downey‚Äôs book Think Bayes has a section on modelling teams via Poisson processes and their historical scoring record. Recently Tuan posted an article on Towards Data Science on building a betting strategy for professional soccer leagues, which I think would also apply here.Feel free to download the data and my notebooks via my Kaggle repo. I also have a Git repo with some selected notebooks. Leave a comment or a question below and I will do my best to answer it. Thanks for reading!",18/03/2019,3,0,0,17,440,353,11,1,0,15,65
"The path to being the best data analyst: Help, Build, then Do.",Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-path-to-being-the-best-data-analyst-help-build-then-do-43ed6882d4d3,Stephen Levin,1940,6,1138,"A data team often consists of many people, with many skills, using potentially overlapping techniques. This focus on speed distinguishes this role from data scientists or statisticians.Today I‚Äôm focused on answering questions about the business or about how users behave. I‚Äôll refer to these types of questions as mostly in the realm of data analysts, though some organizations call these folks data scientists, too.A good data analyst should be able to interface directly with folks in the business unit that they‚Äôre working with. They need to have a solid understanding of business fundamentals in addition to data chops. A junior analyst may rely on business people asking smart questions, and answering the questions that they‚Äôre asked, quickly. While this is clearly helpful, it‚Äôs not the highest-leverage opportunity for an analyst.The best analysts don‚Äôt only answer the questions that they‚Äôre asked. Actually doing analysis is often the easy part. It‚Äôs other skills that separate an average analyst from the best.When you‚Äôre asked a particular question, it can be tempting to think ‚Äúsure, I can answer that‚Äù. While that might be the first step, it‚Äôs important to get at the root reason for the question. If someone asks for the signup conversion rate across a section of your website, it‚Äôs the analyst‚Äôs job to dig in.Why are you wondering about signup conversion? Would we rather measure conversion to active users? Are you interested in a particular segment? Does the signup rate vary across paid, direct, organic, and social traffic?It‚Äôs unusual that a PM wants a metric for the sake of a metric. They‚Äôre really trying to learn something about the nature of your product or your audience. It‚Äôs your job to know enough about your data sources and about the business itself to answer the next three questions that they didn‚Äôt ask. Short circuiting the back and forth will help your team move faster.Stakeholders may have a rudimentary understanding of what data is available, but they may not understand that a simple alteration of a question might reduce the time to answer from a day to an hour. No data team ever has all of the data that they want, modeled to answer every question.When someone asks a question that would require a new data model or custom work, see if you can reframe their question into one that you can answer quickly with existing data models. This most often to happen when they ask something extremely specific. They might even be asking a better question, but they may not care that much about the specifics.Which of these 10 customer segments has the highest Lifetime Value (LTV)?This is an astute question, and likely means that you‚Äôre dealing with a data savvy stakeholder. Say that ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù at your company that these are your top customer personas. But let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre a young company and haven‚Äôt done segmented LTV calculations yet and have no easy path to getting this answer. You probably have ‚Äútotal dollars collected‚Äù easily accessible, though!In that case I would propose this counter, ‚ÄúWhat about if I give you Total Dollars Collected per user in segment?‚Äù Assuming that none of these user groups are systematically newer or older than others, that‚Äôs probably close enough!If the stakeholder is looking to prioritize marketing campaigns over the next couple of weeks, they‚Äôre not going to want to wait for a new LTV calculation. By reframing the question to one that was close-enough, you unblocked them a week early! That‚Äôs leverage.For quite some time at Zapier, we had better data modeling around the number of Zaps that were ‚Äúturned on‚Äù versus the number of Zaps that ‚Äúhad activity‚Äù. This lead to a tendency to rank various important KPIs and concepts using zaps-turned-on instead of actual activity.In most cases, this was fine (see reframing to be close enough, above), but once we got large enough to start noticing differences between turn on and activity, the data team made a concerted effort to help folks reframe their questions (and KPIs, and dashboards) in terms of activity! This is a better measurement in most cases, and when folks would ask for a turn-on count, we would ask them if that was really what they wanted.The introduction to data driven decision making at many companies will come via an analyst working with the team to turn their goals into measurable outcomes. In the first iteration this often means building a dashboard or similar interface for folks to have access to answer those same first questions without you.Next, you have to build out data structures that are intuitive enough and well documented enough that you can advance to letting people explore the data on their own. Tableau, Looker, and similar tools are designed with the idea of letting savvy business users discover the answers to their own questions. Analysts who empower that will excel. How do we ensure that an analyst isn‚Äôt the only person diving into data? Well‚Ä¶In general, folks aren‚Äôt going to be comfortable mucking around in your data without some training. There are definitely good intros to [Looker|Tableau|Etc] out there, but they won‚Äôt explain your data sets. Good data teams will create intro material using real data, and actual questions that folks might ask in order to get them more comfortable.Success here doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone becomes a power user. Ideally, most people have enough familiarity to look around and feel good. Then, the few folks in various places around the organization that get really good are a massive force multiplier for the data team.At Zapier, it‚Äôs our head of platform, a senior PM, a person in partner ops, and a writer. As good as an analyst might be at ‚Äúunderstanding the business needs‚Äù, you‚Äôll never be in it as deep as they are, and for the 80% of questions that are self-serveable, everyone wins here.Sometimes, your stakeholders are never going to DIY with BI tools. Sometimes, they ask questions that are too difficult to self serve, or require too much nuance. These are the best use of your analytical time. In those cases, you should still be willing and able to help build-it-for-them.The PM and head of platform that I mentioned earlier? They always have the most up-to-date and fastest time-to-insight of any teams in the org because they get so much of the way there themselves. In the best cases, you end up with a new data model that will let those types of questions be easier the next time. Analysts who follow these steps are likely to become the go-to folks on the data team. That‚Äôs good for the business, since you‚Äôre empowering people around the org. Plus it‚Äôs great for your career.‚ÄîAnything else that you see good analysts do regularly?

One hour collaborative workshop framework,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/one-hour-collaborative-workshop-framework-db3670d8b752,Chris Compston,1300,7,1305,"Whether there‚Äôs a need for introducing, or even practising, collaborative cross functional team ideation or tackling a small but particularly thorny user problem where speed to market is key then this framework will aid in that endeavour.One hour is a tight timeframe and there‚Äôs only so much that can be done. This format along with a strict and forced tight brief actually alleviates the pressure of conceptualising the ‚Äòright idea‚Äô first time and can aid in building an understand of continuous experimentationThrough the process of divergent and convergent thinking participants have to react quickly, even subconsciously, to a user problem. Accessing thoughts and ideas that may have been dormant or even previously denounced.Another great thing about this framework is that getting buy-in from people in the business is going to be relatively easy compared to longer workshop. In traditional low Agile/Design/Product maturity companies trying to get the attention of business leaders for a full week Design Sprint or even a day for ideation is an unenviable, if not impossible, task.This framework can very easily be used to prove that including those people that are not often privy to the positive output of cross functional ideation has a huge benefit to the team process and understanding, the product and it‚Äôs customers. There is also residual affects of increasing the aforementioned maturity, giving the team new business avenues to explore and deeper access to ongoing business understanding.Due to the incredibly tight timeframe it‚Äôs important that facilitators are fully prepared upfront. They should not only know the framework inside out, which should be relatively simple, but people and team mix should be decided beforehand and the problem statement identified and confirmed by a Product Manager to ensure the workshop is focused.Next steps should be outlined early; is this workshop merely to introduce collaboration or is there an immediate user problem that needs a potential solution? The outcomes will differ based on why the workshop is required, the latter will require a plan to build a minimum viable product (MVP), it may require more analysis, design and usability testing before the experiment goes live.It‚Äôs also important that the facilitators are relatively experienced as participants are definitely going to push the time boundaries and focus. If there‚Äôs business stakeholders involved it might also be the case that some feel like they are creatively lacking or uncomfortable presenting ideas and they‚Äôll need support with this.The simple things are often forgotten so make sure the right size of room is booked upfront and has all the necessary equipment, which thankfully for this workshop is just pens and paper. Make sure everyone invited is available and aware of the purpose of the workshop and if it‚Äôs possible share the problem statement upfront (unless there‚Äôs a reason to manage how people react to an immediate problem).Although the actually workshop exercises are just one hour it‚Äôs definitely worth booking time either side. With a problem statement that requires further context sharing before the workshop or the team need to be creatively kickstarted then book no more than 30 minutes before. Include maybe 10 to 15 minutes at the end of the workshop to discuss any next steps.With this kind of ideation speed is the key so use something like Crazy 8s to draw out ideas, focus participants minds and keep them within both time and ideation constraints. Sketches are always preferred but some people may feel more comfortable with story boarding or simply writing bullet points and that‚Äôs fine.Each participant and group will have set times to present their ideas, these should be succinct explanations of their conceptual work without getting hung up on any specific functionality details or how it might be delivered.The most effective way to run this, indeed any kind of product ideation workshop, is ensuring a cross functional and diverse view by including people from across the spectrum of product development teams, business stakeholders, subject matter experts and if possible even end users.Depending on the number of problem statements, bandwidth to work on any potential solutions and number of facilitators available the participant numbers can be flexible. Teams should be groups of no less than three and no more than five people, each facilitator can manage two to three groups dependent on experience and each group will have one idea at the end.Having been successful in ensuring a cross functional element to the workshop it‚Äôs worth highlighting that some of those people may not be completely comfortable in the situation. Not everyone is accustomed to working in diverse teams or dealing with end user related problems, some may be relatively nervous in open discussion about, even critique of, creative ideas.Using a Chind≈çgu session, the ‚ÄòJapanese art of inventing ingenious everyday gadgets‚Äô, can alleviate some of that pressure and helps to get everyone, regardless of their creative confidence, in the right mindset. It should prove that ideas are fast and free flowing and that some ideas once iterated could have real customer value.The session is supposed to be fun and a bit silly, expect some laughs!Facilitators preparationChind≈çguExampleIdentify an actual known user problem for the groups to focus on during the ideation. Without this the session won‚Äôt have much value and although some interesting creative concepts may come out it‚Äôs not going to be obvious what problem they‚Äôre actually solving.The statement should following the ‚ÄòHow might we‚Ä¶‚Äô (HMW) format and be based on actual user research findings, data driven themes or insights. The HMW format allows the group to both understand that there is a problem to solve and also helps to start the discussion that will frame their solutions.The group should also agree that this is a problem worth solving. The intention is that everyone involved comes to the consensus that solving this problem for users will have a certain degree of impact to the customer and result in business benefit.Depending on the number of participants and groups there could be more than one problem statement provided, with each group taking one or with a particular persona in mind.Example‚ÄòHow might we increase the number of related articles a logged in user reads on a particular visit?‚ÄôBased on 2 groups of 5 participants.1. Divergent Ideation10 minutes; 5 minute individual exercise, 5 minutes for presentations2. Cross Pollination15 minutes: 10 minute individual exercise, 5 minutes for presentations3. Convergent Ideation15 minute group exercise4. Team Presentation20 minutes: 5 minute presentation, 10 minute group discussionThe crucial decision on which, if any, ideas should go forward can either be taken by the groups involved or by the Product Owner or Manager separately later. Regardless of which solution is taken further it‚Äôs key to identify what a potential MVP could be.It‚Äôs important to remember that the concept of an MVP comes in two distinct flavours ‚Äî to validate riskiest assumptions by understanding what the market wants or to deliver limited functionality for fast customer value and business benefit.The former might simply be a paper prototype to test with users, a survey to gain further insight or a concierge or Wizard of Oz MVP. It might need no development work whatsoever and it‚Äôs not a basic ‚Äòfirst release‚Äô with defined future releases already on the backlog. The purpose of this is to ensure that the team can validate their assumptions before spending any further time or effort to build a real feature.The latter can again be a concierge or Wizard of Oz MVP, but equally it could have further analysis, design work and rapid development to get it into the market quickly. This is more useful if the assumptions are less risky (i.e. the team are more confident they‚Äôre doing the right thing based on prior knowledge or experience) and speed to market could bring greater business benefits.If you‚Äôre looking for more about product, Agile, Lean and design you can follow me on Twitter @ndxcc or read more on Northern Dynamics",17/03/2019,0,0,13,10,1050,341,2,7,0,10,23
Correlation between score and comments on the front page of Reddit,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/correlation-between-score-and-comments-on-the-front-page-of-reddit-a9e7b4f23b64,Jared Whalen,31,5,436,"I‚Äôm not a huge Reddit user but when I‚Äôm there I usually hangout in just a few subreddits (r/dataisbeautiful, r/geography, r/philadelphia, r/emo and a couple others). Other than the popular data viz subreddit, none of these generate the scores you see on the front page of Reddit.I only say all that to point out that I am not tapped into all the nuances of Reddit culture. I did however have a question after perusing the front page of the internet one day ‚Äî is there a correlation between a popular post‚Äôs score and the amount of conversation that garners around it?First things first, getting the data. I took a look at the Reddit homepage api but didn‚Äôt see a way to pull the top posts for a given date and time. So I turned to the Wayback Machine‚Äôs API which can use a specific date and time as an endpoint and will return the url of the closest web capture.Feeling pretty confident that I could scrape a good amount of data for 2018, I jumped over to R and generated a list of complete urls to call the API.Now we can call the Wayback Machine in order to get a list of web captures.This gives us a list of 365 urls to captures from around noon of each day. Now onto the actual web scraping. There are probably quicker ways to do this, but I went with an old fashioned for loop and used the rvest package to scrape the score, number of comments, and r/subreddit of each of the page‚Äôs 25 posts.I included some simple error handling by checking to make sure the length of the r/subreddit value is greater than 0 (i.e. any posts were actually pulled) before adding it to the datalist variable.After the loop is complete, I use rbind to fill the data frame and filter out any problematic data.How did the scrape do? Not too bad. The scrape successfully pulled daily posts for 75% of the year. I didn‚Äôt investigate this too thoroughly since I had enough data to work with, but I think the Wayback Machine had some issues with the Reddit site redesign.Now we have a freshly minted dataset, but in order to produce the visualization I want it needs some wrangling.Now, time to plot. I plotted the number of comments on the x-axis and the score on the y-axis. I used axis limits to account for outliers, The end result was a plot of small multiples grouped by subreddit and labeled with its correlation coefficient.Things I gained from this projectHere is a gist of the entire source code.",18/03/2019,0,5,4,3,1050,1108,2,2,0,3,26

Or, on agile teams there is the standard sprint retrospective. It‚Äôs a healthy thing for teams to discuss: what went well, what didn‚Äôt, how can we improve things for next time, and so on.Design is consultative by nature. This is something I‚Äôve experienced not only in agencies or consultancies, but also in-house teams within large organizations. It‚Äôs common to have a period or engagement on certain projects, teams, or clients, provide a service, and be on your merry way.Because of this, I have found it very helpful to conduct my own personal post-mortems after every design project.I believe that a growth mindset is critical in design. Creative fields tend to attract those gifted with natural talent, and there is a fluency that comes with years of work that can tilt us towards a more fixed view.Because of this, I started doing my own personal reviews after every project, contract, or client. I found this to be such a helpful exercise that it became a standard, and I‚Äôve continued to do this over the course of many years.Take some time after a project ends and reflect on your process, the deliverables, how you behaved, and most importantly ‚Äî how you feel.The idea is that you do this exercise throughout a series of projects and over a period of time so that you can look for patterns. There will usually be some.Experience Design is about thinking as much as it is doing. Even if research doesn‚Äôt necessarily reside with you, thinking critically about how you approach your work is essential for growth.Questions to ask yourself:This is probably the most obvious one, and for many of us the easiest. After all, tangible deliverables are what we master first.Questions to ask yourself:Knowing how to deal with people will often trump the actual work you deliver. It‚Äôs something that makes designers crazy.Learning how to deal with difficult people or conflict is even more important.Truth be told, you will always be remembered more for your behaviour than your design work.Questions to ask yourself:Side note: this answer should always be yes, even if you don‚Äôt want to do it again. Professionalism counts for a lot.Design is such a fun, engaging space. Most of us love what we do. But sometimes clients suck. Projects go off the rails and become stressful. Or things get boring.Understanding our own emotions and how they connect to our outputs is a nuance that is often overlooked.Questions to ask yourself:Once you get in the habit of doing this for yourself, it becomes second nature. You‚Äôll wonder how you ever functioned without it. It‚Äôs very helpful to have your own written records for portfolio development, job interviews, and reviews.",18/03/2019,7,0,8,2,1050,726,2,6,0,2,873
The future of human-computer interaction design,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-human-computer-interaction-design-f5c7810cca95,Harshani Gajanayake,630,8,1821,"A few years ago, the words ‚Äúinput device‚Äù evoked in our mind only two specific objects: the keyboard and the mouse ‚Äî the main instruments used to provide data to a personal computer. Keyboard and mouse are in fact, two of the first input devices in the history of the computer. Nowadays, with the evolution of computers, we have a large set of input devices that changed the way we interact with the computer. For example, we have smartphones, that allow users to interact with a computer using only their hands‚Äô webcams and microphones, used together to make video-calls and many others.Think about when your mobile device on the table. You feel comfortable. When That phone put in your pocket. Totally, that feels uncomfortable. Why is this so weird our relationship with technology is changing all around of us? Think about your first computer. How much longer you spend with the computer for the first time you use it. It‚Äôs maybe one hour or two hours a day. But think about how the world has changed right now for most of us maybe 85% of us use it more than 8 hours. The thing is that we interact with our device as the first thing we do in the morning.80% of us first thing that we interact with in the morning is our mobile device. And another thing is most of us that we interact with before we go to sleep.There have been four major shift in our existence defined by a new relationship with our tools. Before a million years ago we had a hunter-gatherer age. This is the new tools to allow us to extend our psychology and actually survive better this lasted several million years then we had the agriculture age only lasted several thousand years. But it was at this point that new tools allowed us to move from this period of feast and famine. To actually settle to start to move from survival into thriving and built.Communities tools completely changed our relationship and experience as human beings. We then had the industrial age lasted several thousand or so it‚Äôs over 100 years, but again it gave us this ability to completely changes the way that we were able to create and to produce and then finally in only the last under 26 years we have the birth internet the information age and this again completely changed the way that we were able to communicate and completely changed the way that we as a human as species disseminate and read information.Throughout history, in each of these ages, a new relationship with our tools completely change human experience and each one of those stages. This advance in our tools we created also changed us as well.When is your friend‚Äôs birthday? sometimes you forget it. But you had to look that facebook reminder. These things are becoming our memory. The lines are blurring between us and our technology and that‚Äôs gone mean that most of us these things are becoming extensions of us more is going to change in the way that we interact with our technology and our tools in the next 20 years or next ten years rather, and it has done in the last 200 years.What do you think about that augmentation and the extension that technological extension of what makes us?Human now typically talk it that it‚Äôs split up into 3 parts. That is,People are grabbing at the tools that we have around us try and solve problems. We will use any tools that we can find but since time immemorial. There has been this really strong distinction between our mind and our tools. Completely active and our tools are completely passive. They can‚Äôt do anything that they weren‚Äôt told to do a pre-programmed to do or created to do they can only do the things that you tell them to do a scalpel can only cut where the surgeon tells that scalpel to cut it or can‚Äôt itself.Alexa can only do the things that she is pre-programmed to do she can‚Äôt do anything that she wasn‚Äôt coded to do if you next time ask ‚ÄúAlexa, think of the poor engineer? , What is the weather?‚Äù and realize her answer.Viv is an artificially intelligent operating system made from Adi creators of Siri. But unlike Siri and Alexa, you have to know about Viv is actually able to if you ask to do something for you don‚Äôt necessarily know how to do it. But it‚Äôs able to go and write its own pre-code to go and find your answer to something instead of you having to think about what you are going have to do go to this process of press the home button on this application. Viv to something magical and goes away identifiers the skills the tools that she has gone need and it‚Äôs able to simultaneously process that information and come back to you with a result without your having to lift a finger. That is an amazing thing and this watershed moment in technology is called apps.Apps to API‚Äôs what is mean that?That for the first time we as human beings are moving this state of our tool being completely passive to being able to act and think on our behalf is why companies are like Google and Facebook. And also Samsung many of whom work with are feverishly working on this staff right now. They were really first to bring this to market and be the first to make this publicly available. Because it does some amazing things it removes two really important barriers in our lives as Human being as first is this in order to get anything done.Technology is like it means that these two barriers to entry get remove and when they are the world of possibility.What does it mean for us as Human Beings?We are going to able to change the way that we get things done. In today what means for us as designers and the way that we might start thinking about interactions with this form of technology. But I think the most important thing that we‚Äôll need to be thinking of a designer how we build trust with this form of computers.As an example when I m going away to choose foods that I am going to eat this week. Are we really gone to trust technology to choose foods that we‚Äôre going to eat this week? Am I really gone move house based on the information that I get from a tool like this and so that really important thing that we‚Äôll need to think about is trust.As the first part of good communication with the machine is really important. Because most of us daily interaction with technology looks something like this video.Have you notice how we speak to these machines as well as say thing like this, ‚ÄúAlexa, play my favorite music track‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoogle call to brother‚Äù. Why do we do this? It‚Äôs because we‚Äôre focused to communicate in these really Natural ways. You are either speaking Yes or No either said the right thing Yes or No. All Human-Computer Interaction with technology is forcibly put into binary And that is not how we speak at all. Communication with depth with we meaning we hesitate we stutter, We don‚Äôt know what we are going to say before we say it. That‚Äôs how human. Actually can communicate and so we as designers will have to think about what is real communication looked like for these machine in order. For us to actually trust that these things understand what we truly mean.The world-famous educator Peter Druker said that the Most important thing is communication is hearing what isn‚Äôt said now our language is imbued. It is the field with meaning. It is the field is a possibility. It‚Äôs got an emphasis and tone and if computers don‚Äôt learn how to recognize the smallest differences in sentences we could be in for some really sticky situation.This is the design language for real human communication and understanding of how a machine can demonstrate it. It‚Äôs aware of tone and depth and emotions and sentiment behind what you say has to be something really important thing that we‚Äôll have to think about as designers the second part is making the process visible and this I think is really important because if we are going to trust these machines to go away and decide how they are going to get something done. When you choose your favorite car then you decide to get in and sit down. After that, you drive the car.There have two really important things. First one is Awareness of context and the second is active feedback so the awareness of context or the communication of context is the vehicle is showing you it knows what it is doing it. It is showing you that it sees the Lion on the road. It‚Äôs showing you that it sees the danger around the other cars that might be where the curve is coming up the second thing that it‚Äôs doing is an active feedback process you can actually feel cars away consulted correcting itself driving taking that corner really cautiously and really and carefully.These two things will be their sorts of principles that we have to think about if we are going to left. Machine and technology start to take the wheel from us and start to get things done for us.The last thing is Co-Creation. Albert Einstein said that ‚ÄúImagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.‚ÄùI think about that when we get to use this technology, and we get to play with it an experiment with it a fantasy is that using technology just for knowledge is great. Because when we could use this technology to get and be a task rabbit subservient slave that it‚Äôs gone to go and find loads of information for me and kind of report back.I think the most amazing thing is human beings that is this opportunity to set these machines in motion and learned to staff with them.When the machine is doing the frees us up as human beings to actually spawn the interesting patterns to let our imagination free to see the things which are interesting to spot the thing which might be an interesting avenue to explore to direct the computer to keep creating down the veins and ultimately create something which neither one of us could independently without each other.And I think designers have got this amazing responsibility, in fact, we already do because these machines are already becoming the extensions of us. And also Designers have an amazing capability because we can either create technologies that lock us into our devices or set us free the immense power of this technology that is coming in the near future‚Ä¶",17/03/2019,2,0,9,3,512,494,3,5,0,1,417
How I left software engineering to become a product designer in a year,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/how-i-left-software-engineering-to-become-a-product-designer-in-a-year-92923f95d6e4,Michelle Chiu,1500,10,2012,"All of us chase the ‚Äúperfect job‚Äù ‚Äî one that encompasses our special checklist of hand-chosen attributes. Some of us spend years in trial and error periods; some of us figure it out earlier. Thankfully, I‚Äôm one of the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù ones. While I can‚Äôt say it was an easy journey, I wholeheartedly know jumping into design was the right move for me.For anyone on their own path of discovery, I hope my story offers reassurance with the unknown ahead; I know reading this a year ago would‚Äôve prevented me from feeling alone in my situation.‚ÄúWhat do I want to do with my life?‚ÄùI was positive I held the answer to this age-old question coming into college. As a seventeen year-old, I thought all the signs were there: I had a ton of fun developing my own websites and apps and even tinkered with electronics in high school. Learning how to harness the capabilities of digital technologies was captivating to me‚ÄîI was convinced software engineering was the perfect match in discipline, and I didn‚Äôt have any reason to think otherwise.Fast forward halfway into my time at Georgia Tech, I wasn‚Äôt so sure anymore. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî I thoroughly enjoyed my curriculum in university and had amazing internship experiences at this point.As an Explorer intern at Microsoft, I‚Äôll never forget participating in my first stand-up meetings, pushing my lines of TypeScript and C# to the immense codebase or learning how millions of people had seen the features I developed my first summer out of college. On top of all this, I got to see Adam Levine perform live ten feet away from me during the Intern Signature Event and attended my first music festival. I had the best summer of my life at that point.At nineteen, fresh out of sophomore year, I was blessed with the opportunity to work at Apple‚Äôs Infinite Loop campus in sunny Cupertino. Through many of the training workshops and executive speaker series, I had an unforgettable time soaking in all I wanted to know about mobile development and the operations behind the internal workings of the technology powerhouse. In the end, I was even able to present my project to the Vice President of Wireless Technologies in a personal one-to-one meeting.When I got back to school, I connected the dots. I started reminiscing on memorable moments back when I was first learning how to program. What I truly missed, as a software engineer in the industry, was the creative freedom and personal connections with others through my projects. My ultimate revelation was that I enjoyed code more as a means of execution: programming was enjoyable because of the way it allowed me to bring my ideas to life. The first time I saw lines of code turn to pixels on the screen felt like magic. And I‚Äôll never forget how my eleventh-grade Digital Electronics teacher, who I personally invited to attend my Girls Who Code graduation, gleamed as she toyed around with my final project.However, I continued to let these hesitations sit and put my feelings on hold. I decided to pursue another internship to give software engineering ‚Äúone last try‚Äù ‚Äî this time at a startup called DoorDash. Although I was brought on as a KP Engineering Fellow, I asked to be put on design work on top of my intern projects. Seeing that my major had a hint of design studies on top of my eagerness to learn, my manager was able put me onboard. There, I got a behind-the-scenes sneak peek into what product design really entailed.Long story short, I was enamored. I found a fit that blended my desire to stay within the technology industry, yet allowed me to flourish without boundaries in an artistic sense. I loved the entire realm of creative problem-solving, which pieced together business challenges with visual experiences. Involving the user through every stage of the process brought a human component to projects that made me more deeply connected to my work, and I was so much more naturally drawn to crafting designs as opposed to implementing them. My gut incessantly nudged me telling me it was the better fit.The rest has been history.Making the switch was as equally exhilarating as it was scary. I knew that if I genuinely wanted to transition into becoming a product designer, I needed the expertise and work experience to prove that I deserved it. I felt so behind, and I knew that the only way to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù was to spend my time valuably. I‚Äôd surely be competing with other students from art schools who had more experience than I did ‚Äî what was I going to do to stand out?I proceeded to learn as much as I could. I read every design-centric Medium article I could find, wrapping my head around fundamental principles and learning how to craft a portfolio of quality work. I stalked websites of designers I admired and followed every design podcast series I could find. I collected books, too ‚Äî one of my favorite all-time reads is the first edition of The Great Discontent gifted to me by my friend Stephen. I watched countless documentaries, even binging the Abstract series on Netflix in 2 days.Below are a couple of links I found incredibly helpful:Abduzeedo, Awwwards, Creative Bloq, Fast Co. Design, Internet Curated, InVision Blog, Nicely Done, UI Movement, UltraLinx, UX Magazine, Maeda.pm, Smashing Magazine, Webdesigner DepotEnvisioning Information, Solving Product Design Exercises: Questions & Answers, Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative, The Design of Everyday Things, Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art, The Visual Display of Quantitative InformationDesigner Mill, Freebiesbug, Graphic Burger, Hello Many, Material Design Tools, Origami UI, Sketch App Resources, Site Inspire, UI8Because of my disadvantageous short-term memory, I kept all of these lessons in a red Moleskin gifted to me by my former DoorDash manager. To this day, I still keep my notes in there, and it‚Äôs been fun to see the empty pages turn into sheets of ink-filled progress. Knowledge only remains words on paper until applied, so I knew I had to put myself to work. For me, it was essential to me to have a game-plan moving forward (I‚Äôm a Virgo to a T).Advice is most valuable when you take action. You can learn as much as you can, but it won‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt apply the lessons and execute.In order to even be considered for any opportunities, I knew I needed a portfolio. My approach was cyclical:On top of showing the work I did from my DoorDash internship, I dug up past work from former hackathons and courses to put in my portfolio as I didn‚Äôt have enough time to dedicate to new initiatives. If you‚Äôre lacking projects of your own, advice I‚Äôve gotten in the past is to improve or redesign existing products or features, reach out to local non-profits, conduct freelance work, or become the lead designer on the applications you build yourself.I then reached out to individuals on LinkedIn around the time the mentorship feature was shipping out, as well as those on Twitter who were willing to offer a hand to junior designers. From every hour-long call I hopped on, email I received, and video chat scheduled, I kept refining my portfolio from the feedback people were sharing. I must‚Äôve spoken with 2‚Äì3 people every week over the course of months.If you don‚Äôt already know, design requires a tough skin. It‚Äôs important to be openly receptive to critique, yet critical enough to know which comments are valuable enough to take action on. What one person might think is the best way might intersect with your own preference, and it‚Äôs imperative to maintain grit to form your own decisions as a designer as well.Additionally, your portfolio is ultimately the story you craft for yourself; the way people interpret the way you work as a designer is determined by how you frame your approach and explain the decisions behind them. I can‚Äôt stress enough how imperative it is to clearly articulate each stage of your process and your intentions behind the work.I might‚Äôve left out an important detail concerning the timing of my career switch ‚Äî it was during my fall exchange semester at Denmark (a whopping eight hours ahead of the Bay Area). It was exciting to have finally gotten interview slots, but the time zone difference was not easy to say the least.One weekend, I was sent over a last-minute design assignment for an opportunity I really wanted and had to miss out on a trip I planned early on with other exchange students. In another instance, I made it to the final round for a shiny design role, but was unqualified to be flown out due to my international presence. As an alternative, I spent four hours on Google Hangouts to recreate the on-site experience over video call, concluding my final interview at 10pm due to the time difference.Starting out as a novice was especially tough when it came to interviews since this very skill depends heavily on practice. Not to mention, months of rejections and countless applications really does test your perseverance and confidence in your abilities.In the end, I‚Äôm so grateful that I ended up with internship offers post-graduation with amazing companies that broadened my horizon of design. You can read more about those experiences in-depth through former blog posts I‚Äôve linked below:medium.commedium.comI‚Äôve had a multitude of people contact me from these pieces asking for guidance, and I‚Äôd love to continue helping others out with interview preparation, take-home assignments, and resum√© revisions.To be frank, 2018 was in many regards very difficult for me personally. I conducted video interviews shortly after losing my father to cancer, resuming my job hunt as if my life hadn‚Äôt just flipped for the long haul. I worried about failing my exchange semester abroad when I abruptly returned to the U.S. to make arrangements for and attend my dad‚Äôs funeral. I hopped from internship to internship with no permanent plans ahead, while hearing about the latest job offer acceptances to amazing companies on social media all year-round. I was told by certain individuals to ‚Äústick to engineering‚Äù because it‚Äôd be ‚Äúbetter for me in the long run.‚Äù Moving from city to city every few months truly got tiring; the toll it took on my physical and mental health started showing during my second internship.However, I‚Äôm grateful for all of the lessons these experiences taught me; it really forced myself to fight for my aspirations.There‚Äôs no question that it‚Äôs easier for me to write this when I‚Äôm on the other side of the picket fence: success takes time (and lots and lots of mistakes). While I acknowledge there was privilege involved in certain aspects of my path, I truly believe that anyone can play a vital role in shaping their own futures ‚Äî as long as they are willing to overcome the hardships that come.As for my next steps, I‚Äôm thrilled to share I‚Äôll be joining the MongoDB product design team! I‚Äôm so excited to be committing to a company that houses talented multidisciplinary creatives and embeds a strong engineering culture. My streak of interning comes to its imminent conclusion, but I am so grateful for each and every experience to get to where I am now.Quite honestly, I still have so much to learn, but I‚Äôm happy I jumped head-first into the deep end. What I do know is that patience, tenacity, and consistency were the key ingredients (sprinkled in with some existential crises and long nights). I truly believe there‚Äôs no linear identical journey for everyone. If there‚Äôs anything I can impart, it‚Äôd be to put in the work, trust the process, and let everything else follow.This article is specially dedicated to my little brother, who‚Äôs also carving his own place in design.

Empathy ‚Äì a key UX Design skill that no job description talks about,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/empathy-a-key-ux-design-skill-that-no-job-description-talks-about-a21eb0e87230,Surya Raveendran Pillai,183,5,909,"‚ÄúPay attention to what users do, not what they say.‚Äù ‚Äì Jakob Nielson.Today, let‚Äôs talk about a vital quality that a UX Designer must have, one that is often not included in UX Design job listings ‚Äì Empathy. One often associates design projects with aspects like functionality, layout, look and feel, user journey, etc. But in order to truly understand the needs and wants of a user, it is necessary to be an empathetic designer.We live in times when the focus is shifting from IQ to EQ when it comes to designing Digital Products, and rightfully so! Empathy should be up there on top of the list with technical skills a UX Designer must possess.Simply put, empathy allows a designer to understand their target user better. Before, we dive in deeper, let‚Äôs start with defining what Empathy means in the Context of User Experience.The¬†Cambridge Dictionary¬†defines empathy as ‚ÄúThe ability to share someone else‚Äôs feelings or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that person‚Äôs¬†situation.‚ÄùBasically, when a UX Designer talks about putting oneself in the shoes of a user, they are talking about empathy.Today, when hyper-personalisation and tailor-made user journeys are becoming the norm and playing a critical role in the success or failure of digital products, the importance of empathy in design is becoming glaringly obvious.Empathy is a skill that can be developed and refined over time. Here are a few practices that‚Äôll help one become a more empathetic designer1. Become a keen observer:It can be very rewarding to carefully observe body language, action and non-verbal expressions while conducting User Interviews. More, often than not, participants aim to please and might not be able to honestly state pain points about the product. In some cases, even if they want to, they aren‚Äôt always able to put the problem clearly into words. Therefore, while they test out the product, it becomes all the more important to observe how they interact with the product.In cases, where you are unable to talk directly to target users, observing their online behaviour and interactions with the product is key. But how do you do it? Through web analytics tools like Google Analytics, heat mapping tools like Crazy Egg and A/B testing.Google Analytics provides insights into how users behave with each page on your website ‚Äì where did they enter from, how long did they stay on your site, what specific actions did they take, and finally, at what point did they exit? Heat map tools help identify areas in your digital product that generate most user actions (clicks, hover, etc.) and helps you experiment with layouts, and conduct A/B testing to test what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Remember ‚Äì Test. Iterate. Repeat.2. Create extensive User Personas:Based on your target demographic and data acquired through user research, sketch out detailed user personas. User personas are fictional character sketches which represent various user types that will use your product or service. It helps one undertsand and map behaviour, needs, motivations and goals of the target user. It is a key step in ‚Äòthinking like a user‚Äô. The personas are composed based on the real data collected from user research. It helps you answer the following questions:3. Be open to feedback and ask for it often:Communication is key. Leave your ego at the door, and ask for feedback with an open mind. When it comes to initial brainstorming and feedback, one tends to ask friends, family and colleagues. Although, useful as a starting point, their opinions could be biased or superficial and influenced by their relationship with you. Therefore, it is imperative that you communicate with direct users of the product for helpful, actionable insights. Ask them what they DON‚ÄôT like.During user interviews, one needs to ask specific questions to the user, so that their feedback gives you insights about specific functionalities of the product. Give them a task to perform using the product and keenly hear and observe their actions.The feedback collected will help you identify areas of the product that need improvement. The ‚Äòfeedback-analyse-iterate-test‚Äô loop should become a core part of your design process.4. Be unbiased about the Digital Product you are designing:This one is easier said than done, but do not fall so in love with what you have created that you are not able to accept any negative critique about it.‚ÄúPeople ignore design that ignores people.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFrank Chimero, DesignerProducts that do not put the user first have a greater chance of failure.Being unbiased and open-minded about one‚Äôs work is a virtue that designers need to strive towards. During user interviews, do not influence the user to give you feedback that favours you and avoid leading questions. Remember, the product has been designed to fulfill the need of the user, and not to satisfy one‚Äôs ego.An empathetic design approach is a business need now, as it helps in providing deeper insights into designing products that are not only good to look at and functional, but also enable and support the end users. Remember to align business goals with the needs of the user. Experience the world through their eyes by stepping into their shoes, understanding their pain-points and work towards filling the gaps to make their life better. Empathy has the power to transform a product that is otherwise lifeless, into a lovable, human-centred experience that users keep coming back to ‚Äì which in the end is great for the business as well.Designfully Yours,Surya Ravindran Pillai",17/03/2019,1,0,9,3,920,572,7,1,0,2,404
"Internet, go the f*ck to sleep!",UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/internet-go-the-fuck-to-sleep-106681a247e5,James Forrest,227,9,1612,"Let me start by explaining the issue. Like so many turn of the century web developers who feel responsible for creating the modern internet, I feel it has gotten away from us. The old school dream of creating the largest network for information exchange has happened, and the implications of it don‚Äôt feel so great. Everyone is fighting with addiction issues, we‚Äôre creating household manifestos for how our children should use it, and we are all at each others throats about our beliefs ‚Äì constantly!When the internet was becoming a phenomenon in the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs it was a really exciting place to be. So many of us were super passionate and proud of the place we were creating. It was different than anything we had ever experienced, it was liberating, seemingly democratic, creative, and free of rules!This platform made a new generation of rock stars ‚Äì ones who created content and experiences in ways that had never been seen before. Like anyone dealing with success (and a captive audience) we created more, and more, and more. The only limits in those days were your skills, creativity, and file sizes.‚Ä¶Now I want to focus a bit more on the last point‚Äî file sizes. This is very important to what I see as the start of the issue we are now facing. Internet speeds were awful ‚Äî we all used modems that offered us, at best, 56k connections which honestly made your worst day on the internet today feel like the fastest connection on the planet. It was bad. Things got progressively better but good data flow wasn‚Äôt a given, and consumption in those days were pretty limited and unpredictable. Often you would start to download a file, leave it overnight, and revisit it the following day ‚Äî this was super frustrating but actually healthy in retrospect. It gave us space so we didn‚Äôt just endlessly consume. Mind you, this was forced on us ‚Äî many of us would have loved to keep consuming the interwebs but we had to stop because the frustration was greater than the payoff.Today we are always connected ‚Äî internet speeds are amazing and the amount of devices we use to connect with are endless. I often see people on planes with their laptop open, tablet next to them watching a movie, and their phone nearby for who knows what. We have reached utopia right?I have recently moved from the U.S. to Denmark ‚Äî a small Scandinavian country known for their Viking past, design, pastries, food movements, and bike culture. Transitioning from an always-on tech life in Boston to a slower, more mindful place has given me a lot to think about ‚Äî what do I miss, what frustrates me, and what can‚Äôt I live without?In the U.S. I took advantage of every tech convenience possible. Amazon, Instacart, Uber, etc. There was never a time when I couldn‚Äôt consume something I wanted and that, in turn, made me feel like I was in control. If it was midnight and I needed toothpaste, I could order it quickly, ‚Äúhey Alexa‚Äù, and it was there the following day.It wasn‚Äôt just tech convenience but also the ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù workforce. Stores close late and open early. Often you can find a 24-hour option for groceries, pharmacies, fast food, etc so if you have insomnia you can always pay a midnight visit to pickup those Pringles you were craving.When I moved to Denmark all of this changed. Stores are really never open ‚Äî at least by American standards. Craving an early breakfast? Well most of the cafes open at 10. Fancy a new outfit ‚Äî you better get there by 6pm on a weekday, 3pm on a Saturday, and just forget it on Sunday ‚Äî everyone is home with their family. This reminded me of a practice at B&H Photo in New York, the great camera store that is closed on the Jewish Sabbath, and the owner decided that even the website will not accept orders from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.‚ÄúThere is, in his mind, something more important than whether or not you can buy a UV filter at 4:30 on a Saturday or have to wait until 8:30 on Saturday,‚Äù says B&H spokesman Henry Posner.Also Amazon was suddenly a real pain since the closest local branch was based out of Germany which meant that I had to wait much longer than expected for delivery and browsing (the fun part, usually) now turned into me uncomfortably reading reviews in German which made it feel much harder and less useful overall. When I finally did decide to order something I usually had delivery issues which involved getting packages delivered to my local supermarket, or Kiosk (corner bodega), since the local Post wouldn‚Äôt just drop a package off if I wasn‚Äôt home ‚Äî not exactly the model of convenience I was used to or wanted.After the initial frustration all of this caused my neurotic American behaviors I started to really appreciate the limits imposed. I save much more money, have lost tons of weight, and spend tons of time with my family ‚Äî not a bad tradeoff IMO.For us in the tech industry we are finally seeing some tools put in place to limit the distraction, since left to our own devices we seemingly cannot control ourselves. Slack for example has implemented a ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù and ‚ÄúSnooze‚Äù mode that will automatically disable notifications while you‚Äôre not working, whereas manually snoozing notifications allows you to disable them on the fly so you can concentrate for intervals of time without the endless barrage of notifications. Slack is the best I‚Äôve seen so far but even they have moved backwards since their first implementation, as they now allow users the ability to override another user settings and effectively ‚Äúdisturb‚Äù them when they asked for peace. Apple also has a Do Not Disturb mode for their products, and Gmail will literally allow you to stop the flow of incoming messages entirely but the problem is they‚Äôre solving the wrong problem.The real issue is the behavior of the users and what each product allows a user to do. This truly is the meat of the issue and where we as practitioners and participants need to focus. Like the B&H example we should applaud businesses who put smart limits on consumption and general use. Just recently at Techfestival in Copenhagen we spoke at a Slow Web summit moderated by Tariq Krim about how venture capitalists asking how many active users a platform has is contributing greatly to bad design of products ‚Äî one where addiction is seen as a positive metric of success. Obviously as a VC you want to fund a product that has lots of users but I think we should also be asking when and to what effect they are using it as well.What if the opposite behavior was rewarded ‚Äî what type of internet could be built then?A while back I asked a bunch of app developers at Intrepid in Cambridge, Massachusetts if I could alter my notifications on a system level. What I wanted to do was design a way for an app user to be able to change the times of day they received notifications and I didn‚Äôt want just a simple on/off switch ‚Äî I wanted granular control like Monday 9am-3pm, etc.The conclusion‚Ä¶ it couldn‚Äôt be done.This is big miss and a huge design pattern that is keeping 2+ billion users from controlling their app usage/addictions properly. It is also keeping valuable messages from reaching them since many users just turn off notifications altogether to just keep sane. If we think we are living in a technologically sophisticated world then maybe we should think again.This distraction and lack of user control issue permeates so many products today. From the auto-play culture of Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify, to flashing kiosks in airports, to GPS navigation in cars. No one is safe from the distraction because remember‚Ä¶ these impressions pay the bills.Many of us seasoned tech folks and other enlightened users have developed ways of dealing with these issues but we are all still struggling. If we are still challenged, what about the rest of the users who are not savvy enough to research ways around this and are still caught in the endless barrage of notifications, noise, and addiction?At the moment I see four towers of responsibility for dealing with this issue.I want to elaborate on the idea of Private Companies, and VCs, helping us all become less addicted. So much of the culture we are living in is derived from what makes investors/shareholders money and if that value system changed so would the internet.Lets consider a few options that could drastically change internet behavior:The internet is truly a positive marvel of our modern society but it is hard to deny that the adoption and impacts of it are becoming increasingly out of sync with the rest of our value systems. Compared to the vision of Tim Berners-Lee and the web 1.0 community we have allowed a few tech giants too much power over our digital destiny in return for the ease of access they have allowed us which is starting to show large consequences.With this said I am not advocating we all unplug and give up on all of this great progress and access we have been given. We just need to hold companies and investors accountable for misuse and greed so we can prevent tech companies from leap frogging our value systems at a pace society cannot keep up with, which has clearly led to the addiction and abuse we are seeing now due to the lack of understanding and regulation.",17/03/2019,3,0,13,10,1036,870,6,2,0,13,372
Design Sprint in the daily design process ‚Äî one-man(woman) wolfpack,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/design-sprint-in-the-daily-design-process-one-man-woman-wolfpack-a510424eda2b,Vildana Lojo Babiƒá,62,7,878,"In the first part of the Design Sprint in the daily design process ‚Äî methodology & history I wrote about the Design Thinking as methodology and Design Sprint as its framework. For the second part, I would like to answer a question:How could Design Sprint be applied to the everyday design process and to a single designer?Of course, not all exercises or phases from the Design Sprint will be suitable at any moment in your everyday professional routine, but getting inspired and applying specific Design Sprint elements can be very beneficial.Here are a couple of examples on when Design Sprint could become a great source for inspiration:At one point in my career, I got the opportunity to create a pitch proposal for a new eBanking solution. I was the only designer on a team with a tight deadline. Since there were approximatively five days to prepare the concept, I asked myself a question: ‚ÄúShould I try to get inspired by Design Sprint to organize time and utilize its methods?‚ÄùSo, I did.Since conducting by-the-book Design Sprint with all relevant stakeholders was not a viable option at that time, I started planning how one-member design sprint could look like. A couple of hours later, this is how I organized the timeline and prepared the pitch:This day was scheduled for:Comparison to Design Sprint: This day mostly aligned with the Sprint Phases 1 and 2. The difference is that during the ‚Äúby-the-book‚Äù Design Sprint each team member is physically present on this day.Since I did not have the setting, I decided to interview the clients remotely and tried to ask them all relevant questions that could help during this process.Also, comparative market analysis exercise was added to this day in order to have better insight into the customer segment and users.This day was scheduled for:Comparison to Design Sprint: This day aligned with the Sprint Phases 2, 3 and 4.Defining the long term goal, writing ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù questions and targeting the most important sprint challenges was very helpful. Even though I was a one-person team this kept me focused on the main idea during the entire process.I would like to note that, while defining standout features at this phase might seem one step ahead, it was crucial to address them. These features were mentioned in the initial brief, and it was very important to validate them.The main focus of this day was to sketch and explore as many ideas possible and as one person can generate.This exercise is a core part of a Design Sprint and I must confess it is much more prolific when you have more team members. You can generate more ideas and see other perspectives when working in a group, but it does not mean that you cannot create interesting and unique ideas when working alone.By the end of the day, I compared the sketched solutions with information gathered from the client interviews and research and decided which solution would be most suitable for this pitch.Deciding on a solution is the trickiest activity to do when you are working alone since it is intended to be decision-making exercise with main stakeholders and deciders involved. And, to us designers, it is very challenging not to favor one specific concept.This day was scheduled for:Comparison to Design Sprint: This day aligned with Phase 5 of a Design Sprint. The focus was on creating detailed wireframes and preparation of the assumptions that will be tested with users.The resources for detailed user testing were limited, but I decided to do as much as possible by recruiting a couple of persons that fit the user profile and to ask them to complete the remote test after which we had a small interview.This day was scheduled for:Comparison to Design Sprint: This day aligned with Phase 6 of a Design Sprint. User testing was prepared and done during this day. After testing sessions, I started preparing the results, key takeaways, next steps suggestions and making smaller iterations to the proposed solution.This day was scheduled for:Day 5 in comparison to Design Sprint: This day aligned with Phase 6 of a Design Sprint with additional activities such as UI design.Usually, UI design is not part of a Design Sprint but since this was a pitch proposal I decided to go one step further and create a couple of screens in high fidelity to present the solution in a way that is easier for different stakeholders to comprehend.To me, the experiment was extremely interesting and provided me with better insights on how daily design routine could be organized. But, there are many variables that need to be considered when applying Design Sprint framework or let‚Äôs say mindset into your daily design routine:At the end of the day, this story is an example of how to get inspired and integrate Design Thinking methods and Design Sprint with a positive outcome to a daily design routine. On the other hand, each person is different and maybe this would not work but something different would. I would love to hear your thoughts and your personal experience with Design Thinking or Design Sprint.You can find Design Sprint in Daily Design Process Pt. 1 ‚Äî Methodology & History hereVildana is experienced UX/UI and Product Designer, Master of Architecture and Urban Planning, currently working with ",17/03/2019,2,0,19,11,993,461,5,7,0,7,281
How to Hack Your Way into Online Success. (NOT.),The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-hack-your-way-into-online-success-not-ea8531700b18,Shaunta Grimes,40000,8,1590,"In 2013 I did the one thing that I‚Äôve dreamed of for as long as I can remember.I walked into a Barnes and Noble with my family to gawk at my book on the shelf.An imprint of Penguin published my novel Viral Nation in 2013 and its sequel, Rebel Nation in 2014.The day I walked into the same Barnes and Noble to gaze in wonder at my second book on the shelf ‚Äî and realized it wasn‚Äôt there ‚Äî was another day that will be etched in my memory forever.My local Barnes and Noble didn‚Äôt pick up Rebel Nation. My publisher didn‚Äôt pick up the third book in the series. In 2014, my whole career to that point consisted of two thirds of a trilogy that would never be finished by a traditional publisher.It took me about 18 months to recover from that blow. I‚Äôm not going to lie: it sucked. I lost my mojo. My muse took an extended vacation.When my advance ran out, I got a job at my local school district and seriously contemplated doing the one thing I‚Äôd resisted all of my adult life.I almost became a classroom teacher.Obviously, there is nothing wrong with being a classroom teacher. But for me? It has always represented my plan B. It has always been the thing I‚Äôll do if I can‚Äôt make it as a writer.In fact, I came so close that I scared myself. That scare knocked some of the cobwebs off of my muse or something, because in November of 2015, I started writing again.Instead of writing as a creative expression of my art, this time I wrote because I hated my day job and selling another book was the only thing I could think of that would bring in enough money to let me quit. It was a bad job.I mean really, really bad.I loved the kids, but the teacher was a burnout and she hated me.It was so bad that my co-workers were secretly giving me pep talks to try to help me just go ahead and quit already.So bad that the principal gave me tips for other schools that were hiring.Only I couldn‚Äôt just walk away, because I wasn‚Äôt working for my health. I needed the pay check.I knew that something had to give. I took the spaghetti approach and just threw everything at the wall, hoping something would stick.I applied for open positions at other schools and for any other job Craig‚Äôs List offered up. I also polished up a manuscript that I‚Äôd abandoned on that awful day at Barnes and Noble, and I sent it out on submission to agents.I‚Äôd talk about telling stories, maybe teach a little as a way of trying to convince people to read what I was putting down.I was hired at a new school a month later, which relieved a ton of the pressure. Now I just had a regular old day job, instead of a toxic dump day job. Progress.I‚Äôd already started this ball rolling, though, so my first goal was to see if I could convince 50 people to trade their email addresses for a free class called The Plotting Workshop.I‚Äôd given away 900 spots in my free class. Ninja Writers had become a thing and it was taking on a life of its own.I was also getting this incredible feedback from the people taking my class.I‚Äôd had an idea brewing for ages about an intense year-long course where I‚Äôd take people through every stage of writing a novel. In real time. They‚Äôd leave my class with their own novel written, spit-shined, and ready to send out into the world.One day in late February, I made a sales page on Gumroad and emailed the link to my brand-spanking new list. I clicked ‚Äòsend‚Äô and then went to a movie with my husband.I thought either people would respond to my idea or they‚Äôd ignore it and I‚Äôd just take down the sales page and pretend it never happened.When I came out of the theater, I‚Äôd sold two spots and earned $750. That was more than half of my monthly take home pay at the job from the black lagoon.By the end of March I‚Äôd sold more than 100 spots in my year-long course. I‚Äôd earned twice as much as I make in a year as a teacher‚Äôs assistant. My mailing list had doubled. My Facebook group was thriving and wildly fun.Everyone talks about hacks and tricks and short cuts. I don‚Äôt think any of them work. Not really. And definitely not anymore. (Maybe they did once, in the infancy of writing online. But not today.)I thought I‚Äôd share with you a few things that I think did make a difference during this weird, whirl-wind of an adventure.These are tools that I think still work today.Usually the goal in blogging is to get as many people to to visit your site in a single day as possible.Until Ninja Writers, that was always the metric I tracked.Pinterest strategies and Facebook ads. Tweets and Instagram pics. All of it dedicated to drawing page views.This time was different. I had something I wanted to give to my readers, and that went way beyond a blog post.I needed to be able to connect with them and email has been the key.Because the best way to build an email list is to give things to people and to offer amazing service, this shift in focus has made me a better writer and a better teacher.A lead magnet or opt-in freebie is the thing that a blogger gives away for free in exchange for an email address.Some people give away a checklist or a short ebook.I gave away an 8-week course that included everything I know about how to plan a novel.It was actually harder than you might expect to be that generous. People are iffy about committing to something like that when they don‚Äôt know the person they are taking it from.So I came up with a much smaller opt-in ‚Äî and then I gave the class away for free once people got to know me a little better.In fact, when someone signs up for my email list, they get a series of emails over the course of a couple of months that gives them every single tool I use myself when I‚Äôm writing a book.It‚Äôs my goal to help as many writers as I possibly can. I do need to earn a living along the way, but mostly because it‚Äôs the only way I can stop being torn away from this thing for seven hours a day to go be a teacher‚Äôs assistant so I can pay my rent and feed my kids.When I started Ninja Writers, I had one goal: to reduce the suck of being stuck in a day job that was absolute misery. I actually got myself out of the toxic job a more traditional way. I found a much more pleasant place to trade my time for money.But when I started my website, when I launched my course, when I started writing again ‚Äî those were all in an attempt to do something drastic. I didn‚Äôt want my life to just suck less, I wanted to be a full-time writer again.I needed a big change and I was willing to risk rejection and failure to get it.I took the go-big-or-go-home approach, because I didn‚Äôt feel like I had anything to lose. I put everything I know about writing into one course and then hoped that some people would want to learn what I wanted to teach.And if they didn‚Äôt, I was okay with being embarrassed. I was okay with putting my tail between my legs and crawling back to the drawing board.I think this is the most important thing I did.When I thought about who I was writing for, I realized that it was me.Middle-aged me who had already been published, but was struggling with a set-back. But also, twenty-year-old me who really wanted to do something that felt overwhelmingly big.Ninja Writers is the writing community that I‚Äôve been craving all of my life. It‚Äôs three years old now and the people in it have formed this bond that‚Äôs so amazing to be part of.When someone new joins and posts a hello message, by the time I see it a bunch of Ninjas have already welcomed them to the family.That‚Äôs what they write: Welcome to the family.I belong to a lot of Facebook groups, but I‚Äôve never been part of one as engaged and incredible as Ninja Writers.I‚Äôm teaching the kind of classes that I would have loved to have found when I was a new writer. Ninja Writers has changed my life, but it would have been truly epic to find something like it when I was much younger.I truly believe that one person with a story to tell and the ability to tell it well can change the world. Ninja Writers lets me encourage writers to slow down and learn to write well, so that their work can become the story that changes the world for someone else.There really isn‚Äôt anything more exciting than that.Not even the fact that thanks to the Ninja Writers, I get to be a full-time writer again ‚Äî and a teacher on my own terms.Here‚Äôs my secret weapon for sticking with whatever your thing is.Shaunta Grimes is a writer and teacher. She lives in Reno with her husband, three superstar kids, and a yellow rescue dog named Maybelline Scout. She‚Äôs on Twitter @shauntagrimes and is the original Ninja Writer.",17/03/2019,4,0,1,11,1050,268,3,0,0,9,1700
On the Narrative of Trust,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/on-the-narrative-of-trust-1699ec343e43,Johan Liedgren,100,9,1877,"On November 2nd of 2018, Wells Fargo argued in response to a Federal class action lawsuit that ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt sue us because you should have known we mislead you‚Äù. This highlights the paradoxical trust relationship we have with entities and things that are more than just tools, but still so much less than human. What does it mean to trust a corporation? Trust them to do what? The same question grows deeper with increasingly adaptive AI based technology playing an active part in our day-to-day lives. We need a new language to better capture what actually matters: the problem we solve together.Trusting based on predictability, could be compared to trusting a tree in a park. It is indeed very likely that the tree will be there tomorrow. But that isn‚Äôt meaningful trust. Conversely, if a friend told you that they really, really trust Wells Fargo, Facebook or AT&T, you would buy them a drink and check in to see that they haven‚Äôt lost their mind.‚ÄúHey, Siri ‚Äî Can I Trust You?‚ÄùTrust becomes increasingly meaningless when we consider AI based technology where the myriad of interconnected mechanics of utility are pushed away from our visibility. It is adaptive to us in the moment, and over time shares history with us. This is far more than simple repeatable tasks as we relate to its behavior based not on actions, but what we think it is trying to do. Much like humans, we judge them based on stated and inferred intent.It is not just how we think that sophisticated technology or a corporation is trying to to serve us that matters. We also know that each such action is brokered with self interests such as wanting us to buy more, stay on the platform or divert our attention to ads etc. In addition, if we consider dialogue based interfaces such as Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, our judgement adds another dimension. AI-based assistants aren‚Äôt necessarily more complicated per se, but as we tend to deduce more intent from voice than we do from words and visuals, the trust and relationship we build is likely colored by personality to an even higher degree.Why Are You Being So Nice to Me?What we see and infer as intent is the key to relationships and the trust we build. But what is designed by a corporation to appear as intent isn‚Äôt necessarily useful in this limited context for two reasons: first, we know that their ultimate and primary goal is to make money. Nothing else really matters when push comes to show. Secondly, we know that intent was into a system that is unable to offer actual empathy. We are aware that their displayed intent to serve us ‚Äî no matter how well and how complex ‚Äî is only there to serve corporate interests.Can our interest and corporate interests be overlapping? Yes, of course. We don‚Äôt expect anything for free. When we pay for a service done well, things are relatively easy. But most often it is not: Google will do search well for us, but makes money from ads. Often one Google-experience is competing with the other. And ‚Äî to take an even more extreme example ‚Äî when British Petroleum pays for exhibits at the Tate Gallery in London, we might at the surface encounter the very opposite to Wells Fargo‚Äôs legal claim, yet end up with the exact same question: trust them, to do what?Fictional Events Create Very Real EmotionsIn a 1923, German philosopher Martin Buber wrote the essay ‚ÄúI and Thou‚Äù where he suggests dividing our relationship to the world into two distinct categories: ‚ÄúThings‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù. Relationships to things are utilitarian and finite. A relationship with a person on the other hand, is infinite. Are we stuck in this deeply limiting dichotomy relating to the world as either a thing, or a person?Let‚Äôs consider another option that fits right in-between person and thing: story. When we engage with stories and narrative, we deploy imagination, emotions, and aspects of trust in very meaningful ways. Yet it is distinctly different in quality to what we offer both things or actual people. In story, we give ourself over to a narrative, live out in a different reality. We suspend disbelief: trusting the story enough to let the immediate reality and status quo fade away to make cognitive room for a new possibilities. We ‚Äútrust‚Äù story to do all this in part because we know it is not true.The stakes in fiction are different than in any real-world situation. We won‚Äôt run the risk of dying by watching a war film, no matter how grizzly. Nor will we get pregnant, no matter how steamy the novel. Still, fictional events do create very real emotions. Fiction and art will as a result will have us imagine, think, re-evaluate what is possible for ourselves and the world we live in. It can suggest new ways to view and live. And with that, the emotions created and possibilities imagined in the story will on a good day spur new thought, a change in views and inspire very real action in a very real world.A Narrative Framework for TrustCompanies, organizations and products care about ‚Äútrust‚Äù because they want something from us. It is usually loyalty, repeat behavior and enough suspension of disbelief to exempt them from a too rational view of what they do. Story is well suited to give simple things elevated meaning. Story contextualizes to offer purpose and direction by showing how something plays part in something bigger outside itself, and why that matters.Similarly, story as a model can explore more meaningful aspects of our relationship to corporations and AI-based technology, while avoiding the limitations of forced comparisons to either living people or simple and static objects. If we lay bare the essential building-blocks of story and narrative, we can find a framework for discussing trust that captures what story already does so well.When we can articulate how something plays with the three story-story-element above, we have the basis for a meaningful relationship and a foundation for trust. Not because a corporation asks us to trust them, or because a smart-product acts in a specific way to pander to our archetypes. With story, our relationship is not directly to the tangible, but how a specific utility together with us play part in addressing a bigger problem or conflict. It that story that gives purpose and direction, and that we know how to evaluate, relate to and potentially trust. It answers the bigger question head on: trust to do what? And to what end? In story, the problem is the solution. And a narrow focus on a solution is usually the problem.Death and Break-up SexMost experiences we design or build will not have built in endings. An ending is not desired. If the story is over, we will lose the relationship and any reason to continue engagement. Instead, we build experiences hoping they lead to yet another experience. Desire ‚Äî not satiation ‚Äî is what pushes from one experience to the next. There are only two experiences defined solely as final experiences; death and break-up sex. If they don‚Äôt end up as final, they become something entirely different. All other experiences aim beyond themselves. So, how do we handle the requirements for a good ending of the story per above if there is none?We are helped here by making a distinction between ‚Äústory‚Äù and ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. Story we can decide has a defined ending. When someone tells you a story, you expect them to know how it ends. In a narrative, however, the ending is open: we know what the conflict is and what is in play. We just don‚Äôt know exactly how things will play out, yet. But since we engage with both story and narrative before we know the ending, both require the same for us to engage: a conflict and stakes that is meaningful, room for us to make a difference. And lastly, the promise of a journey that delivers both the inevitable and the surprising.Narrative is a PuzzleInstead of asking customers to trust what cannot actually be trusted in a meaningful way, or highlighting charity ploys unrelated to the core business, we contextualize the relationship as narrative. The core elements of story get adjusted to fit a product, a product gets upgraded to highlight the narrative. And now more important than empty talk about ‚Äúcustomer focus‚Äù, the question is not how to pander to market desires but what role the client has in a specific narrative. And what role the product or company has in that same narrative.A company or institution telling you they can‚Äôt do it alone builds a real relationship. Neither you nor they need to be perfect to compliment each other and work to address the issue. You are participating in something bigger than both of you. And you do this Together. Dependency is an expedient relationship builder.‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù is Always the Right Question?Perhaps most important in this narrative framework is how it shifts focus towards the conflict: why does any of this matter at all? It directs us away from shiny new things and promises of vague tag-lines that are sure to lack the existential fiber to muster up any real purpose. Humans through evolution are master narrative bullshit detectors if we are given the relevant information. If we are not given the information, we don‚Äôt engage. The narrative framework will ensure that the story-puzzle fits together efficiently, and that the story is something we find worth playing a part in.It is important to note that story will done right will not let itself be a corporate lap-dog. It will not act as a spin and get-out-of-jail card for insincere organizations. The very nature of narrative, when done right, keeps the discussion honest as it will shine a light on how problems and solutions play together. Just like fictional story, it is allergic to pandering and can‚Äôt wait to pounce on posturing. It shuns the petty and the self-serving. It self-regulates: if the conflict and the stakes aren‚Äôt truly important to us, high enough, urgent enough‚Ä¶ then we don‚Äôt find the narrative interesting, and we don‚Äôt engage. And if the product offered in this context isn‚Äôt really relevant or truly unique in solving the bigger problem, it very quickly becomes obvious. You can lie about facts, but you can‚Äôt fake a great narrative.The Problem is the SolutionThe central question for story seeking an audience is always ‚Äúwhy it matters‚Äù. A narrative framework outside fiction will force a similar discussion. Trust is placed in the narrative that we chose to participate in, not the corporation or product. We trust where we are going enough to place one old narrative on hold to try a new one. Not because we are told so, but because we know why and we chose to.The very nature of good story is to hint at a more interesting world on the other side of status quo. If the story can‚Äôt promise that, we are stuck where we started: wondering how we ended up disappointed with Wells Fargo. And that‚Äôs just a sad and predictable story where a great narrative could be had._________________________________________________________________For more articles in this series on Story and Narrative as Tool, please see : https://medium.com/@johan_liedgren",17/03/2019,0,0,13,15,1050,442,1,1,0,1,130
The curious case of toilet paper and facial recognition,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/the-curious-case-of-toilet-paper-and-facial-recognition-c204c701fd0f,Jenny Lin,11,5,1051,"There are so many fascinating things about how technology is incorporated into Chinese society like the influence of WeChat, e-bikes, and its cashless economy. Unfortunately, this article isn‚Äôt going to be about any of those things; it‚Äôs going to be about toilet paper. Why? Because earlier this year my face was scanned by an automated toilet paper dispenser and I can‚Äôt get over it. This isn‚Äôt an episode of Black Mirror, it‚Äôs real life.China has a problem with toilet paper; it gets stolen all the time. It‚Äôs so bad that most public bathrooms don‚Äôt bother providing it anymore. That‚Äôs why, in Chinese culture ‚Äî the part that no one ever talks about because it‚Äôs too real ‚Äî you‚Äôre expected to carry your own in the form of travel tissue packs (readily available in every supermarket and convenience store, üòâ). However, China‚Äôs tourism industry is rising and since the bathroom part of Chinese culture isn‚Äôt the proudest or the most sanitary, toilet paper is starting to make a comeback to meet tourist expectations. Currently select parks, attractions, and other high traffic areas have been graced with automated (via facial recognition) toilet paper dispensers and it‚Äôs quite a sight to be seen. So if you‚Äôre interested in Chinese culture, inclusive design, or curious about why toilet paper‚Äôs such a big deal, please keep on reading.In order to fully understand why China‚Äôs investing in high tech for a low tech product, there are two things to keep in mind. 1: Public toilet paper gets stolen worldwide, but since China makes up about 20% of the world‚Äôs population, there‚Äôs a lot of paper at stake. 2: The reason why it gets stolen is a reflection of China‚Äôs socio-economic history over the past century; we‚Äôre talking about extreme poverty and lack of education. That changed dramatically in the late 1970s when the government placed economic reforms that have almost entirely erased urban poverty. Right now, toilet paper thieves are generally from older generations who grew up in poverty and people who are currently facing poverty, particularly migrant workers from rural areas.I was really excited when I found out about these dispensers. It was early January and I was with my Aunt in Zuohai Park, Fuzhou when she casually mentioned that there were new machines for toilet paper. I had to try them. In this particular park, there were two dispensers at the entrance of the bathroom and I happily stood in front of one. I made sure my face was in the camera‚Äôs frame, stared at it for three seconds, and like magic, a two foot portion of toilet paper came out. Perfect.Right behind me in line was an older gentlemen. He also stared at the camera for three seconds but this time the camera couldn‚Äôt register his face. He tried to bend down, arch his back, move in closer, then farther away but nothing worked. At one point, a friendly stranger that came out from the bathroom tried to help him by using his own face, but the dispenser politely declined him in Mandarin Chinese because he apparently already received his portion and couldn‚Äôt get more! At this point, a realization came over me and at once I felt uncomfortable and slightly amused. I mean, isn‚Äôt it both hilarious and scary when a machine recognizes your face and denies you toilet paper? I moved in closer to investigate the older gentleman‚Äôs interaction with the dispenser. I noticed that towards the end of his attempt, there was a huge shadow across his face from the overcast since we were in an indoor/outdoor location, making him undetectable to the camera. He eventually gave up.If executed properly, facial recognition and other biometric recognition systems could serve as great opportunities of inclusive design. From my personal experience, the type of toilet paper dispenser I interacted with could definitely be more effective and efficient. Let‚Äôs breakdown the good and the bad:The Pros:1. Free. The design successfully allows public bathrooms to provide free toilet paper without having to worry about theft. This is already a win considering many places don‚Äôt provide toilet paper at all.2. Environmentally friendly. It saves paper since it‚Äôs portioned and won‚Äôt allow an individual to take more than one portion within a nine minute interval.3. It‚Äôs hygienic. Utilizing facial recognition means that people don‚Äôt have to touch the dispenser in order to activate it.The Cons:1. Waiting on line. There were two dispensers at the bathroom entrance in Zuohai Park. That means people have to wait on line to get toilet paper before even entering the gender divided individual stalls. (Added Pro: At least the dispenser lines are genderless.)2. Uncontrolled variables. Not all public bathrooms are designed for facial recognition technology to work. If the only free wall space for dispensers is near the entrance of an outdoor bathroom and the camera can‚Äôt pick up someone‚Äôs face because of uncontrollable variables like the weather and amount of daylight, that‚Äôs a problem.3. Is it even enough? Some people need more than two feet of toilet paper. I‚Äôll leave it at that.4. Height. If someone‚Äôs a lot taller than the dispenser, on crutches, or has a leg injury, that person is going to struggle with getting their face into frame. On the opposite end, if someone‚Äôs shorter, in a wheelchair, etc. and can‚Äôt even reach the camera, there‚Äôs no way that person can get toilet paper without human assistance.5. Language. For a machine that‚Äôs meant to be used in high traffic tourist areas, it would be beneficial if there was at least an English translation and braille under every Chinese instruction and signage near and on the dispenser, including the actual interface. The dispenser also only speaks in Mandarin Chinese.6. Privacy. This is more than just a toilet paper dispenser. As much as it‚Äôs reducing theft and waste, it‚Äôs also monitoring the public and capturing faces for China‚Äôs giant facial recognition database.So what happens if the dispenser isn‚Äôt working or if you refuse to have your face scanned but still need toilet paper? The good news is that conveniently right next to the main automated toilet paper dispenser is a mini toilet paper dispenser, and all you have to do for this one is scan your WeChat QR code.Hi, my name‚Äôs Jenny Lin.I‚Äôm a UX Designer based in New York.",17/03/2019,1,0,12,19,1050,1137,4,0,0,1,94
How AI will drive profitability in Micro-mobility,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/how-ai-will-drive-profitability-in-micro-mobility-6f8618483ad0,Alexandre Gonfalonieri,4400,9,1716,"Driven by a passion for AI and micro-mobility solutions, we wanted to write an article related to AI adoption within the micro-mobility industry whose influence keeps rising in our cities. Thanks to our experience at ofo, Mobike and within several AI departments (Global brands and Consulting firms), we wrote this article.AI solutions need to address specific challenges. Through our experience, we have seen that this market is quite unique because of its nature (explosion of data available, the number of competitors, etc.). The main risk is for micro-mobility players to end up using generic solutions that don‚Äôt really help them to create a unique competitive advantage.One of the key aspects of running a micro-mobility service is fleet management.Indeed, your business model is based on your ability to control your fleet and maintain low running costs. In the last years, AI experts have been busy trying to develop an advanced business dashboard.Indeed, it becomes more and more complicated to manage a fleet based on the complexity of the urban environment and flows of travelers combined with the number of competitors. As a consequence, bike sharing operators want to gain insights from data and make not only faster decisions but mostly smarter ones based on customer behaviors, demand forecast, and external factors.The tricky part is not to create an AI-powered dashboard but rather a tailor-made solution that was built in collaboration with both data scientists and experts in micro-mobility.This combination will give birth to relevant and unique performance indicators that will back operational decisions and strategies thanks to features such as heat maps to improve relocation and rebalancing of the fleet (to match offer with demand) of potentially different type of vehicles for different types of use at different period of the day, etc.This combination is made mandatory by the nature of AI. Indeed, it requires a data strategy (which data will we use? is it available? how will we gather the necessary data? do we have the right to leverage this data? etc.). Moreover, it is about training the AI and feeding it to achieve the results you envision.The data management (creation of a data set) will require people, time and effort that have to be planned and monitored. The good news is that most micro-mobility companies are heavily tech-oriented and by nature very adaptable to new processes which are perfect to create an AI culture within the company.AI is still mostly about experiments and prototypes in the micro-mobility market.Most startups in this industry share the same concern‚Ä¶ how to find the best operational model.The cost structure in this industry is crucial and it becomes even more important to manage it as you grow. Micro-mobility startups think global and in order to tackle new markets, they spend a lot of time in building the best operating model that can easily be applied in new cities. AI will tremendously help micro-mobility startups when it comes to growth in new markets. Indeed, micro-mobility companies will make fewer mistakes and adapt their strategy faster to meet profits.From an operational point of view, the challenge is huge. Basically, you are trying to keep control of your resources while delivering the best possible service to your customers:Needless to say, it requires a lot of data analysis and visibility into the operations to provide high-level service.Through data, micro-mobility startups can finally fully understand how their products are being used. In an industry driven by competition, the customer experience is everything. An e-bike that is broken will immediately impact the customer experience. In other words, micro-mobility players cannot grow in a competitive market if they are consistently facing poor ridership or spend too many resources on the management of their assets and renewal.Based on our experience, through data made available by city administrations and AI technology (Machine Learning mostly), startups can track their fleet, its usage and better anticipate demand. It enables operators to optimize internal processes to efficiently rebalance, recharge and manage their bikes and scooters.In order to understand profitability in the micro-mobility industry, it is key to have in mind that it can be impacted by many factors.We intend to use AI for :Other applications are possible but these are the ones we expect to see in the next 5 years.When it comes to prediction, AI can give micro-mobility companies the ability to predict rider patterns so that they can improve the availability of bikes at the right locations. We have noticed that one of the most costly challenges in the industry is the redistribution of bikes/scooters across a city. Through AI, it becomes possible to ensure that bikes are available where they are needed, and docks are free when a customer needs them.Micro-mobility can be heavily influenced by external factors such as weather, events, and holidays. by converting this information into data, we can predict demand and adapt bike/scooter availability.When it comes to rebalancing, a question remains: how can we ensure a large offer in the whole city meanwhile focusing on most dynamic locations. In other terms, how can we generate the maximum of cash while satisfying a maximum of users?First, a quick definition for those who might ask what rebalancing is: technical word to describes the repositioning and pick up procss of bikes and e scooters throughout the city once night falls. Drivers pick up bikes or e scooters damaged to repair it (if possible) and rebalance new or repaired one in the night. Juicers only focus on recharging at home e scooters and ¬´ rebalance ¬ª it all over the city by a group of 3 up to 6, sometimes 7 units.But how can AI optimize this process, make it efficient, always cheaper and quicker?The first role of AI could be preventive. Yes, preventive. Let‚Äôs take the example of the micro-mobility most promising city, Paris. This past 5 months, the city has been going through some big troubles with the ¬´ Gilets Jaunes ¬ª movement. Shops, cars, scooters and mainly e scooters have been broken or burned. As each e scooter costs roughly from 400$ up to 500- 600$ taking in count the shipping from its production country, a burned e scooter has a bigger impact for Lime Bike or Bird, that you might think.AI could help prevent all the events in a city while crossing internal data, newspapers, TV news, and police official release for instance. As long as we can leverage both internal and external data (open data culture, APIs, etc.).Conversely, artificial intelligence could help operational managers make strategic decisions in order to better target crowded areas. All year long, special events take place, such as music festivals, the sleepless night, the carless day in Paris, leading to big movements of people and existing users.By feeding an IA with data from newspapers, open data and figures on the number of people expected, this special events could be automatized and would allow micro-mobility actors to be really accurate on their deployment and operational actions.Last but not least is the target per neighborhood. Having data on the movement of people within a neighborhood, purchasing power, if inhabitants are mostly families or student, is important information. It could help to target users geographically and propose a very accurate offer.But optimizing operations and deploy bikes/e scooters on always more accurate locations is tricky. It is really easy to misunderstand what is relevant from what is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, which is really helpful versus what won‚Äôt have a real impact on usage. All the work of operations managers is being neutral in this exercise, to separate personal fears or preconceptions from reality.The perfect AI-powered AppFor operational agents, the perfect application would look like as follow.An AI-powered application that can help the agent understand how many bikes should be dispatched depending on the moment of the day at specific moments of the day and places, what road to take to efficiently pick up a specific type of bike across the city, etc. The entire process should be enhanced with the help of an AI that can understand the current demand and perpetually adjust its forecast in real-time.SourceDue to the movements of customers according to their personal needs, there is often more or fewer than the required number of bikes at base stations.Some AI experts have been working on a novel spatial-temporal bike rebalancing framework, and model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that aims at maximizing the service level. By using the hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that decides how to pay different users at each time, to incentivize them to help rebalance the system.Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL): a promising approach to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve more complex tasks.Enhanced crowdsourcing mechanism through AI that incentivizes the users in the bike repositioning process is something that will change the industry. Some experts have designed design architecture of the incentives system which employs optimal pricing policies using the approach of regret minimization in online learning.Another crucial aspect of every micro-mobility company lies in the customer mobile app. Through AI, we can identify the most dangerous zones on the road and then work out a solution to share this data with cyclists and then motorists.We predict that the role of Apps within the customer journey will increase through AI.Indeed, micro-mobility brands will probably start leveraging machine learning and Natural Language Processing to figure out the preferences of users and offer recommendations for extra services they may like. They might also enhance the reporting aspect of the App by helping users to cut through the clutter of information and deliver tailored-made recommendations based on their data.The use of IoT and smart captors combined with AI is already impacting several industries such as the railway industry. It is safe to assume that micro-mobility will also start benefiting from these solutions.A scooter equipped with smart sensors could gather data about the level of wear on the scooter components and predict when a scooter will need maintenance based on how customers are using it. This would help companies in anticipating maintenance costs.Fully-Integrated predictive maintenance for a micro-mobility product could look like this:AI will profoundly improve existing operations and help companies better control their costs structure while delivering better customer experience. We are only at the beginning of this AI journey for most micro-mobility players.This article was written with the help of Alban Sirou and Hector Drawin.",17/03/2019,3,0,11,8,988,499,8,1,0,9,374
Safe exploration in complex B2B applications,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/safe-exploration-in-complex-b2b-applications-f209f09d643f,Matth√§us Niedoba,130,5,875,"Enterprise applications are complex. It takes time to understand how they work and even longer to master them. Employees are constantly learning new systems or applications. This happens during a reorganization of a company involving new IT systems or an onboarding process after changing the job. Learning new systems and workflows costs a lot of cognitive load, stress and frustration. To make an employee‚Äôs life easier, applications should allow Safe Exploration.Safe exploration allows one to learn the application without having the fear of breaking something. It‚Äôs the learning by doing principle which is way more effective than studying with tutorial videos or reading manuals. Safe Exploration deals with ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. What if the user makes a mistake? Can he go back? It helps users to create the right expectations and helps them to imagine: ‚ÄúWhen I click on this button, I expect‚Ä¶‚Äù And most importantly, it teaches the user how to use the app. Enterprise applications are rigid and interaction concepts (once they are established in the beginning) will never change. Luckily, there are ways to add Safe Exploration on top.The Undo feature is the basic command of every content creating app. It‚Äôs the big advantage why people prefer computers instead of working the analog way. If the user makes a mistake, he can always go back. It removes the fear of breaking something and provides confidence to try out features.Even if it seems like a no-brainer, there are some hidden behaviors involved. Undo is not just stepping back every action the user created. It should be limited to changes on the work. Changing application settings is not part of Undo. Furthermore, Undo groups actions in meaningful chunks. For example, in Microsoft Word users are typing letters, but undo affects whole words. It even affects changes made by the computer like capitalizing the first letter of a paragraph.Limited to desktop applications, hovering is an easy to implement feature. It supports safe exploration, because the user does not evoke a command which would make changes to his work, but the visual indications create certain expectations to the feature. They can be a change to the cursor or highlighting of certain interface elements, like buttons or handles. It can also evoke tooltips, which we will cover next.Safe Exploration educates the user directly in the application and avoids switching to an external resource like a PDF manual or a website. Tooltips play an important role here, because they are a simple way of explaining features. The cursor stays on an interactive element (ideally highlighted by a different hover state) and a message appears. This message can pop up next to the cursor or in a dedicated application area. If it‚Äôs placed next to the cursor, it will be easily recognized by the user. The message should be minimal. The drawback here is that it only appears after a certain delay, when the cursor is not moving. Chances are high that users will never face them. Sometimes it helps to add illustration and animation in tooltips, but it can be quickly annoying. Users will associate them with pop up ads.If it‚Äôs located at a dedicated place in the UI, they can respond instantly when the user moves the mouse. The tooltip mechanism could be extended to anything visible in the UI and doesn‚Äôt need to be limited to tools. A folding mechanism should minimize them if the user needs the screen space for other interface elements. Ableton Live is a good example here.An interactive tour is valuable when people open the application for the first time. A good tour should not only explain the features of an application but guide the user through a demo project. At the end the user should have a finished project where multiple areas of the application have been touched. For example, exploring a video application is based on a small demo project examining multiple areas like file importing, cutting, color grading and sound editing. The user will then get an understanding of context and can then dive deeper into each area.Specifically for actions which are not able to be undone, confirmation dialogues are necessary. They add friction to the human computer interaction by making the user think, before submitting an action. Whether it‚Äôs the Drunk Mode for the iPhone, the classical ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù dialogue box or a confirmation button in an online shop or banking application, they all provide a sense of security. A good confirmation dialogue explains what will happen when the user confirms the action. Its visual design needs to be vivid using contrast and color coding to highlight the impact of the action.All the aforementioned elements can be designed and implemented without changing the foundation of a complex application. They are a layer of usability on top. Like most UX features, they are not noticeable, but make a huge impact whether users like an application or not.Users are busy. They don‚Äôt want to read manuals or watch hours of video tutorials. They just want their work done. Education in the application has the same importance as intuitive design. Safe Exploration supports that.If you found this article valuable, press the clap button so others can find it.

"Do Less, Better",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/do-less-better-ade1e3815e83,Manj Bahra,4700,7,1387,"I recently was given a massive increase in responsibility at work. Aside from needing to learn a new set of skills rapidly, I have more tasks to complete daily than ever before. This fresh challenge has driven me to scour the research on productivity religiously, with the specific aim of finding what works for me. I‚Äôm not interested in theory ‚Äî I need results.Everyone wants to make out there is a magic pill for productivity. We see companies advertising brain supplements, gurus suggesting methodologies, and click-bait articles suggesting the top 5 things you can do to be productive. The unfortunate and liberating truth, as proven time and time again by science, is that you need to focus on doing less, better.I needed answers because my approach wasn‚Äôt working. I need to write requirements for three projects, provide subject expertise to our developers, chase outstanding issues, and run meetings. Initially, I tried to do everything at once ‚Äî check mail, answer queries, and work on these projects simultaneously by ‚Äúmulti-tasking.‚Äù For five minutes I would write a requirement, and then answer an e-mail as it came. I would join a call and continue working on other projects where possible. Multi-tasking in all its glory ‚Äî never losing a second, and always working.At first, I thought I was making progress. Multiple pieces of work were inching forward albeit slowly. Then I realized how many mistakes I was making through confusion, and particularly how long I was spending trying to remember where I left off and what to do next. In other words, I wasted time switching tasks and found myself returning to work that I could have finished in one dedicated session.Scientific studies validate my concerns. Research conducted at Stanford University showed that not only do serial multi-taskers take longer to switch tasks than others, but they also have difficulty in organizing thoughts and filtering out the irrelevant information. Note how their own choice to expose themselves to this stream of content, ironically made the relevance of information more challenging to spot.Dr. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, has also conducted extensive research into the field, concluding that multitasking reduces your efficiency and performance because your brain can only focus on one thing at a time. When you try to do two things at once, you cannot perform both tasks to the best of your ability.The irony of this is that most of us who study productivity instinctively know that multi-tasking isn‚Äôt effective ‚Äî and we still try to do it. The prominent theory why we do this is that our brains have evolved this way. Before modern society, it could have been life-saving to proactively seek out further information such as the sights and of dangerous animals, or similar threats. The sheer volume we are exposed to now has taken this beyond an evolutionary need and thrown us into dangerous territory.Given how technology has increased productivity, many of us want to feel like we are doing as much as possible and leveraging modern-day capabilities. It‚Äôs rewarding to think we can make the most of every moment, consume a wide array of content, and out-work those around us on multiple fronts. Focusing on one thing at a time can seem so simple and as if we aren‚Äôt stretching ourselves appropriately, particularly in the workplace.Working at a bank, I can attest to how technology such as instant messenger, e-mail, video-conferencing, kanban boards, etc. are seen as enhancers of productivity. These features have increased expectations despite a remarkable increase in methods of distraction. We are encouraged to take on many projects simultaneously and continually switch context throughout the day. That could explain why those who deliver the most are consistently the people who focus on less, rather than maintaining a portfolio of grandiose projects with minimal execution.As I write, I begin to wonder ‚Äî how many of us use multi-tasking as an excuse? With some honest self-reflection, I can think of occasions where I have blamed my lack of execution on having too much to do, and not being able to focus on one thing. Amusingly, instead of being called out, my bosses and colleagues have sympathized with me. Perhaps this is symptomatic of our broader inability as a society to be present and accept our limitations cognitively.There is little doubt technology has played a significant role in fostering a multitasking culture. Our attention is always being fought for by a range of devices, each with their own set of addictive, dopamine driving notifications and feeds. I have enough self-awareness to know that my brain floods with pleasurable chemicals when I see message alerts, be it E-Mail, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. Unfortunately, these incessant buzzes encourage us to split our attention and lead us to believe we can do more in the moment.Given we know multi-tasking is not optimal, what can we do instead? As a notoriously talented procrastinator, I have written before about the need to do the work. What I have come to identify is that Productivity is more a state of flow than any particular process. That state is a choice ‚Äî you can choose to have it at any time because it comes from one thing ‚Äî focus.When you choose to become fully absorbed in the task at hand, by removing distractions and committing wholly to that job, you enter that flow state. We‚Äôve all experienced this feeling, where words flow, ideas pour freely, and we lose ourselves in our creativity. Accessing this state invariably leads to our most productive selves, all by having the courage to admit we cannot do everything at once and respecting that truth.If like me you tend to jump around and attempt to complete multiple things at once, acknowledge that science and your results show it‚Äôs not optimal. Once you can accept this, commit this magic formula to memory:Focus ‚Üí Flow ‚Üí ResultsThat means picking a singular item that you are going to work on while removing distractions. You might need to switch your phone to airplane mode, put headphones in, close tabs, shut your e-mail ‚Äî whatever it takes to give you the space you need. The more you allow yourself to become immersed and absorbed in one particular activity, the faster you will enter your unique flow state. That state is your state of productivity, where you will access the creativity, ideas, intelligence, and talent that you have within you, but never allow to emerge due to your struggle to stay committed to one track.Productivity is 100% a choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a mythical creature that comes and goes on its schedule. You are entirely in control, and it‚Äôs as simple as following those steps above.I find the research on multi-tasking liberating. Where once I was heaping pressure on myself to get as much done on as many things, I can now dedicate myself to doing less, better. It‚Äôs not easy to accept ‚Äî sometimes I still think what if I am just multi-tasking poorly, yet the research continues to prove otherwise. Most importantly, I already see rewards both personally and professionally from this mindset switch.My progress has quadrupled since I quit multitasking. Writing one article at a time with total focus has led to curation, my highest earning month, and Top-Writer status on Medium. Check out the difference a month makes below:Before this simple change, I was working on numerous projects. Unfortunately, none of them were going anywhere meaningful ‚Äî even if I was working on all of them. It was difficult to accept that I couldn‚Äôt do everything, but the results from changing my approach have made me a believer. I am happy with the trade-off, however counter-intuitive it seemed.Focus and attention are jealous ‚Äî neither wants to be shared and every time you permit it, you pay. Instead of trying to be a super-hero, embrace your limitations and give yourself a chance to deliver your absolute best. Rather than allowing yourself to be distracted by the bells and whistles of modern society, dare to become fully absorbed in what you are doing and enter your flow state.The interesting question on my mind now is ‚Äî how much is too much? We‚Äôve talked about giving your complete focus to one thing at a time, but what about the number of tasks on our list? I welcome all your thoughts.",17/03/2019,7,0,8,5,1050,471,7,0,0,13,1300
Who lets a frog be a weatherman? (hint: Google) ‚Äî a UX case study,UX Collective,https://uxdesign.cc/who-gives-a-frog-to-be-the-weatherman-hint-google-439318d3c76d,Reut Levi Katzav,12,5,525,"On the app‚Äôs splash screen, you can see the temperature for the given moment alongside a cute illustration of a frog that varies depending on the weather. By scrolling down you can see the weather forecast per hour for the given day, and by scrolling further down you can see more details about the day‚Äôs weather (wind, humidity, etc).I check the weather forecast every day. My children used to come back from school sweating because I thought it would be cold and dressed them in sweaters, or they would return freezing because I didn‚Äôt know it would be cold. So naturally, I was thrilled to realize that Google Weather shows me the temperature variation throughout the entire day, because it allows me to plan the kids‚Äô wardrobe properly and mine according to the hourly forecast.1. The launch screen only shows the weather at the given moment, but if most users want to know what the weather will be throughout the entire day in order to plan themselves, then this is less efficient to them.2. To view the hourly forecast for the day the user has to scroll sideways. Similarly, to switch between the forecast for today, tomorrow, or the next 10 days, the user also has to scroll sideways. Because of this, I sometimes find myself looking at tomorrow‚Äôs forecast instead of checking the temperatures for the rest of the day.3. The additional weather details most probably don‚Äôt interest the average user, and the language feels unnecessarily official (for example: ‚Äú40% chance of precipitation‚Äù can be replaced by ‚Äú40% chance of rain‚Äù).4. If I want to save a favorite location, I‚Äôm prompted by a question that appears at the bottom of the screen and disappears after a few seconds.According to a study conducted in Helsinki in 2014 and a survey of 938 responses, about 4 out of 5 respondents said they check a weather report daily. The average age of people who checked the weather on a daily basis was 18‚Äì29 and 60+. The older respondent was more likely to do so via radio, local TV or newspapers while the 18‚Äì29 year-olds were more likely to get their weather forecast using their phone‚Äôs default weather app.It seems that the more unusual the weather is, the more interesting it is. In addition, ongoing weather affects the plans considered by an individual in their decision-making. This means that during a clear, snowy winter day people are more likely to consider outdoor activities and then go to check if the weather is going to remain as it is.I‚Äôve learned that there is much to improve in the user experience around us. I saw the exercises my fellow-classmates presented in the classroom and I was amazed to realize how many things we lack in the applications we use on a daily basis.I‚Äôd love to develop the idea further and continue to create a more comfortable and pleasant user experience.I‚Äôd be happy to receive any comments regarding my Case Study.Thanks!üìù Read this story later in Journal.üóû Wake up every Sunday morning to the week‚Äôs most noteworthy Tech stories, opinions, and news waiting in your inbox: Get the noteworthy newsletter >",17/03/2019,0,0,21,0,766,563,9,1,0,6,178
Your ‚ÄúData‚Äù Might Be Better Off With Tech Giants,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/your-data-might-be-better-off-with-tech-giants-81ec7362b251,Keren,301,6,1200,"Data is a four letter word with an ocean of meaning. With that, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that ‚Äúdata‚Äù is interpreted differently by different people. To make sure we‚Äôre on the same page , I‚Äôd like to start off by presenting a more ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù definition of this controversial term.According to Cambridge Dictionary, Data is:‚ÄúInformation, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer‚ÄùAs it would seem,‚ÄúData‚Äù is not defined as Jane Doe‚Äôs search history on Google, nor does it have anything to do with John Doe‚Äôs favorite past time. Instead, ‚ÄúData‚Äù is collective, and your distinctive information is virtually useless on its own. For data to mean anything, it must be pooled together, and the more there is of it, the less valuable or beneficial your personal information becomes.So where‚Äôs the problem? Why are we so reluctant to trust multinational tech corporations (MNTCs) with our information?To be honest, I‚Äôm not so sure anymore, and here‚Äôs why:Seems to me we are too immersed in what Ren√© Girard refers to as ‚ÄúMimetic Desire‚Äù. Simply put, ‚ÄúMimetic Desire‚Äù means valuing something just because someone else suddenly values it.It‚Äôs kind of like what you felt when the toys you never played with were given to your cousins when they came to visit. You no longer cared for those toys, but somehow, just seeing other kids enjoying them, made the once worthless pieces of plastic all the more desirable.Which brings me to my next question: Can we honestly say that we cared about our ‚ÄúData‚Äù or what happens to it twenty years ago? Can we honestly say it meant anything to us before multinationals started to earn money from it? Probably not. I understand why it would be bothersome to see someone make a profit from something that is ‚Äúyours‚Äù but I truly believe it wouldn‚Äôt have been considered so valuable in the first place, if not for MNTCs.Just to clarify, I‚Äôm not referring to individual information (social security number for example), but rather details like whether people in a certain age group prefer a certain item over another.Seems to me that we‚Äôve gotten so immersed in the cons, that we often forget about the pros. When companies store our collective data, we also get to enjoy free products. Sure, we need to endure a few ads along the way, but our data, is what allows for targeted ads, relevant specifically to us. If nothing more, our data allows these companies to better understand us, and tailor products that attend to our preferences. Such products are not only material based, but also beneficial to understanding our most fundamental needs, and also, the needs of our planet.Technology, and more specifically our data ,can provide countless solutions to challenges worldwide. Thus, I ask, who‚Äôs better than MNTCs, to do it? Fact of the matter is, these companies opened up new worlds for us. Some of the world‚Äôs most brilliant minds were those who initiated data-related solutions. They know these methods best, and more importantly, how to protect them.Before MNTCs came along, most of our data was found in phone books, miscellaneous service providers and of course, governmental institutions.It‚Äôs not like we had a choice, but quite frankly, the information stored there wasn‚Äôt any ‚Äúsafer‚Äù than it is today. There have always been cases of fraud, identity theft and other criminal activity. Though the risks were there before, those risks hardly received as much attention, probably because we didn‚Äôt think there was much we could do about them.If anything, we put our information in the hands of those that may have been less competent to handle it. As strong as their security skills may have been (or not), I‚Äôm almost certain MNTCs today are, and will continue to be much better at cyber security. Not only because they have the most experience, but also, because they tend to employ some of the world‚Äôs most brilliant minds, and have the best resources to improve and develop their skills and resources moving forward.I don‚Äôt know about you, but personally, I trust Apple and Google with my information, even more than a governmental institution (I explain why in this article).I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúSo what? Why should my data be used in the first place? Why should my information be used by anyone other than me?‚ÄùI see your point but something to consider is that there might be something bigger here. When the information about why we do what we do stays with us as individuals, it will be extremely difficult for future generations to learn from us; what we did right, what we did wrong, and what they need to change to make things better.Thus, I believe that we have a moral obligation to understand ourselves in the best possible manner: societal and cultural processes, and everything else that has a viable impact on our planet, and human existence as a whole. Future generations need to know what we did, so that they can either do the same, or make up for our mistakes.There‚Äôs no denying that the ‚Äúdata‚Äù is yours, and that individualism is still a principle worth preserving. However, in my opinion, your ‚Äúdata‚Äù may be yours, but the ‚Äúcollective data‚Äù should be publicized for the greater good. The collection of our data is not beneficiary solely to MNTCs, but could actually be more beneficial to our existence. The collection of information and understanding of the phenomenas is important to the continuation and prosperity of mankind. I know it sounds extreme, but there is no better way to provide this information without storing data, at least for now.Data may not be a toy, but it isn‚Äôt a precious china set, either.It seems as though the majority of thought leaders within the tech community believe that MNTCs are taking advantage of our information for financial gain. Many claim that they‚Äôve gained too much power and need to be controlled. Some even go as far as saying that they should be terminated.I am by no means saying MNTCs should be allowed to take our data and do whatever they please with it ‚Äî They should definitely be regulated on a consistent basis. However, I do think it is important to include them in the process too.Our data may not be a toy, but it isn‚Äôt a precious china set, either. It has a purpose and a distinct function in today‚Äôs world. Without it, it‚Äôll be extremely difficult to attend to any of the challenges facing us today and in the future. Information and knowledge are nothing short of a treasure trove and unlike the generations before us, we‚Äôve developed the efficient techniques to preserve it.As it stands today, and in my opinion, MNTCs are the most professionally suited establishments to manage our information. Now all there is left to do, is ensure our data/information is not used for malicious purposes, and the best way of doing so is by ‚Äúplaying‚Äù together.After all, when two parties ‚Äúshare‚Äù values, they are much more likely to do what‚Äôs best for them‚Ä¶ You know what they say, sharing is caring.",17/03/2019,3,0,5,14,1050,276,3,0,0,9,321
Under a Brutal Tuscan Sun,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/under-a-brutal-tuscan-sun-4d770c8f9b10,Anthony DeThomas,84,20,5076,"My legs churn the heavy pedals, as the bike surges down an avenue of potholes. Soft green grass unfolds to my left and right, away from the rocky gray pavement. I approach the National Mall ‚Äî Washington D.C.‚Äôs tourist artery. The bike cuts through the warm morning glow at more than twenty miles per hour when a family of four thick, midwestern tourists stumble into the street, entirely unaware that objects smaller than an SUV use the streets here and can move as quickly as my bike races now. To give you a sense of the impending doom, you should know that everything about my bike screams that it was made in the 1970s (like the fading 1976 painted on it and its opposition to the Vietnam War). Between the heavy frame and the ‚Äúsuicide shifters,‚Äù which are in the middle of the handle bars ‚Äî nowhere near the actual handles ‚Äî the bike does everything but stop quickly.My speed shrinks the distance between us, and seconds before crashing into the family, the father, presumably, yelps an easily identifiable midwestern ‚Äúope,‚Äù followed by a rushed ‚Äúsorry!‚Äù Dad pushes the kids farther into the street to encourage me to jerk my bike towards the curb (further building his resume for his ‚Äòfather of the year‚Äô submission). Unable to make a decision that avoids physical pain, I try to hop the curb with my road bike. I confirm the curb‚Äôs immobility, as the stubborn pavement jams my front tire for just a second. I launch sideways off the bike. My right leg skids the rest of me to a stop. The fall rips a naked streak into the knee and hip areas of my jeans and scrapes the skin on my hand and forearm. By the time I come to my feet ‚Äî in surprisingly good shape, all things considered ‚Äî the family plods happily along on the other side of the street, and makes its way, likely, for one of the many air-conditioned museums nearby. As I limped along, still stunned, only one thought bubbled up in my mind.Every year, as spring unfolds in Washington, D.C., the sun hangs in the sky just a bit longer, the grass grows a hair higher, and the urban wildlife makes itself a little more apparent each day. Then, between mid-March and early April, the cherry blossoms erupt, and all hell breaks loose. Tourists flock to D.C. to see (basically) a large pond surrounded by cherry blossom trees, and they take to the rest of the city, too. It‚Äôs inevitable that locals feel their presence.Pushing my bike now, I jammed my hand into my pocket and pulled out my phone.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Italy,‚Äù I said to the voice on the other end.‚ÄúYes!‚Ä¶Wait, why?‚Äù my twin brother, Andrew, agreed.‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôve never been to Europe, we have family in Italy, the food, the history, what else do you need? Plus, a family of asshole tourists almost just killed me‚Ä¶I mean, how hard could it be to go somewhere and not be completely ignorant and so fucking unaware?‚Äù I ranted, hot with anger. Satisfied by my level-headed justification, we ended the call with an agreement to start preparations.After minimal planning, the trip looked promising: we‚Äôd connect with our extended family in Luxembourg before flying to Italy and Spain. Florence, one of Italy‚Äôs cultural capitals, loomed largest in my mind. Assuming all went well, we‚Äôd have at least two-and-a-half amazing days in Florence. With shit-eating grins, we set off to prove how easy this could be. Or so we thought.The train trundled out of Pisa, Italy on the morning of August 3, 2017, destined for Florence. Pisa, with its dusty, brown, and haggard buildings felt more like being around a sketchy cousin who brags about one claim to fame ‚Äî that happened in high school ‚Äî than visiting a cultural high point. The train that helped us escape Pisa looked like any other, with seats too upright to sleep but comfortable enough for a few hours, and an interior that looked new-ish but worn, like a rental car. Regardless, I beamed at our decision to take in the Italian countryside from these average accommodations. It doesn‚Äôt get more ‚Äúlocal‚Äù than taking the train, I thought.The train rocked and glided smoothly, disrupted only by occasional stops, until the train failed to leave one of the stops at its normal cadence. While much of Italy does not accommodate English-only speakers, we did not need to know Italian to understand the commotion and confusion that spread through the cars. The train sat stock still with no explanation, and increasingly agitated riders until an employee emerged into our car and announced in broken English that all passengers had to get off the train. We hauled our luggage off the train, and learned that someone found a man unconscious in one of the train cars. In Italy, apparently, that means everyone gets off of the train and stands in the sun for an hour while another train comes. We squinted up into the mighty blue sky, growing begrudgingly aware that Italian summers feel like the inside of a pottery kiln. As I baked like clay, into a stiffer version of my previous self, I understood why Italians praised the fact that the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini ran the trains on-time.On the topic of fascist dictators, let me say right here that I‚Äôm not a fan. I have to admit, though, I didn‚Äôt know much before my trip about who directed Italian policy (it turns out that a guy named Sergio Mattarella serves as the President of Italy, and has since 2015. While we‚Äôre on the topic, it‚Äôs worth noting that the mafia assassinated President Matterella‚Äôs brother in 1980 ‚Äî more on this momentarily). My ignorance notwithstanding, my mood exuded excitement (and sweat) as I pictured a grand welcoming to my ancestral home (the kind where people kiss you on both of your cheeks and feed you way too much). And what better place to offer that warm welcome than Florence? Guidebooks and websites the world over consider Florence a tourist hub, in addition to serving as the capital of the Tuscany region in Italy. In fact, even the Italian Mafia considers Florence a tourist attraction. Allow me to explain for just a minute.In the early 1980s, a couple Italian judicial officials launched an anti-mafia campaign. The pair and their team gathered enough dirt to build a case against 474 mafiosi. Between 1986 and 1987, the largest anti-mafia trial in history took place in a courthouse built specifically for the occasion (builders fortified the courthouse, and made the structure eat its spinach to stay strong in case of attack). The prosecutors tried and convicted 342 of the 474 mafiosi. Then, as you can imagine, all hell broke loose. After some back and forth violence between the mafia and the government, the mafia stuck it to the feds by strategically terrorizing some of Italy‚Äôs most sacred areas ‚Äî its cultural (i.e. tourist) centers, including Florence [1]. On the morning of May 27, 1993, the mafia detonated a Fiat full of explosives in the Historic Centre of Florence, as it‚Äôs known. The explosion rippled through a number of historic buildings, including the Uffizi Gallery ‚Äî one of Florence‚Äôs main art attractions. More significantly, the blast robbed five people of their lives [2]. Clearly, Florence is an important representative of what Italy offers global travelers.But I had not a damn clue about any of that while sitting on a train platform with the sun threatening to harden my face permanently into a scowl. Right before my grimace cemented, a replacement train chugged up to the platform. Assured that the train had zero unconscious travelers on it, Andrew and I boarded. The train lumbered to its endpoint on the track in Firenze Santa Maria Novella station, making good time. Even though the station borrows its name from the famous 14th century church that sits right across the street from it, we did not expect the station to look like it had not been cleaned since the 14th century.We scurried down the train steps and transformed into hungry observers, fed by the train station‚Äôs foreign environment. Our ignorant eyes found the train station‚Äôs objective dumpiness captivating (to be clear, it was not the funny, humpty kind of dumpiness‚Äîbut the sad, chipped and peeling paint, and errant newspapers blowing like tumble weeds kind). We gawked at every part of the sagging station and its mix of plain and refined commuters. It didn‚Äôt take long to recognize the tourists from the locals. The tourists identified themselves by the perky, pep in their steps‚Äîthese were, after all, people with places to go, enormous portions to eat, streets to litter, and things to ogle. In contrast, the locals distinguished their presence with Industrial Revolution-sized plumes of cigarette smoke, which hung in their faces. It felt every bit of the afternoon in the station, as we pushed through the blanket of heat that smothered the air. We shuffled through the clouds of smoke on our way out of the station and crossed the street to figure out how to get to the vineyard-situated house we‚Äòd call home for a few days. The heavy suitcases rolled and echoed through quiet alleys, past rows of Renaissance buildings accompanied by urban burp smells.Our host‚Äôs detailed directions led eventually to a steep and winding cobblestone ascent. Andrew and I turned and looked at each other, contemplating the full mile we had left. Accepting that we already ruined all of our clothes until their next wash, we lunged up the hill.It felt weird to be both viscerally angry at the intense heat and yet blown away by the sweeping vineyards and ancient, terra-cotta everything that we walked past. The narrow street crawled up a hill lined with charming old houses that could have easily lived in an inviting Pixar scene. The experience brought to mind the part of a WWII movie where the soldiers horse around in the countryside ‚Äî you know, the part where your dad turns and says ‚ÄúLook at that! Yeah, I think I could have gone to war, too,‚Äù before shoving a handful of chips in his mouth.When we reached our destination, the host welcomed us and our throbbing everything in broken English, which made the experience feel all the more authentic. We abandoned the luggage and willed our way back to town for dinner. Our stomachs full on a real spaghetti dinner (the kind where you don‚Äôt dare cut the noodles knowing that would force the chef to cut you), we trudged the couple miles back to where we were staying and turned in for an absolutely dreadful night.Given the minimal preparation I did for our visit to Florence, I had to 1) discover that so few parts of the the city offered air conditioning, and 2) come to terms with the fact that this vineyard retreat lacked anything capable of refreshment (even the chamber of the toaster-sized mini fridge held room-temperature air). If urban hiking in relentless heat seemed maddening, sleeping in a scratchy twin bed while existing in a permanently overheated state drove me a smidgen short of losing my shit. I rolled out of my bed in the middle of the night, covered in my body‚Äôs tears, to crack a window in our tiny room and invite a gale force gust to enter. Unfortunately, a colony (if I had to estimate) of opportunistic mosquitoes entered our room that night instead (the truly amazing part is that, to my knowledge, mosquitoes don‚Äôt even live or travel in colonies but there were so many that it seemed they showed up as one that night). My brother and I woke up, covered with budding red bites and sharing similar commiserations about the insects‚Äô constant buzzing.When the sun crept over the horizon, we both took a turn showering for the third time in 12 hours, as we realized that the shower gave us the only relief from physical and mental saltiness. A bright breakfast spread situated under a shady tree welcomed our chafed spirits. Muffins, pastries, yogurt, jams, juices, and coffee sat waiting to be cut, spooned, stirred, and swallowed. Not long after sitting for breakfast, a fascinating and congenial lesbian couple from South Africa joined us. Hearing their itinerary for the day, though, put us to shame. This trip marked their ‚Äúumpteenth‚Äù time in Florence, and they were anticipating a day of world-renowned museums, open air markets, and frivolous shopping. Not ones to over-plan, my brother and I noted exactly one to-do while in Florence ‚Äî visit the Florence National Central Library.You are, no doubt, wondering how ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù made its way to our itinerary, let alone survived as the only thing we planned when we had just two full days left to consume centuries of some of humanity‚Äôs most celebrated creations. Well, whenever I travel ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs in the States or abroad ‚Äî I always look up a city‚Äôs main library. This even holds for D.C., where I live, and where my favorite site in the entire historic city is the Library of Congress. I love the idea of visiting a city‚Äôs center for knowledge (I do mean that in a douchey way, too but I can‚Äôt help it). There must be an unwritten rule somewhere that says cities have to have at least one library with stunning architecture, remarkable artifacts, and a story, or two. Florence‚Äôs public library, by the way, (you judgmental Jonathan) is the largest in Italy and one of the most important in Europe ‚Äî promising characteristics (and validating evidence for my hypothesis about city library quota, which I call ‚Äúmy library hypothesis‚Äù).After enjoying breakfast‚Äôs various kinds of sugar, albeit in new and exotic flavors like Italian marmalade, Andrew and I slinked to the bus stop to catch a ride into town. The closest experience I‚Äôve had to riding the bus in Florence is riding rollercoasters at Cedar Point (and they said I couldn‚Äôt possibly work Sandusky, Ohio into my essay). The main difference between rollercoasters and the bus rides we white knuckled through is that in Florence the bus travels on disconcertingly narrow and crumbling strips of pavement instead of a steel tracks (the bus also lacked a camera to snap your photo at the scareiest point in the ride so we‚Äôll never know what I looked like rounding that corner). We also seemed to be the only riders who got visibly anxious when the bus driver played his own game of matador, getting as close as possible to bike riders who dared to use main roads.After taking the bus a few times, we figured out that exactly zero Florentines appeared to pay for it. So we stopped paying and did everything we could (short of chain smoking) to blend in when we hopped aboard. For this first ride, though, we went through the awkward motions of pulling out our tickets and getting them stamped while having each clumsy and unfamiliar part of the boarding dance judged by what felt like a cutting gaze from impatient residents. When the bus whipped around a corner and onto a street that runs parallel to the city‚Äôs dividing landmark, the Arno River, we signaled our desire to dismount and join the other tourists baking in the morning heat. Little did we know, the bus ride was to be the least jarring part of our morning.The library remained at the top of my to-visit list but it would have to wait. The idyllic alleyways that funnel towards the city‚Äôs main landmark ‚Äî the Duomo ‚Äî sucked us in immediately. If you want a brief history and flowery prose doting over the marvel of the Duomo, this isn‚Äôt the right place (I‚Äôm just not that guy, and if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, you‚Äôre not that reader). What I will say, though, is that the Duomo is the most iconic view Florence offers, if for no other reason than you can see the dome from everywhere in the city. The Duomo, it turns out, sits atop the Florence Cathedral (which is one of the 71 churches in Florence ‚Äî give or take a few that have been destroyed or ‚Äúdeconsecrated‚Äù [3]). The dome itself looks like a giant Renaissance crown ‚Äî a brick-colored semi-oval that extends towards the sky. True to Italian style, it even has a gaudy gold ball towards the top.The city‚Äôs streets snaked towards the inviting dome. The number of shops grew as we neared the historic district‚Äôs innards. At a certain point, brand name shops hawking purses, shoes, clothes, and jewelry subsumed the neighborhood‚Äôs timeless vibe. Feeling brave with sugar and in no particular rush, we swooped into a shoe store to fulfill our dreams of owning real Italian shoes (that were probably made in China. So I guess our dream was actually just to buy shoes in Italy. Either way, here we were). We perused the cluttered and stuffy shop, side-stepping unwieldy stacks of shoe boxes. The stooped, gray haired and mustachioed shop owner watched us without saying a word. It felt like being in a college psychology experiment, where you know people are watching you and you get why they‚Äôre doing it but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less awkward.Compelled partially out of discomfort and partially out of genuine interest, I reached for a shoe that I thought wouldn‚Äôt be entirely terrible to own and let separate my body from the ground. I held the espresso bean colored shoe, admiring the dead cow skin‚Äôs design. Out of nowhere, the sneakily quick shopkeeper (who likely was then or had previously been employed as a ninja) solicited me for my shoe size. Caught off guard, I panicked and half-yelled, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm just looking,‚Äù without the faintest clue about what I had just triggered.Without missing a beat, the old man lunged towards me, grabbed the shoe (again, with dexterity that, I have to say, was suspiciously similar to a covert agent of feudal Japan), and said, ‚ÄúThen you look, not touch.‚Äù With the shoe in his possession, he slammed it back down on the display and retreated to his lookout post. In a state of partial disbelief that I had been treated with such hostility, and overcome with the awkward silence that hung now in the air, Andrew and I made eye contact and bolted for the door. As we let the door close behind us and looked to step into the street, a caravan of Asian tourists, that could have been mistaken easily for an army regiment given their sheer number, followed a tiny, neon-orange-flag-bearing tour guide towards the Duomo. A handful of the army broke off and filed into the unassuming shoe store, utterly unaware of the danger ahead.In a much less adventurous mood, we shuffled around Florence until dinner became an appropriate consideration. As the sun trickled toward the horizon, we took stock of the paralyzing number of restaurants fighting for stomach real estate. After venturing a compelling distance from the heavily trafficked avenues, we plowed down a sleepy street, as advertised by the chunky, colorful cruiser-style bikes propped against the street‚Äôs walls. A cozy restaurant without any conspicuous American advertising invited our grumbling stomachs in, promising an authentic experience. A series of Italian phrases led us to a tiny table in the middle of the restaurant. Surely a genuine food experience would be impossible to mess up. Surely.The waiter glided over, presenting menus, water, and some kind of bread that we ate too quickly to identify. The day‚Äôs 13 miles of walking showed up to dinner that night. The waiter looped past the table and stopped in his tracks, apparently concerned or intrigued by our savage consumption of everything but the table cloth. He hurried over and offered to take our orders before we polished off the silverware.‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶papardelle,‚Äù I said without even contemplating eye contact (and in perfect English, as usual).‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôll have the tagliatelle‚Ä¶‚Äù my brother said, with just a hint of hesitation, before adding, ‚Äúand the risotto.‚Äù (That‚Äôs two pasta dishes for those of you keeping score at home). Andrew looked up innocently, offering his menu.‚ÄúThe risotto ees-uh also a pasta dish, sir,‚Äù said our observant server.‚ÄúYep, I‚Äôll have that with the tagliatelle. I was going to eat both,‚Äù Andrew attempted to clarify.‚ÄúYou want two pasta entrees?‚Äù the waiter responded, also trying to clarify. ‚ÄúOur guests choose-uh one pasta dish and one meat,‚Äù he suggested.Befuddled by embarrassment, Andrew scanned the menu for the first thing he could identify as a protein and sank his head as he said, ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶chicken piccata‚Äù to the server.We ate in silence and contemplated the rock bottom that was ordering food incorrectly in Italy.I could barely sleep that night, anticipating a library visit the next morning (and because neither the heat nor the mosquitoes had abated). I laid quietly and envisioned the library while the open window breathed hot, mouth air onto me ‚Äî all the more reason to be counting the minutes to sunrise. What a glorious sunrise it would be at the Florence National Central Library ‚Äî even its name exudes a certain criticality in Italian society. Would we discover a best kept secret of Florence? Unlock mysteries of an ancient civilization? I had no doubt. The plan for the next day was to try to be at the library around the time it opened ‚Äî 8:15am. The memories of a lifetime would then be in the hands of the library. If only.The next morning, we enjoyed another continental sugar fix and set off for the library. I hopped on and off the bus like an eight-year-old, and set off down a street along the Arno River, which is known to generally separate the tourist side of town from the locals side. Our house in the hills sat deep on the local side and we found ourselves now back on the tourist side, hunting for the library. We rounded a car and vespa choked corner and there it shined ‚Äî even bigger than it looked in pictures. Built in 1714, the library wears its centuries of exposure on its brown, faded exterior. It also wears a decent amount of bird shit, as I was to learn. The library‚Äôs history is not as colored as some others but it has survived a flood of the adjacent Arno River in 1966, which damaged a third of its collection ‚Äî a collection, by the way, that today includes more than 5.5 million books [4].We floated, practically, up to the center of the library‚Äôs three archways, and stood between the entrance‚Äôs two pillars. We had taken three planes and two trains, walked a half marathon‚Äôs equivalent of steps, suffered an embarrassing berating by a shoe maker, and developed heat rashes all for the experience that followed. This was it.I have shared this sequence of events with many people, and each time, even after two years of reflection and a lot of personal growth, I grow blackout angry. In fact, when I sat down to retell the events for this story, I felt so enraged that I wrote an aggressively negative Google review for the Florence National Central Library instead. So, allow me to share, through my Google review, what ensued at the single, solitary attraction I had been child-playing-with-bubbles-excited to experience. It reads,‚ÄúI showed up at 8:45am, a little after the library‚Äôs scheduled opening time (8:15am), and found that the entrance gate was still locked. After 15 minutes of waiting, there was no sign that the library was opening any time soon. I left and came back 20 minutes later. I was still standing there when a man, who turned out to be the literal gatekeeper, came out of the library to smoke a cigarette on a bench behind the gate, without acknowledging my presence or the library‚Äôs tardiness. He returned inside without a word and I did not see him for another 30 minutes. In the meantime, pigeons had settled into the area above the entrance and began shitting. When the gatekeeper came back out and opened the gate, I was flustered but still excited to enter to library. However, when I tried to enter I was questioned about my purpose at the library. I explained that I was a student who was visiting and came here to read for a few hours (all true, by the way). I could see a flat but immutable joy in his eyes as he told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed in. I asked him why, and when I got his answer (only local students are allowed to use the library), I asked him why again. I continued this approach until he just started repeating, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt come in if you don‚Äôt live here.‚Äù I explained to him that this library was the only thing I had planned to see in Florence (which was also true but from an objective perspective does sound absurd). Still, he refused. I walked away bittered by his xenophobia. That was my experience of Florence, and I think the city and its residents should be embarrassed.‚ÄùNow, had I taken a more enterprising approach to my travel preparations, I would have seen the many other reviews, dating back to at least 2014, that make it clear the library doesn‚Äôt let most tourists to visit. Here‚Äôs a gem from another beleaguered traveler, named Chris, who posted this about the Florence National Central Library in 2018:‚ÄúMe and my friend asked if we could study here, they rejected us for [a] couple interesting reasons:1. The library is currently full. (We went there on Monday morning) 2. You have to live in Florence to get inside. 3. You can not get inside if it is only for once. 4. The library only allows consultations.‚ÄùClearly, they‚Äôre a clever bunch at the Florence National Central Library (at least, in the way that a third grader is clever about arguing that he just said ‚Äúlick my pass,‚Äù instead of what he was accused of saying). I could have owned my fate in Florence with more preparation, and avoided the mutual irritation between the xenophobic administrator and me. Instead, I just showed up and expected the library to accommodate my individual desire, which, I have to admit, is just not realistic. So with my book unread and my blood boiling from Florence‚Äôs heat and inflexible (some might say dictatorial) administrators, I stormed off in no specific direction.We muddled through and salvaged the frustrating day with a visit to some outdoor gardens and a couple restaurants, before heading back to our place for the night. The next morning, under the pre-dawn glow of the Florence street lights, we hiked to the train station to set off for the rest of our trip. We interrupted the city‚Äôs quiet with the rumble of suitcases and my verbal castigation of the heat rash I had developed (that happens when you sweat constantly for two days). Even though I still felt the burn of Florence‚Äôs backhand, I have to say the undisturbed views of the city were spectacular.A few weeks after returning from our trip, I stomped my bike pedals again. This time, I cruised across the city, to Georgetown, to explore some overpriced cupcakes. Along the way, I hit a point in my route that made my stomach drop ‚Äî the National Mall ‚Äî which brought back memories of the crash that had spurred my trip abroad.I pushed through caravans of people wearing matching, brightly colored teeshirts that said things like, ‚ÄúJenkins Family Reunion‚Äù and ‚ÄúWoodlawn Cumberland Presbyterian Church D.C. Trip.‚Äù Each group kicked up dust with their tennis shoes, and emitted smells of sweat mixed with sunscreen. There‚Äôs something about the idea of people disrupting your routines without any awareness and in the sole pursuit of their own, personal pleasure that ruffles my feathers (the bird version of getting pissed off).As I whipped past the Washington Monument, a flurry of selfie sticks, and people who were still using peace signs to pose for pictures, I recalled how badly it felt to be on the receiving end of contempt for tourists. But what I concluded when I sat down to eat a gourmet cupcake that afternoon (with my manly hands and various other masculine traits), is that the cause of the tension between locals and tourists can, in my opinion, be avoided if the tourist adopts an explorer‚Äôs mentality.Someone who identifies as an explorer sets out with the expectation that he‚Äôll be challenged, made uncomfortable, and even suffer, at times. As a result, general burdens are anticipated. Explorers study the places they intend to travel. They learn about history, language, culture, societal norms, risks, and dangers. Then, they learn the best tactics to mitigate the dangers, and invest in the right tools to help them. This is all to say they‚Äôre aware and accountable for how they show up in the world. Whereas an explorer would say it‚Äôs his own job to set himself up for success in a foreign place with knowledge, understanding, and flexibility, a tourist mindset shifts the accountability. A tourist expects that his destination will be welcoming, generous, and accommodating at all times. That presumption and ones like it are what allow people to be so thoughtless when they‚Äôre abroad. It‚Äôs what sows the seeds of painful tourist-local dynamics.I angled the last bite of the cupcake‚Äôs chocolate base and Oreo icing into my mouth, and thought again about how my trip to Florence could be used as a case study on the shadow side of exploring the unknown ‚Äî what happens when you assume constant convenience and pleasure, and fail to prepare for challenges; when you pack all your clothes but forget to bring empathy and an explorer‚Äôs mentality to a modern adventure.I rolled home, powered by cupcake, and decided I needed to tell this story to show how I failed to bring the ‚Äúright stuff‚Äù with me when I visited what I assumed was the ultimate tourist destination, and how that led to one of the most frustrating series of experiences I‚Äôve had. My hope is that we all adopt a little more of an explorer‚Äôs mentality when traveling, so that we can own how we show up, wherever we are in the world.. . .Sources:[1] Dickie, John (2007).

Why Mentoring Someone Can Change Your Life,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/why-mentoring-someone-can-change-your-life-b7793ad046af,Richard Fang,3700,5,1046,"‚ÄòI‚Äôm not experienced enough‚Äô or ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have enough time‚ÄôThese are the common rebuttals I hear when I ask someone why they don‚Äôt consider mentoring someone.I had just finished my graduate program and someone who knew me from university approached me for me to mentor her as she transitioned into work life.I was confused.I was quite fresh out of University and I felt like I wasn‚Äôt ready to mentor someone yet.But she then said, ‚ÄúBut you still went through something I haven‚Äôt yet‚Äù.After that, I realized mentoring doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a CEO with 20 years of experience. If you have something to offer that your mentee doesn‚Äôt have, that‚Äôs all that matters.Many people view mentoring as a process where someone who is older and more experienced teaching someone who is a novice.I have however seen many times where senior members are mentored by the younger generation of today or in my case, I was mentoring someone who was almost the same age as me.These days, mentoring is about open teaching where skills exchanges are common. No longer is it based on age discrimination but rather being able to teach one another new things.This doesn‚Äôt mean though someone who is more experienced is not as needed. This is needed as more youth join the workforce than ever before.There‚Äôs always time in someone‚Äôs calendar. From taking a quick coffee break at work or even breakfast in the morning, there are many ways you can find time to mentor someone.Save the excuses. it‚Äôs not about having time. It‚Äôs about making time. If it matters, you will make time.by AnonymousTime is never an excuse.There are many reasons however that you should consider mentoring someone that goes beyond time and skill.Here are 10 reasons why you should consider mentoring someone!As a people manager or someone who wants to be one in the future, you are effectively developing your own ability to mentor others efficiently within a workplace scenario.The ability to remain objective, plan, strategize and keep your mind open to all ideas are just some of the few qualities needed for a future leader.This is important when coaching and finding potential growth opportunities and learning gaps your mentee might need. Coaching is a skill that must be learned and developed. It does not necessarily come naturally to everyone yet it is a critical component to managing, nurturing and leading others.All this and learning how to move forward without jeopardizing your team‚Äôs outcomes, as well as feelings, is what makes a good leader stand out from the pack.It‚Äôs always important to give back to the community. It‚Äôs not always about your own self learnings but teaching others as well especially youth at risk. This can mean a positive experience for both parties.‚ÄúAt-risk young adults with a mentor are twice as likely to graduate college than those without mentors.‚Äù ‚Äî GivebackA study done by Sun Microsystems studied the career progress of over 1,000 employees. People who had acted as mentors were SIX TIMES more likely to be promoted than those who didn‚Äôt, and 20% more likely to get a raise.Although there isn‚Äôt absolute hard evidence of mentoring being correlated with quick career progression, it‚Äôs safe to assume it gives you skills such as leadership, emotional intelligence and more that are what needed in future leaders.Often enough, mentoring gives you an opportunity to relay your learnings to your mentee through your experiences. This means new ideas and concepts of doing things they might not know before.But this doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a one-way street.Likewise, your mentees can also give a fresh new perspective which could give you fresh new ideas! This could be topics that are more tailored to their generation or something completely different!Similar to Point 4, having a mentee not only allows for you to mentor someone but gives them a chance to show their perspective of a concept.Even if they have a lack of experience doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt show you a new way of thinking on the same concept.Having all potential viewpoints is important and what better way to get one from someone who has a fresh view.Working with your mentee requires you to engage with your emotional radar. This means being able to read on the emotional state of others and respond accordingly.Sometimes it‚Äôs better to be critical whilst other times with empathy.This is honestly an important part that is overlooked. Having a great understanding of emotional intelligence won‚Äôt only help you within your workplace and your career progression but also your personal life as well.Reinforcing your learnings is always important. Once learned, unless we do it regularly, we tend to forget over time the skills originally learned.This is especially the case with leaders who tend to forget about those hard skills that got them to where they are in the first place. What better way to keep those skills than to train someone else up at the same time.Talk about two birds with one stone!Being a mentor to others in your own workplace not only reflects positively around your colleagues but also potentially your wider team members and beyond.All workplaces have some kind of politics and office chatting so wouldn‚Äôt you rather be seen in a positive light rather than a negative one?When you help someone, they will thankful for it.Having a network that supports you what you do is not a short term thing, it‚Äôs a lifetime deal. This investment you make will not only propel you professionally but also personally as a human.A good example of this is Gary Vaynerchuck.Even if you find his commentary a bit over the top, you can‚Äôt deny his good intentions. His Instagram is often a way for him to help mentor others and inspire. It‚Äôs no wonder he has one of the biggest tribes in support of him!I left the most obvious one to last. Mentoring is a great experience for your mentee to learn from someone senior, experienced or just knowledgable in a certain area. But it is also great for you as a person too.As humans, we always incline to help others in need and so why not feel good about it when you do! There‚Äôs nothing more rewarding than knowing you made a difference in someone else‚Äôs life.Happiness is the key to success and longevity!",17/03/2019,1,0,8,0,960,568,1,0,0,2,121

Are You Going After the Right Clients?,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-going-after-the-right-clients-924a539bb4a5,"Jennifer Gregg, PhD",137,5,1023,"When I first started as a freelance medical writer, I said yes to a lot of projects that I shouldn‚Äôt have said yes to.Projects that had really tight deadlines. Projects that didn‚Äôt pay well. Projects that I just didn‚Äôt care about.In the interest of ‚Äúbuilding my business‚Äù I had lost sight of some of the reasons that I wanted to work as a freelancer in the first place.Reasons like a more flexible work schedule, lower stress, and the general ability to call the shots with the work that I wanted ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt want ‚Äî to do.I soon found myself in a precarious position. I was overbooked, overworked, and feeling like I was approaching burnout not that long after I started.I found myself on a treadmill that was hard to get off. This was not exactly what I thought it would feel like to be running a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù business.I felt more like an employee than a business owner. Instead of being my own boss, I had a bunch of different bosses for various projects. I soon realized that I needed to make some changes in the way I managed my business.Whether you realize it or not, when you are a freelancer and business owner, YOU call the shots.Sometimes, once we start working with a client we fall into certain patterns.Maybe we let them slip in an extra round or two of revisions that weren‚Äôt in the original contract. Maybe we turn a blind eye and don‚Äôt charge for the extra calls, emails, and follow-up that pop up along the way. Maybe we know that the pay is a little low, but we keep accepting work from that low-paying client anyways for the sake of comfort from that steady income stream.The assurance of paying work (even if it‚Äôs less than what we want) can make us complicit because searching for new clients and projects that are less stressful/more fulfilling/better paying can be daunting‚Ä¶and uncomfortable.But realize that you can‚Äôt make room for the new and better clients until you drop the not so ideal ones. It‚Äôs that simple. We all can only work so many hours in the day.It‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll have the bandwidth to take on the great clients AND maintain the ones that are a pain in the ass.So ditch what you don‚Äôt want to do anymore. I did.I continue to evaluate my client list on an ongoing basis to make sure that I‚Äôm in alignment with where I want to be, not only financially but also in keeping my stress levels and work-life balance in check.Working within the client‚Äôs budget is sometimes unfortunate, but necessary, part of freelancing. In very (very) rare circumstances does the client leave the budget open-ended. There‚Äôs almost always a cap.However, what you want to watch out for is how the client speaks about the budget. Some immediate red flags should pop up for you if the client (especially if it‚Äôs a new one) immediately asks about your rate or project fee right out of the gate.This is important because generally there are two types of clients: bargain clients and value clients.Bargain clients will prioritize the cost of the project first before anything else, and more than likely they will try to haggle your rate down as much as possible without even giving a second thought to the quality of work that you could produce.On the other hand, value clients generally recognize that quality comes at a price, and most are willing to pay handsomely for high-quality work. Value clients will ask what you can bring to the table first and typically don‚Äôt haggle much on your fee.If you‚Äôre a freelance writer, you want to work with the valuable clients.Take stock of your current client list ‚Äî do you have bargain clients or valuable clients?When thinking about the kind of clients that you want to work with, there are certain factors that are important beyond pay. Things like how easy the client is to work with, whether there are shifting deadlines, and the amount of your support (time) that is required for each project.While all three points are important, the last point can really make or break a project.It seems counterintuitive, but the worst (bargain) clients tend to require the most support. It‚Äôs like the less a client pays, the more they actually expect of you.Bargain clients always want more revisions, more unscheduled phone conversations, and more emails answered right now. The bargain clients almost always end up with the highest demands despite their low budget. They can be a nightmare to deal with.Conversely, the best or ideal (value) clients tend to require the least amount of support. They often know and understand the role of the freelancer and don‚Äôt try to micromanage us when it‚Äôs not needed. They give us the freedom to work autonomously.Most importantly, value clients recognize freelancers as independent business owners. They respect a freelancer‚Äôs time, and they recognize that when they cut into that time it ultimately reduces our hourly rate.The figure below demonstrates this nicely:When you find a client that is in that ‚Äúhigh revenue, low support‚Äù sweet spot, hold on to them like glue. Try and tease out their specific business demographics and do some market research to find other clients just like them. Ask them about their specific pain points, and make sure that you can address those points when reaching out to similar prospects.To make space for all these new ideal clients, give the boot to those other ‚Äúhigh support, low revenue‚Äù clients. They will suck up your time without compensating you for it.And it doesn‚Äôt have to be a confrontational, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never working with you again!‚Äù scenario. Just politely tell them that you‚Äôre not available for any new projects when they reach out. You don‚Äôt owe them an explanation (really, you don‚Äôt). That‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about freelancing ‚Äî you can pick and choose what work to accept.Don‚Äôt feel guilty about dropping clients either. You‚Äôre running a business, after all, so aim high for those lucrative projects and ideal clients. You‚Äôll work less, earn more, and be happier in the process.Originally published at https://www.writeandprosper.com on March 17, 2019.",17/03/2019,0,0,0,12,723,575,2,0,0,4,58
New Software: When and How to Implement into Your Business,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/new-software-when-and-how-to-implement-into-your-business-49e74025e60c,Pamela Ayuso,256,4,752,"As a leader in a small or medium-sized company, you are already working with a set of software solutions that take care of most of the organization‚Äôs transactions, such as sales, purchasing, and accounting. These systems were usually implemented when the company was in its beginning phases. When the company didn‚Äôt have any systems yet, you probably invested in the best software available within your budget and solved as many of the transactions in your company as possible.As is often the case in small to medium-sized companies, budgets are usually constrained, which means that the set of systems you have implemented for the company will not be flawless. You may have already invested in separate software for sales, accounting, project management, and document storage. Alternatively, you may have invested in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, which is a single solution that integrates a variety of areas in your company. No matter what combination you are working with, there will almost always be gaps.Once you have a basic infrastructure that works for your company, investing more money into software won‚Äôt make a difference. In the end, there is no ‚Äúperfect‚Äù combination of systems for your company. A combination of systems that is 100% effective is usually too expensive.Ideally, an overall software solution will be simple and seamless. That is not always possible because the right program may not exist that can solve all the issues that you are seeking to address at the right budget. However, when researching and designing the systems you will use in your company, seek a solution that will take care of most of your transactions. From there, you can add other solutions that will address additional issues. In a perfect world, these solutions would all integrate, but unfortunately, this ideal perfection tends to be expensive. The goal is to build your most flawless combination of software.Once you are done, you will discover necessary improvements that need to be made so that the systems work as well as possible. For example, you can organize the screens you use to input information into the system, so the work flows more intuitively. Or you can design better reports to get the information you need when you need it. You can also make certain fields mandatory to ensure the information you need to register a transaction is always there.There are so many new systems coming out nowadays that we are often tempted to add even more software platforms to the company. However, adding more systems on top of that existing general infrastructure and that are aimed at solving maybe 5% of the general paradigm is not necessarily the answer. You‚Äôll end up with a disorganized amalgamation that is hard to manage. It‚Äôs better to optimize your current solutions; the time and money spent in implementing these additional solutions as well as the training and onboarding process will often not be compensated by the benefit of the solution.Implementing a system takes a significant amount of time and effort. First, you and your team will need to research the best solution. Then, you will need to try demos and free trials to see if the program is the right fit for you and your company. Next, the system has to be designed and implemented in a way that will work for the company, including training and uploading all the necessary data. Finally, the system must then become an integral part of your business operation. It is a significant undertaking, even if the systems may be limited in scope.There may come the point when one of your systems is no longer viable. You will then need to replace one of your software solutions with a different one. If you are replacing a system, you can try to cover more functions in one single solution, such as an ERP, so that you are using fewer systems and solving more of the functions needed in as many areas in your company as possible. It‚Äôs better to integrate as many functions as possible within one platform. With time, you may be able to achieve better functionality, but keep in mind that certain voids in reaching that completely effective solution will probably remain.Try to bridge as many gaps as possible using your current technology. Improvements can always be made on existing software. Patching new software solutions on top of more systems you already own is expensive and time-consuming. Take your time when deciding to add more software platforms because it only works when the benefits outweigh the costs.",17/03/2019,1,0,0,0,1050,465,4,0,0,4,75
The Emotional Revolution,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/the-emotional-revolution-3cae0fca7814,Jonas Altman,3100,6,1051,"‚ÄúWow! Can you imagine the possibilities?‚Äù Frustrated by those who failed to see the logic in his design ‚Äî an unknown, middle-aged inventor placed all his bets on a zany idea. Standing on a wooden platform and suspended high above the crowd, Elisha slashed the rope. The crowd at the 1853 World Fair gasped as he appeared to have plummeted to his death.Elisha had spent the previous two years soliciting prospective buyers for the many uses of his safety lever. One after another, the doors of the New Jersey offices were slammed shut. Folks were dumbfounded by his invention. This time though it was going to be different.Fabricated with a used wagon spring, his lever took hold in the nick of time. The falling platform stopped abruptly. Elisha scanned the scene of his new converts and the soon to be world renown Otis Elevator Company was born.We often struggle to see the true potential of other people‚Äôs ideas. That is until it smacks us upside the head. As irrational beings, logic only goes so far. It makes sense to turn off auto-play on Netflix so we don‚Äôt get roped into yet another episode of our current fix, but we just can‚Äôt be bothered. And what of someone‚Äôs character? Well, we often get that wrong too. Some interns have just as much insight, if not more, than C-Suite suits.Emotion, however, is a whole different bag. If we really want to get to the heart of the matter and make the point ‚Äî there‚Äôs simply no better way than making those around you feel it. And there‚Äôs no better vehicle for engendering feelings today than social media.Instead of connecting the world, Facebook has made us much more dreary, worried, anxious, and avoidant. It‚Äôs one thing to have missed a party, and another to receive multiple reminders the next day that everyone missed your wonderful smile gracing the feed. Or worse yet, you might experience a bad case of early-onset FOMO, already dreading that you‚Äôll be missing out on something even if that something never takes place.Nothing better captures this sentiment than Fyre, the upscale must-be-seen-at festival that didn‚Äôt happen yet ended up the subject of two documentaries. Rationally we know just how silly all the Fyre hoopla is and how our attention could be better turned elsewhere. But it‚Äôs just too hard to resist the allure of an all-star cast of victims and villains as told by shady media manipulators.If you want folks to see the genius of your idea or story, the message might best be laced with triggers to induce emotionally oriented thinking. These triggers might include stories, smells, orange squares, or sounds. What can happen? A festival-goer becomes so concerned they won‚Äôt get a Michelin star supper if they don‚Äôt top up their Fyre bracelet when really they should be worrying if they‚Äôll receive any supper at all.We‚Äôre emotional beings. In some instances, we do well to curb our feelings and in others to embrace them. Instinctively we know what‚Äôs right but the signals we get can often be confusing. Thinking about whether to employ a dose or drizzle strategy can help.If you‚Äôre aiming to move your audience then dose them with emotion. People cannot get excited about an idea if you‚Äôre not. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre seeking to diffuse a situation then try drizzling the emotion. You can always layer on more emotion as you go, but if you blow your lid it‚Äôs harder to crawl back and look composed.Even the Boston Consulting Group has hopped on the emotional bandwagon. They believe a successful business transformation today, ‚ÄúDepends on people who are engaged and motivated to go above and beyond. Organizations can create this condition through a set of heart practices.‚Äù During the past 5 years at Microsoft, this is precisely what CEO Satya Nadella has done ‚Äî injecting some viva! with a compelling vision to ‚Äúempower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more‚Äù. Strategic thinking and agility are important but it‚Äôs heart and soul that goes the distance.What makes sense might not feel sensible. So we weave together stories that comfort us ‚Äî providing a semblance of sanity in a mad world. Our attitudes determine our reality, and believing in something means shifting from what makes sense to what feels right.We tweak and twerk our self-authored stories such that we can make it through another day. We glide into a yoga, CrossFit, Pilates, Zumba (do people still do that?) or some other place reserved for collective sweating to escape our feelings a fleeting moment. The studios are littered with reminders that ‚ÄúYou Are Enough‚Äù just in case we forget to be kind to ourselves.So we buy stuff. Lot‚Äôs of it. We tread in a consumer hamster wheel because the trick to feeling good is to buy more! Yet time and again, the glaze of retail therapy wears off and we are left feeling incomplete.But it‚Äôs busyness at work is perhaps that‚Äôs perhaps the worst offender of how we deflect our emotions. ‚ÄúIn a life where nothing is routine, fear of failure has become a constant existential feeling in the pit of the stomach. And work is the only ritual that one has left to contain that fear,‚Äù writes sociologist Sebastian Pranz.The emotional revolution is a repercussion of centuries of neglecting our innermost thoughts and feelings. Another sip of a latte isn‚Äôt making that churning feeling inside disappear. The collective chant, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all going to be O.K‚Äô is falling on deaf ears.When we moved away from the age of contemplation we became enamoured with the need to act in the world. We abandoned the virtues of being, thinking and feeling in favour of doing. But we might discover a finer balance if we better align our awareness with action.Elisha Otis was not successful because of who he was. He received no accolades for his inventive thinking. And no one was throwing money at him due to the mechanics of his safety lever. He sealed the deal for the elevator with the power of emotion. It‚Äôs that love and feeling which revealed the way up.Jonas Altman writes about work.

‚ÄúGirls Just Don‚Äôt Like Computer Science‚Äù Isn‚Äôt a Good Enough Excuse,The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/girls-just-dont-like-computer-science-isn-t-a-good-enough-excuse-d867d5121a91,Aimee Pearcy,2400,8,1500,"In the UK, just 17% of those working in the tech industry are female.As you might expect, when it comes to the number of girls studying computing in school, the statistics are equally as dismal.Only 20% of students studying computer science GCSE courses are female. For computer science A level courses, this figure drops to a measly 7%.As a result (as reported by the Department of Education), only 0.4% of girls choose to study A level computer science ‚Äî compared to nearly 5% of boys. That means that for every girl in a computing class, there are over 12 boys.And it‚Äôs not getting any better. Despite the rapid expansion of job opportunities over the past thirty years, new research from Accenture and Girls Who Code shows the tech gender gap has actually worsened.One argument I‚Äôve heard often is, ‚Äògirls don‚Äôt want to study computer science‚Äô.My question is, why?Before we try to uncover the root of this problem, we first need to admit that it is a problem.In today‚Äôs world, knowing how to program and building things by yourself gives you a significant advantage.Of course, it‚Äôs possible for someone with absolutely no technical background and zero coding experience to build a successful product ‚Äî but it will be difficult.Sure, you can always hire someone else to do it for you ‚Äî but relying on someone else to build your ideas means you need to have the funding or be willing to give up equity in your company. And if you try to cut corners by hiring low-skilled developers, you could end up wasting a lot of money and ultimately ending up with a terrible product.Knowing how to program and having the confidence to do so is the difference between spending months finding the right technical co-founder for your next project and being able to go home and build your idea tonight.Even if you have no interest, in building your own product, it‚Äôs obvious tech is playing an increasing role in our society.Artificial intelligence is already drastically changing the job market ‚Äî and this is just the start. Who knows how much things will have changed in a few decades from now?If we want to make sure that these changes are positive and improve quality of life for everyone ‚Äî and not just a select group of people ‚Äî we need to make sure the people behind the technology are as diverse as possible.We‚Äôre currently experiencing a skills gap within the tech industry, with thousands of positions going unfilled each year.And the problem is set to get worse.At a time when only 17% of the tech workforce is female, it‚Äôs hardly unreasonable to consider their potential to fill their roles.‚ÄúThe skills shortage is holding back business growth and limiting innovation because we are missing out on the richness of ideas which women could bring to the table,‚Äù said WISE‚Äôs Wollaston. ‚ÄúAnd women are missing out on exciting and well-paid careers.‚Äù‚ÄúGirls just aren‚Äôt into computer science‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good enough argument.It‚Äôs time to admit that there are still some significant barriers preventing girls from studying computing in school, and hence for women from getting involved in the tech industry ‚Äî and ‚Äòjust not liking computers‚Äô isn‚Äôt one of them.In fact, there are a number of likely reasons why women are underrepresented in the tech industry:Many success stories fail to get exposure in the wider industry.Earlier this week, In this article, she mentioned how the women behind the first computer (also known as ENIAC) weren‚Äôt even mentioned at the ENIAC‚Äôs first demonstration in 1946; how Katherine Johnson, the NASA mathematician who calculated the orbital trajectory of the first manned U.S spaceflight was barely mentioned in the coverage of the flight, and, most recently of all, how a news show working on a segment about girls and computer science actually failed to include a single reference to a girl-focused organization.Instead, the network selected a man ‚Äî the CEO of Code.org, a company involved in leading a partnership with the Trump administration) to lead the movement of getting more women into tech.Even when schools do teach computing, the curriculum is boring and uninspiring. There‚Äôs no real insight into how interesting the subject can actually be, and often no incentive to actually apply what you‚Äôve learned.Nobody learns to love computer science by memorizing the bubble sort algorithm or learning definition of the Transmission Control Protocol from a textbook and then regurgitating it in an exam.We should be encouraging children to stretch their imagination, to build things and to solve interesting challenges.Then, and only then, should we even attempt to explain the theory behind it.In addition, the way computer science classes are taught is likely to be unappealing to lots of girls. Numerous studies have shown that women tend to prefer working in groups, while men prefer to work alone. In addition, group work helps to develop social skills and gets students to practice working in a team ‚Äî a vital skill for the workplace.As a result, a transition towards more project-based work that involves working in groups with other classmates is likely to produce a positive outcome for all students.There have been numerous studies as to whether children‚Äôs toys influence their career choices.Girls play with dolls and kitchen sets. Boys play with robots and cars. That‚Äôs just the way it is (‚Ä¶or is it?).As a result, even if everyone starts programming at the same age in school, there is often this pre-ingrained idea that boys have been ‚Äòbuilding things‚Äô and ‚Äòspeaking code‚Äô for much longer than girls. This can give a sense that boys have a head start, and can feel intimidating for girls in computer science classes ‚Äî even if they‚Äôve had prior experience.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a competitive showiness in the classroom that intimidates some women who don‚Äôt have experience,‚Äù says Kathy Cooper, a Master‚Äôs candidate in computer science, during an interview with themuse. ‚ÄúEven in intro classes, the guys seem like they‚Äôve been programming before.‚ÄùAs a result of this perceived head-start, coupled with the stereotype that ‚Äòcomputer science is for boys‚Äô, a lot of high-achieving, very competent women struggle at the beginning and get low marks in their initial exams. Many of them assume they‚Äôre ‚Äòjust not cut out‚Äô for the subject and feel embarrassed with their lack of progress.So, quite understandably, they quit.If we want everyone to have an equal shot at success in this industry, we need to make sure they‚Äôre on equal footing from the get-go.In the UK, 54% of schools do not offer computer science GCSE.On his blog, AVC, Fred Wilson, the Silicon Alley venture capitalist, openly called for more computer science to be taught schools.‚ÄúWe continue to teach our kids French but we don‚Äôt teach them Ruby on Rails. Which do you think will help them more in the coming years?‚ÄùBut we can‚Äôt offer more computer science classes if there aren‚Äôt even enough teachers. England meets only 68% of its recruitment target for entries into computing teacher training courses.Currently, the government allocates just ¬£1.2 million a year to training existing computing teachers.The Royal Society calls for the government to invest ¬£60 million over the next five years with the aim of training 8,000 secondary school computing teachers. This would help put computing education funding on par with physics and maths.However, there is currently a significant shortage of trainees with enough specialist knowledge to teach a technical subject.If we have any hope of inspiring our students to take computer science in school, we need to do everything we can to find good, engaging teachers.Introducing more girls to the subject is a vital starting point, but we need more than that. We need people who actively encourage girls to participate. We need more women to act as role models, to provide inspiration, and to show children how exciting, interesting, and rewarding the field can really be.And, most of all, we people who can inspire confidence in young girls and show them that they are just as confident as their male counterparts.Right now, in the majority of schools, computing isn‚Äôt viewed as a ‚Äòcool‚Äô subject.If we want more people ‚Äî both children and their parents ‚Äî to take an interest, we first need to address many of the cultural and social stereotypes that turn people off the subject.Role models outside of the classroom matter, too. It‚Äôs far easier for a 12 year old girl to relate to Ida Tin, the Danish founder of Clue ‚Äî a period and ovulation tracker ‚Äîthan it is for her to relate to Mark Zuckerberg.If we have any hope of getting more women involved ‚Äî and, more importantly enthusiastic ‚Äî in tech, we need to seriously revamp our current education system.Computer science is already at the forefront of our economy ‚Äî and it will remain there for the foreseeable future.If we want to put our children on equal footing, we need to start preparing now.Want to connect?

Kill the Thought Verbs! Get Readers Involved,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/kill-the-thought-verbs-get-readers-involved-6110ca80241a,ProWritingAid,7100,4,748,"Story is action. Verbs create action. When your characters act, readers turn pages. But, you may slow down your readers when you go inside your character‚Äôs head. Not because you are going inside their head but because you revert to thought verbs.What are thought verbs? They are the verbs you use to tell your reader what your character is thinking. You don‚Äôt want to use them.The major baddies:Each of these verbs, and there are many others, tell the reader rather than showing them.Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk wrote about thought verbs in Lit Reactor. His advice is:‚ÄúThinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking and knowing. And loving and hating.‚ÄùYou‚Äôll make your writing dynamic by changing each instance of using a thought verb ‚Äî know, realize, think, etc. ‚Äî into a descriptive passage where action and sensory detail shine through.Thought verbs often start as the premise sentence to a paragraph. A simple workaround is to remove the first sentence, use the following details, then restate the premise at the end, minus the thought verb. For example:Conrad knew he was trapped. The thick iron door slammed behind him. He heard the lock fall into place. No signal to his mobile in this underground space, so he couldn‚Äôt call for help. Somewhere in this dark, Jack Collins waited for his first stumbling move.The thick iron door slammed behind him. He heard the lock fall into place. No signal to his mobile in this underground space, so he couldn‚Äôt call for help. Somewhere in this dark, Jack Collins waited for his first stumbling move. Conrad was trapped.In a more advanced technique, remove the thought sentence and replace it with sensory action. Show the reader why that ‚Äúthought‚Äù would be in the character‚Äôs mind.Becky knew Emmy should marry Mr. Dobbins, that‚Äôs why she had to show Emmy the letter.Emmy sighed at the memory of George. His goodness lived in her heart all these years. Becky reached in her bag and pulled out her letter from George, the one she had kept all these years. Emmy‚Äôs face lit up when she saw George‚Äôs handwriting. Her trembling fingers reached for the paper. She read the letter.Write detail by detail. Your reader follows each action and will understand what the character knows without needing it stated. Your prose is richer. Your reader gets an emotional ride. They may not understand why they like your story, but they will.Improve your manuscript by searching for thought verbs. Scrutinize each one and rewrite to add action detail. When you replace the thought verbs, your story becomes stronger.Replacing thought verbs will improve your storytelling skills. Go through the manuscript for each of the nine verbs.If you have been short-cutting important story information with thought verbs, you face a bracing revision. Your story will be stronger with action and detail to engage your reader. Instead of telling, you‚Äôll show your readers why your character thinks, realizes, wants, or hates.Mary hated Jim.Jim sat down at the adjacent desk. Mary cringed, waiting for the next humiliating sarcastic statement. He uttered them sotto voce but loud enough for the six other people in the office to hear. Mary heard the snickers. She winced at the sardonic smiles she didn‚Äôt see. Today was her day for revenge.Add details so readers have a sense of place and action. Action verbs create empathy and understanding that no thought verb conveys.One easy way to get your character out of their head is to get them in dialogue with another character.Reactive scenes are an important element in pacing, and great to use after an action-filled scene. Our earlier example with Conrad could be reworked from interior monologue to dialogue. Get him talking with the opponent rather than ruminating on his fate.Once you understand how thought verbs slow down your story, you‚Äôll be eager to add detail and action. Even when writing your first draft, as soon as you use a thought verb, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs time to go deeper into the story.ProWritingAid helps writers strengthen verb usage from hidden verbs to passive verbs with explanations to help you learn as you write. Start using it today.Zara Altair writes traditional mysteries set in ancient Italy under Ostrogoths rule in The Argolicus Mysteries.

Important Truths You Have To Realize If You‚Äôre Serious About Being A Writer,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/important-truths-you-have-to-realize-if-youre-serious-about-being-a-writer-e10dcc267a,Bianca Magbujos,62,9,1975,"Is writing and being able to call yourself a writer something that you wanted to pursue? Do you dream of captivating people with your words and translating abstract ideas into concrete prose conveyed through your own perspective? Maybe you‚Äôre considering to take the leap from making writing a hobby to a profession. Below is a list of important truths that you have to understand if you want to take writing to the next level.Two things in life are meant to be ugly: crocs and first drafts. (Sorry to all the crocs-wearers of the world. I know they‚Äôre comfortable but they just aren‚Äôt meant to leave the house.) One of the most important things you will need to know if you want to produce good writing is learning how to accept initial bad writing. I have failed to write numerous times because I wanted my first draft to be perfect or maybe even to be just good enough. When I allowed myself to write ugly, only then had I achieved progress. My first drafts were so bad that I developed a resting cringe face. Ugh. Sometimes the only way I can start working on a piece is by word vomiting resulting in an incomprehensible set of phrases which either looks like it was written by someone inside a psych ward or a secret code for an evil scheme.Let go of the notion that everything you write has to be golden; quality writing takes time, revisions and a lot of hair-pulling. Trade the need for perfection with the pursuit of creating something that reflects who you are, that way it will be a masterpiece and it will be yours.So go on, allow yourself to write an ugly first draft, even though it may never see the light of day, it‚Äôs a start. After all, first drafts don‚Äôt need to be perfect, they just need to be written.2. You have to stop waiting for permission.All writers are self-proclaimed. I repeat, ALL WRITERS ARE SELF-PROCLAIMED. You simply can‚Äôt wait for someone to give you a go signal, validation or permission to be able to call yourself a writer. In an interview where Jeff Goins, author of Real Artists Don‚Äôt Starve and founder of Tribe Writers, asked Steven Pressfield, who wrote the highly popular The War of Art, ‚ÄúWhen does a writer become a writer?‚Äù he answered, ‚ÄúYou are a writer when you tell yourself you are. No one else‚Äôs opinion matters. Screw them. You are when you say you are.‚Äù This is of course only going to be true once you actually sit down and write something, not just think about writing or talk about writing, or worse, endlessly procrastinate about writing.Once you decide to give your time, effort and dedication towards honing the craft of writing, then you are, my friend, a writer. There are times when imposter syndrome would kick in and I would feel like a fraud thinking that ‚ÄúI am not a real writer.‚Äù During those times, the following words by Shonda Rhimes, author, and creator of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy would always comfort me. In her book Year of Yes, she said, ‚ÄúYou want to be a writer? A writer is someone who writes every day. So write every day.‚Äù3. You will eat rejection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.So you want to be a writer? Brace yourself for the rejections because they will come and hit you, hard. Strangers will appraise, evaluate and pick apart your work. Sometimes they would like it and it would be a wondrous feeling but other times they won‚Äôt. Rejections come in all different kinds of forms ‚Äî some will be coated in kind words, and if you‚Äôre lucky, it may even come with some feedback to help you improve, but some will be downright harsh and brief. Others, however, may not even bother at all.An article I once wrote got rejected minutes after I submitted it to the editor. I admit, it threw my confidence out the window and I pushed that article to my brain‚Äôs recycle bin in an attempt to ‚Äòdelete‚Äô the pain from the rejection. After almost two years, I stumbled upon that piece I wrote and submitted it to a different publication and it got published. Don‚Äôt make my mistake of waiting that long, or trying to get rid of a learning (albeit painful) experience. I know it‚Äôs hard not to make it personal when you get rejected for something that you put a piece of yourself into, but remember that it‚Äôs not. The best way to move forward is to accept that you‚Äôre just not the right match and yell, ‚ÄúOn to the next adventure!‚Äù. Okay, maybe the yelling part isn‚Äôt necessary but it helps.Rejections are inevitable if you want to put yourself out there as a writer and it will suck every single time. The important part is you keep trying. The worst type of rejection will come from yourself when you stopped trying altogether thinking that you‚Äôll never be good enough, and that is when you really start to lose.There‚Äôs really no such thing as a big break ‚Äî just little nudges forward in the endless pursuit of success.4. You‚Äôll be in a constant state of frustration.Writing is hard, and sometimes even thinking about writing is hard. As they say, ‚ÄúMost writers don‚Äôt enjoy writing; they enjoy having written.‚Äù Even though I am very passionate about writing, it can sometimes be grueling. It demands a lot of your time, will-power and there is so much emotion involved. On top of making time out of your busy day to write, you have to rack your brain for ideas, do tons of research, and consider your audience among many other factors. It‚Äôs a tedious process.On good days, I can write 2,500 words only to cut half of it during edits. Writing is an art and a creative outlet but it can also be very frustrating. I sometimes feel that I was going crazy but all writers are in a way crazy after all. The root of all the frustrations with writing comes from self-imposed expectations, being too critical of your work and worrying too much on whether you‚Äôll come up with something worthy of your reader‚Äôs time and attention. All of these sucks out the joy of writing.The feeling of frustration is part of the writing process, you must acknowledge it and do something about it. Turn your abstract ideas into concrete plans and works of art. Use your emotions to create something honest and vulnerable. For a moment, let go of all expectations and do what you do best ‚Äî just write. It‚Äôs a magical feeling when the words are flowing, like being inside your own space-time continuum. One of the most frustrating things for me is trying to finish what I‚Äôm working on with minimum time, but what I‚Äôve learned is to be a great writer you have to be patient with your own creative process.Producing quality pieces are like time-lapse videos, it takes a long time to create but only a few minutes to reveal. The greatest stories sometimes take years to experience and only a couple of paragraphs to express.5. You have to throw talent out of the equation.There is this quote I found somewhere on the internet that reflects my view on the writing process. It said, ‚ÄúWriting is 5% talent and 95% not being distracted.‚Äù It‚Äôs true, you can‚Äôt rely on talent alone, for instance, a large portion of my writing habit relies heavily on caffeine. (No coffee, no creativity.) If you want to distinguish yourself as a writer, you have to do more than just write. You need to develop a vision, the ability to connect with your readers and build the discipline of making writing as a habit, not just merely a hobby. You may be the world‚Äôs most talented wordsmith, but if you only write once in a while, then you‚Äôre just a hobbyist. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. After all, writing is meant to be therapeutic; but this article is for those of you who want to get serious about being a writer.One of the hardest things I had to learn in this pursuit is the practice of writing habitually and consistently ‚Äî to be able to write even when I don‚Äôt feel like writing. Motivation is an elusive thing, and most times you will feel it after doing or creating something, not before. You also need to learn to rely on other people ‚Äî editors, proofreaders, writing coaches, and of course, your target audience. The good thing is, all of the above can be learned over time and with practice. If you really want something to happen and you know the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind it, you will get through all the ‚Äòhows‚Äô.All of the above may seem taxing and requires a lot of work, but along with enduring all the challenges, slowly you develop writing prowess as well.Over time, as you hone your skills, you begin to develop your own voice which is a combination of your perspective, unique experiences and personal character. You express your ideas with your own creativity and originality. You grow your audience along with your personal brand.People don‚Äôt only relate with your writing, they relate with you.2. You develop resilience.The constant rejections and setbacks may be heartbreaking and draining but they also bring out the best in you. Once you get past them and develop systems that work for you, they become badges of honor and gives you an important life skill ‚Äî resilience. You learn to persevere despite the constant disappointments, and that is a strength that will get you far not just in your writing career, but in life.3. You will always be full of ideas.As a writer, you may be in constant frustration, but that also means that your mind is always bursting with ideas. You find inspiration almost everywhere. When I began to look at my bad experiences as an opportunity to be turned into a great story, I started looking at life differently. Too Many Ideas Syndrome or TMIS should not always be a struggle. (Yes, it‚Äôs a thing, look it up.) As a writer, you have the ability to breathe life into these random concepts circling in your head.4. You become courageous.Putting your work out there is no easy feat. Emily Dickinson once said, ‚ÄúHow can you print a piece of your soul?‚Äù Every time you submit your work or hit publish even if it‚Äôs just on your blog with five readers (two of them are your parents), puts you on a state of vulnerability. You lay it out for others to consume, analyze, or even criticize. After sharing my writing on social media sites, my impulse is to shut my phone or laptop and run away. It takes guts to write your truth and reveal it out in the open. So give yourself a pat on the back for being courageous, you little rockstar!5. You find meaning in your work.There‚Äôs nothing like the sense of accomplishment you get whenever you finish the last sentence of your work and it‚Äôs even more fulfilling when you receive feedback from someone who has been touched by your words. It makes all the late nights, hard work, and initial rejections worth it. My driving force is always my audience ‚Äî if I can affect just one person in a positive way, making him/her feel hopeful and less alone, then my work has served its purpose.These are just some of the important truths and factors that come with pursuing the path of being a writer. It is equal parts arduous and glorious. Our stories often have frustration, failure, and desperation; but they are also filled with hope, successes, and beauty. In the end, your love for writing should always outweigh your fears and doubts.",17/03/2019,4,0,12,21,1050,460,2,2,0,4,286
In A Writing Rut? Try These 3 Writing Exercises,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/in-a-writing-rut-try-these-3-writing-exercises-4aff1bc8355c,Cleo Egnal,292,3,583,"Being a writer is difficult. It takes time, energy, and creativity. Unfortunately, those three ingredients aren‚Äôt as easy to come by as sugar, spice, and everything nice. Our time and energy can be consumed by our jobs, our families, our friends‚Ä¶ Really, anything can serve as a distraction from writing if you‚Äôre diligent enough. Need to bang out 500 words? Why don‚Äôt I clean the kitchen first. Time to edit? The dog needs to go on a three hour walk.I get it.Finding the time and energy to sit down and write is one thing, but diving into your creativity can sometimes feel impossible. I‚Äôve been there, staring at a blank word document for hours, wondering how in the world I‚Äôm supposed to make magic with words when I can‚Äôt even think of a few sentences to write. I think we‚Äôve probably all been there at some point.Luckily, I‚Äôve found a secret weapon‚Ä¶ Writing exercises.Doing a writing exercise might sound daunting, or at the very least tedious. Another way to procrastinate the project you need to get done. How does following a prompt about shoelaces help me finish my novel?The thing about being a writer is that we sometimes get stuck. Writer‚Äôs block is real, and it‚Äôs a terribly annoying experience. When I get stuck, really stuck, I‚Äôve found writing exercises to be the very thing to snap me out of my rut, or at least help jumpstart my creativity. Even if you don‚Äôt get any useable material out of these exercises, being able to say you got your writing mind working again is just the step you need toward breaking out of your creative block.Here are my three favorite writing exercises to spark your creativity during a rut.Go grab a book off your shelf. Any book will do. In fact, probably better if it‚Äôs a book you haven‚Äôt touched in a while ‚Äî We all need that extra motivation to dust our bookshelves, don‚Äôt we?Flip the book open to a random page, and pick a random sentence. Try to pick your sentence without even looking. Just let your finger land somewhere on the page.Do you have it? Good. That‚Äôs the first sentence you have to work with. Now write from it. You can keep the author‚Äôs voice, or incorporate your own, depending on how challenging you want the exercise to be. You can write for as long as you want. Maybe today you only do an extra sentence or two. Maybe tomorrow, a few paragraphs. The world is at your fingertips ‚Äî Literally!Chose an object. Describe it, in as much or as little detail as you like. Done.This one is great if you‚Äôre struggling with dialogue, or getting in your character‚Äôs head. Chose a character from any book, movie, TV show, graphic novel, whatever floats your boat. Just don‚Äôt let it be a character you created.Now, write a monologue in their voice. Maybe they‚Äôre ranting about the terrible day they had, or gushing about a new love interest. Maybe they just spurt out a few sentences on what they had for breakfast. Whatever you decide, make sure you stick to the character‚Äôs voice.Being a writer isn‚Äôt all rainbows and sunshine, and anyone who tells you otherwise is selling you something (probably a new notebook‚Ä¶ Writers are suckers for new notebooks). But there are ways to break out of writer‚Äôs block, as daunting as it may seem. I hope these writing exercises prove helpful, and you find a way to spark your creativity again.",17/03/2019,2,0,1,3,1050,416,2,0,0,4,217
Letter to Natalie Goldberg,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/letter-to-natalie-goldberg-45231f1bf639,Jk Mansi,1100,2,260,"Santa Fe, NM April 24, 2008Dear Natalie Goldberg,I love how you teach me to write. I love it so much that I hate you.I hate you for the power you see in me, that I feel within myself, caged and panting and pacing. A power I am not unleashing, that I am keeping tethered, writing in long sentences and short measures. Something that you saw in me at the workshop at the Santa Fe Zen Center, cracking it open like a walnut. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just touch the surface‚Äù you said to the group. ‚ÄúReach underneath and feel the belly, then slit it open and let the guts spill out, like Juhi‚Äù. Did you say this, or did I imagine it? You smiled at me.I touch on the the truth momentarily, like putting a dirty tentative finger into the pus of an open wound. Instead of reaching into the gaping hole and feeling the pain, I withdraw too quickly, an inverse premature ejaculation.I look around self consciously waiting for applause and admiring glances, then put a piece of clean gauze and a band-aid on the spilling words as though that will stop the hemorrhage from the star shaped Phillips head screwdriver wound deep deep in my heart.Sometimes the band-aid is cheerfully hot pink and lime green, with Sesame Street characters on it, but mostly liquid crimson stains the edges when I pull it off. I am learning to sit in the pain, then letting it go, and be still through the bleeding.Thank you for teaching me this. JkM¬©JkMansi 2019.

The Best Writers Do Their Homework,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/the-best-writers-do-their-homework-648a0f98a688,Michaias Grigori,129,6,1316,"You start out with the best of intentions. You‚Äôve got this crazy idea for a story bouncing around in your skull, and you want to set it free. But first, you know you‚Äôll need a game plan.Stories might pop into your head from seemingly out of nowhere, but you can‚Äôt transmit those disjointed images to your readers without doing a little homework first.Here‚Äôs where I start:Determining the genre of a new story idea is step one.This sets the stage for everything else. It provides a structure, some models to work with, common tropes to use or subvert, and even some basic plot options. (Let‚Äôs face it: none of us are inventing new plots at this stage in human storytelling. All we have left is our voice and our perspective. Make the most of them.)Sometimes genre is obvious right from the start. For me, it‚Äôs mostly a mood or tone sort of affair. If I keep visualizing a character in Max Mad-esque garb, I know I‚Äôm writing a sci-fi dystopia. If I picture a bunch of people yelling at one another in someone‚Äôs backyard, maybe we‚Äôre in general fiction drama.If you‚Äôve been writing for a while, you probably have a sense of the types of genres you like to dabble in. You should absolutely keep dabbling, but my advice is to lean harder into one or two of them to really hone your skills in those genres. Plus, you can always incorporate elements of subgenres, in case you really need to work some horror into your sci-fi dystopia.Some writers don‚Äôt know what genre they‚Äôre heading toward right off the bat. That‚Äôs fine, but you need to figure it out early. If you have an image or a character in your head but don‚Äôt know where to go with the story yet, try freewriting. I‚Äôve done that with ideas that started as experimental writing prompts. Now, apparently, I‚Äôm in the thick of writing that horror/sci-fi dystopia (okay, so the example was from my life; I‚Äôm kind of eyeballs deep in this story right now).The point is that freewriting is always worth it.Maybe you don‚Äôt want readers. Maybe you just write for yourself. That‚Äôs fine, but then this article was never intended for those writers, anyway. (If you‚Äôre in that camp, you‚Äôre more than welcome to stay here, of course.)For those of us who work at building an audience, we have to consider readers; otherwise, your writing is going nowhere.Again, knowing the genre helps. Imagine the books you like to read. Maybe it‚Äôs all over the place, but I‚Äôm betting there are some trends to what you like. Maybe you like mystery, thriller, psychological thrillers, and memoirs on cooking (there‚Äôs usually one oddball genre that stands out, right?).The trick here is to think about not just your genre, but also adjacent genres. If you need help with this, Google is your friend. (Just kidding. Google is hateful; use DuckDuckGo.)Just start by searching something as simple as ‚Äúwhat genres are similar to mystery‚Äù. You‚Äôll be down the rabbit hole in no time.Forums can also help. If your favorite author in your genre has a fan website, check those out. See what readers are saying. Pay close attention to the parts of the original work that fans praise and the things they criticize. All of it can be useful.Oh, there‚Äôs also Reddit. There‚Äôs a subreddit for everything. Trawl through that for a while, and you‚Äôll get a sense of what readers want. Take notes.Yes, that‚Äôs a lengthy subheading, but it‚Äôs intentional. There are things you know you don‚Äôt know, and then there are things you don‚Äôt know you don‚Äôt know. We can forget about the latter for a second, although it will become vitally important.First off, what do you not know? Is it how to structure a story? There are a lot of good models. Recently, N. A. Turner published a great article on how to structure a short story. Give it a read; there‚Äôs some great advice in there.Maybe you know all the major events in your story and even the best techniques to convey each part of that story. Great! What about specific plot points, though? Is there some weird technology you need to wrap your head around so you don‚Äôt resort to a MacGuffin? Trends in fashion to make your character‚Äôs style pop? Botany knowledge that‚Äôll convince readers your character does know how to concoct deadly poisons? Maybe your character is a skilled martial artist, but you‚Äôve never kicked anything more agile than a stubborn vending machine.So how are you going to learn all these things? Research! Research builds believable stories.Maybe you can‚Äôt afford to go on experiential learning adventures to figure out firsthand how the pros do things, but again, the Internet is your friend.Besides search engines and Reddit, maybe you should try Quora. I started an account recently and have been peppering the place with all sorts of questions. For example, the story I‚Äôm currently writing involves a character in a man vs. nature fight against a massive wild boar. I‚Äôve never hunted wild boar before, so my knowledge was next to nil. (I did hunt deer once as a kid, but all I remember was being really bored as I sat in a tree stand for eight hours and devoured boiled eggs my dad brought along.)So to fill in my knowledge gaps, I asked Quora, and did the readers ever deliver! The wisdom of the crowd is remarkable. Now, armed with knowledge of spears, clever stratagems, best hunting environments, best time of day to hunt, and even the gargantuan size boars can grow to, my protagonist can go forth and (maybe) conquer!Also, by shopping the wisdom of the crowd, I did better than I ever could on my own. I definitely learned what I knew I didn‚Äôt know, but users pointed me to even better knowledge: that which I didn‚Äôt yet know I didn‚Äôt know.Now, I couldn‚Äôt possibly imagine sending my poor protagonist out into the wilds with nothing but a knife. Victory wouldn‚Äôt come across as bad ass. It would come across as ridiculous. Thank you, readers (and research!) for saving my bacon!This is the hard part. At some point, you have to take all that wonderful research you‚Äôve gathered and transform it into a beautiful story.I often struggle with this step. I‚Äôm an academic at heart, so I love my research. But to collect all that knowledge and not share it with the world is just selfish. Think of all the hours of joy you‚Äôve experienced in piecing together the complex parts of this story you‚Äôve been crafting. You can share that joy with others by sending your story out into the world.Sometimes, I don‚Äôt start writing because I find the story intimidating. After all, I put a lot of research into getting each detail right. What if they‚Äôre still not right? Is my story ruined?Maybe. But I‚Äôll never know until I put it out there. I encourage you to do the same.I‚Äôll end with this great anecdote a Quora user named Brian Olsovsky shared about hunting wild boar:Wild pigs are loud and noisy when they travel so you will have time to prepare. Beware, these pigs are very dangerous and if they are moving they move very quickly and follow one another. I was once literally trampled over by a sounder of hogs while laying on my belly in a muddy swamp trail because they all followed the lead pig when he came running towards me.I think of the wild pigs in this snippet as story ideas and the research that goes into them. Sometimes, those ideas move fast, and I feel trampled by them. I feel buried under all that research. But even getting trampled by a sounder of wild pigs hasn‚Äôt stopped Brian. He‚Äôs still a hunter.As for you, well, you‚Äôre still a writer. Arm yourself with knowledge. Then execute.",17/03/2019,2,0,6,2,1050,416,2,1,0,7,66
Writing and Ramen,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/writing-and-ramen-82e6c8da8563,Polly Campbell,257,4,843,"Somedays, instead, when I‚Äôm not making ramen, I sweep the floor or take a shower, or fold the clothes ‚Äî but it‚Äôs all really the same thing because, during all these repetitive tasks, I‚Äôm pulling ideas from the ether too. Creating happens in the now whether you are writing it down or not.At some point though ‚Äî and I really do write every day ‚Äî I go into my desk, in the office, and I begin arranging those ideas onto the page. And it always feels hard. And consuming. And terrible and exhilarating. I write the way an orange makes juice. When you squeeze an orange, juice comes out, because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside. Under pressure, words come out. There is always a certain amount of pressure I feel to write. I feel more pressure when I don‚Äôt.I write to translate big ideas into something I can understand better. This is sometimes why it feels so hard and takes so long because I haven‚Äôt found the knowing yet. Writing is how I learn and remember. The way I connect with others. The way I make money to buy spinach and red wine and my husband‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day present.I write to figure stuff out. And maybe my writing will help you figure out your stuff too. Because my experience is yours. Yours is mine. We both know what it is like to fail and hurt and be bored and enthusiastic. To not get picked.Even so, your experience is unique. Only yours. Mine can only be told by me. I try to show you something in my stories. To entertain or inspire. To validate so that maybe you can know yourself better too. My words might say ‚Äúthis happened to me and can you believe it and it was so hard and I‚Äôm OK. I am still OK. And, I promise you, you will be OK too. And I know this sucks and it is so hard, but you, you got this.‚ÄùAnd when the ramen is made and the dog is walked and I sit down and I drop these thoughts on the page, they are never ever never all that good. They never have the clarity or emotional resonance that they do in my head. Or, in my heart. They are distilled too much by the filter of my imagination and my desire to get them just right. Polished into a vague smoothness by my inner critic. Still, I try. I sit there at the desk and I type, and tweak, and delete. And write again. I move paragraphs around. Read them aloud. Listen for the pacing and the rhythm. Release the clutter. Tighten the focus.After awhile, sometimes hours, sometimes days, I print it out and grab a pencil and I go through each word, every line. It all looked so much better yesterday. Now there are pencil scribbled notes alongside, crossed out words and lines, more cutting and culling.And I‚Äôm tired. Sometimes I‚Äôm feeling low because I‚Äôve put so much into this and it‚Äôs still not saying what I want it to say. It‚Äôs not there yet. I sit over it a bit longer. Pulling and pushing and thesaurussing words into place and maybe I‚Äôll get a sense of the next step and I‚Äôll make a note of it right there in all caps in the copy so when I sit down again tomorrow after the ramen and the dog walking, I‚Äôll know just where to start.And, when I get to that place, I‚Äôm done. Sometimes I get up from the desk right then, when I have figured out the focus sentence or structure. When I know the tone or see one sentence or one idea that might just work to pull all the others together.Sometimes, I just close out the file and move into email, follow up with an editor, research another story idea, read a study I found about women and swearing or one on self-compassion.Somedays there is no getting up until I fill in the editor‚Äôs address and hit ‚Äúsend.‚Äù I‚Äôm frantic, by this time, on deadline and I can‚Äôt get it just right and the source I need for fact-checking isn‚Äôt getting back to me and I‚Äôve got 20 minutes and the daughter‚Äôs about to barrel in dropping her backpack in a thump on the wooden floor and the dog needs to pee again and there has been no breakfast and no ramen and I hate this job. And. I am so lucky that I get to do it.I‚Äôve been through this article 60 times. It‚Äôs almost there.And then it is. For now. I‚Äôm out of time. Must let it loose. I save the file and attach to the email and then I just want to check one last thing, that was there flickering in the back of my mind while stirring ramen. And, oh, yeah, that section could be better. It just doesn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt work, yet.And the door opens, and the daughter is in and just give me one more minute, girl, I‚Äôm just going to finish this up.",17/03/2019,2,0,1,0,1050,486,2,0,0,4,87
My 10 Writing Rules For Finding Success As A Writer,The Writing Cooperative,https://writingcooperative.com/my-10-writing-rules-for-finding-success-as-a-writer-e49d0b3f2faa,Brian Kurian,4400,12,2323,"Every writer out there seems to have different rules that they follow. We‚Äôre all different and different methods work for different folks. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to do it.But maybe some of the below things will help you find the type of success you‚Äôre looking for.I have to admit that I‚Äôm not the type of person that sits on their computer for hours researching SEO topics to write about. I doubt you‚Äôll find stories about my family that I enjoy writing as some of the most popular stories out there on the Internet.Yet, I‚Äôve seen online that one popular topic people seem to enjoy learning about is Startup culture. My last job was at a local Startup here in my community and I enjoy sharing my experiences of working with them so naturally, it was a good fit. I was able to get accepted as a Writer for The Startup and I enjoy sharing my personal insight with their readers.I also write for 11 other Medium publications. Again, I search for publications that align with topics I actually enjoy writing about. I researched the publications to make sure that it‚Äôs a good mutual fit before I applied to be a Writer for them.One by one, I was able to gain access to the type of audience that would enjoy my work and at the same time be the type of people that I would enjoy producing content for.This is what I mean when I say I try to find a common ground between topics I‚Äôm knowledgeable about and topics that are popular online.No matter what you end up writing about or discussing, there will always be someone that disagrees with you.There‚Äôs always going to be at least one person out there that tries to belittle the quality of your work and degrade the value of the content you‚Äôre putting out into the world.‚ÄúOne negative voice aimed at me has the incredible power to drown out a thousand positive ones. One of the greatest things I can achieve is to never let it.‚Äù  ‚Äî Dan PearceUsually, these types of people are the same ones that don‚Äôt have the guts to create anything or share their own experiences because they‚Äôre afraid of being rejected. It‚Äôs easier to criticize someone else than it is to be criticized by others for your own work that you‚Äôre producing.I often like to use the analogy that it‚Äôs easier to be a random fan sitting in the crowd than it is to be one of the players in the actual game itself.Don‚Äôt let the random online chatter of some basement dweller deter you from doing what you love. Keep learning, writing, and evolving. You‚Äôll get better over time if you keep working to hone your craft.I‚Äôm living proof of that.I always try to make sure that my writing offers some sort of value to anyone that happens to read it. Of course, I write about things I‚Äôm excited to write about but I don‚Äôt want to just discuss nonsense.I aim to inspire, to teach, and to create a better world around me through my written words. I want to deliver high-value messages every time I crank out a piece of content and I do my best to keep the potential reader in mind.Writing is a beautiful art form. As a Writer in today‚Äôs day and age, you have the ability to impact countless people‚Äôs lives. We writers have the ability to harness the power of the Internet and social media in order to reach more people than ever before with our messages.So while you‚Äôre writing, working, and reaching, be sure that your messages offer some sort of value to the people that read them.‚ÄúNo legacy is so rich as honesty.‚Äù  ‚Äî William ShakespeareI don‚Äôt like dealing with fake people. I tend to write with the same personality I carry in my everyday life. I‚Äôm a very open and honest person. I try to always be genuine and unapologetically myself.Regardless of how some people might view me or my opinions, I still speak my mind. That‚Äôs why I write about the things I choose to write about and have the style of writing that I have.My writing isn‚Äôt perfect and neither am I. There will always be people that will disagree with my opinions but that‚Äôs exactly what they are. Opinions. Everyone is entitled to have their own and there‚Äôs no reason why we can‚Äôt still show each other respect while we disagree with each other.I‚Äôll talk about my personal experiences, my family, relationships, business, Startups, Sales, and a whole plethora of other things that have happened to me or are currently happening to me.One thing‚Äôs for sure, you‚Äôll always get 100% honesty from me. I enjoy being honest in my writing because too often, we as a society are exposed to dishonesty and deceit. I don‚Äôt know about you but I for one am sick of being lied to.Therefore, you can rest assured knowing that I won‚Äôt ever lie to you about anything in my writing. You can read my work trusting in the things you‚Äôre reading.Knowledge is power. Whether I am writing a piece about Startup culture or about the educational system in America, I always want to make sure I absorb as much information as I can about the subject.Yes, more often than not, I‚Äôm sharing my personal experiences with you but we also have this thing called the Internet and she‚Äôs absolutely delightful.I enjoy researching and digging up information online.I‚Äôm also an avid reader. I‚Äôll recall different pieces of information I remember reading about and I like sharing that information in relevant articles I write as well.I‚Äôm a big fan of Youtube too because I‚Äôm a visual learner. I love watching videos on things I want to learn more about. Oftentimes, hearing and seeing the message helps me absorb the information much better than if I were to just read about it in a book.Podcasts are one of my favorite platforms to utilize in order to gain new knowledge as well on subjects that interest me.We have a wide array of platforms we can utilize to make ourselves more educated if we so choose to use them. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to learn new things. Do whatever works best for you.Those seem to be the ways that I increase my knowledge base so that I can share the valuable information with you in return. Again, I‚Äôm focused on making the world a better place through my writing. The best way I can achieve that goal is to absorb as much useful information as I can and then share that information with others.No matter where I happen to be at or what I happen to be doing, if an idea pops into my head that excites me, I jot it down in my Evernote app or my Medium app.Currently, I have 60+ drafts in my Medium folder. The majority of them simply list a title and sub-title of what I‚Äôd like to write about.By jotting down quick title ideas and notes in this way for new stories as they come, I can prevent the possibility of me forgetting about them. I live a pretty hectic life which I‚Äôm sure many of you do as well.How many times did a great idea for a story pop into your head when you were at your day job or while you were grocery shopping but you forgot all about it 20 minutes later because you forget to jot it down somewhere?Yup, me too. But thanks, to the Evernote and the Medium app, all my awesome ideas for stories and Blog posts get jotted down and stored for later.Every Writer at one point or another suffers from Writer‚Äôs Block. They‚Äôll feel like they have no clue what to write about next or feel like they are completely out of fresh ideas. I‚Äôve been there before, trust me I get it.There are some things you can do to push through Writer‚Äôs Block though. One of those things is to write through it.What I mean by writing through writer‚Äôs block is to write even when you don't feel like it. Pull up one of your rough drafts and start typing or writing anything that comes to your mind. Let the ideas flow instead of simply sitting there waiting for ideas and words to pop into your head.I‚Äôve found that the simple act of writing usually pushes my mind to get into a creative flow state. This flow state is a beautiful phenomenon that happens where I feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù and all of a sudden the words are coming more easily and my piece starts coming alive.Rarely will great ideas come to you when you are just sitting on your butt and staring at your computer screen. At least, that‚Äôs been my experience.The writing industry is an extremely tough and competitive one. It‚Äôs hard to earn a full-time living as a writer but it‚Äôs completely possible if you put the time and energy into achieving this goal.It won‚Äôt happen overnight but from my own personal experience, there is great potential to earn a decent income from something such as a Blog on Medium.Those are some of my earnings from the Medium Partner Program for the past few months. The few hundred dollars I‚Äôm earning has helped my wife and I pay extra bills and pay down some of the debt we have.It‚Äôs not a million dollars or anything but it‚Äôs helped us tremendously and I‚Äôm confident my writing will continue to earn more money over time as I continue to publish high-quality stories for you.Again, this didn‚Äôt happen overnight. I joined the Medium Partner Program in April 2018, so I‚Äôve been blogging seriously for almost a year and had to work extremely hard to build my following and develop my writing voice. I dedicate around 10‚Äì12 hours each week to writing and growing my blog. It hasn‚Äôt been easy but it‚Äôs been completely worth it.When I first started blogging, I never had any previous experience with writing or developing any sort of following online. Everything was extremely new to me, and I‚Äôm still learning new things every single day.But if I can do it then so can you. You just have to develop some goals for yourself, work hard to hone your craft, and be patient as well as persistent. I‚Äôll be here to support you any way I can.Stay focused on the silver lining. Appreciate every single new follower you earn and every penny you earn from your writing. All of it matters, your hard work is being recognized. Before you know it, people will be telling you how much of an impact your stories are making on them and on their day.Writing is unbelievably fulfilling, to the person that is doing the writing as well as to the person that is doing the reading.Look for the good while you‚Äôre on your writing journey because it‚Äôs easy to get frustrated and depressed when things aren‚Äôt going your way (which they won‚Äôt sometimes).When I first started Blogging, I would obsess over the stats of each one of my published stories. I would check the stats on my stories numerous times a day and drive myself insane.Why did this particular story do so well with reader engagement but this other story that I spent twice as much time writing completely flop?What kinds of articles are performing the best?Are there certain topics I‚Äôm writing about that are performing better than other topics?These are the types of questions I would constantly ask myself and it literally drove me insane.It was ridiculous and I started to forget why I started writing in the first place. I jumped into Blogging because I had several things I wanted to share. I had messages I wanted to get out into the public.Blogging was a fantastic platform for me to express my creativity. I didn‚Äôt jump into blogging because I wanted to check some damn performance statistics for stories all day long.And so now, I only check the stats on my stories maybe once every day or two. That‚Äôs it. I focus on the quality of my writing because that‚Äôs what writing should be all about. Not the statistics.I strongly encourage you to do the same.Stop obsessing over stats and focus on the quality of your writing.Trust me, your mental health will thank you for it.Simply put, you‚Äôll never be able to sharpen your skills as a Writer and find any sort of success in this industry if you don‚Äôt devote enough time to your craft.We all live busy and hectic lives but don‚Äôt use that as an excuse to put your writing on the back burner day after day.Life happens to all of us but it‚Äôs how we adapt and pivot that truly matters. I make a conscious effort to devote at least an hour or two to writing something every day. Sometimes, I try to finish up a rough draft I have sitting in my Medium folder or I‚Äôll write up an article from scratch that popped into my head.Other times, I have an article that needs some more tweaks made to it before I feel confident with publishing it so I focus on that during this time period. Regardless of what sort of writing I‚Äôm doing during this hour or two, the key is that I‚Äôm writing SOMETHING.I‚Äôm actively working to evolve as a writer and writing is always at the forefront of my mind. The best way to improve your writing skills is to practice intelligently and deliberately.Set aside time for writing if you are serious about becoming a better Writer and making some sort of career out of it.These are my 10 writing rules that I‚Äôve been following in order to find success in this crazy writing industry.What are some of the rules you tend to follow with regards to writing?",17/03/2019,5,0,10,5,1001,635,12,1,0,19,461
Blockchain Technology: Understanding Made Easy For You,DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/blockchain-technology-understanding-made-easy-for-you-98da926492ac,Simi Joseph,39,6,1126,"Since 2008 there have been talks about blockchain technology and its decentralized, distributed public ledger transaction technique. But this concept skyrocketed only after the implementation of the same in cryptocurrency. Although the idea of cryptocurrency is now being challenged, the uses and implementation of blockchain have since then only increased.Blockchain have been actively worked upon and researched. We have found many ways to have blockchain implemented to increase security and efficiency in many sectors. But what exactly do we know about blockchain?www.datadriveninvestor.comWell, you must have seen many old school movies when an exchange of money or otherwise between two parties were recorded in a big fat book. This big fat book who is called a ledger.The transaction between two parties recorded in a very systematic manner. This is to ensure if there was any claim of discrepancy all you had to do was to check the ledger and you would know the complete sequence of the transactions.Say, a piece of land, Plot 92 was owned by Bob Prichet which was then inherited by his son, Sam. But Sam, in order to get a hold on hard cash, he sells the land to Ryan. Ryan is just an investor who then sells the land to Jack. Now the entire transaction between all the parties involved is mentioned in the ledger as follows -December 1882 ‚Äî Sam Prichet Inherits the plot 92 from father Bob PrichetJanuary 1891 ‚Äî Sam Prichet sells plot 92 to Ryan Crasta ‚Äî $400April 1891 ‚Äî Ryan Crasta sells plot 92 to Jack Shepherd ‚Äî $800Sam realizes he made a mistake and conspires to get his sold land back. He goes to the land office. He informs the custodian that the land is owned by him and not Jack Shepherd who claim to be the owner. The custodian in order to verify this claim checks the ledger which holds the transaction for plot 92. The ledger informs him little lamb was sold by Sam to Ryan on January 1891 which was then sold to Jack Shepherd on April 1891 thus disregarding Sam‚Äôs claim to the land.Blockchain also works with the same technique but with the security and efficiency of the digital world. But Blockchain technology provides you with a lot more advantages than an ordinary ledger.Blockchain was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto. But the technique was not implemented right away. Soon after this technology was implemented in cryptocurrency.A blockchain consists of a sequential connection of blocks which contains data, hash Function, nonce, nodes, the hash of the previous block.Data ‚Äî The data in the block depends upon the reason for which the blockchain technology is being used. So in case, the blockchain technology is being used to record the history of a land, the data in the block would be the plot number, names of the seller and the buyer and the paid amount. In case it‚Äôs being used for cryptocurrency the block data will include the names of the sender and the receiver and the amount.Hash Function ‚ÄîThe hash function acts like the fingerprint of the block. Every block is represented by a unique Hash Function. The size of hash function for every block remains the same. It will take any length data and create a fixed length cryptic output. Hashing works only in one direction so it helps increase the security of the block. If you try to change the content of the block the Hash Function which represents this particular block will change accordingly.Hash of the previous block ‚Äî As mentioned, a blockchain consists of a sequential connection of blocks. Let‚Äôs consider the previous example -In the above example, every block contains two hash functions. One represents that very block and the other represents the previous block. The first block is called as Genesis Block and is represented as ‚Äò0‚Äô hash value. In this manner, every block is linked to the previous block. This keeps the record of the transactions in series as they have originally occurred.The purpose of having the hash of the previous block is to ensure security against hacking. When someone hacks into any of the blocks to modify its content, the hash of the block subsequently changes. This causes the mismatch of the hash function with the next block and it breaks the link.In the example, if someone modifies the second block, Hash 2 will change to the new hash 4. Once this change is made, the following block which contains the previous hash value as 2 will be disconnected and the chain is broken.Nonce ‚Äî It is a number added to each of hash function which can only be used once. This is used in an authentication protocol to ensure the old data is not reused and reworked upon.Proof of Work ‚Äî In order to avoid the application of any wrongful changes in a block and the consequent blocks, blockchain technology implements a mechanism called as proof of work. This states that for any changes that are applied it takes a specific amount of time to create the new block. For example ‚Äî Bitcoin takes 10 minutes to update or add new block to the chain. So if one block is tampered with, the following block will have to be updated as well which would take a long time.Distributed Network ‚Äî To secure the data in a blockchain, it uses a P2P network instead of a centralized controlled network. Everyone is allowed to participate. The members of this P2P network is known as Nodes. Every node of the network has a full copy of the blockchain data. The verification of this data is done by every node in the network. At least 50% of the nodes of the P2P network should positively verify the data to add the block to the chain or for the changes to be successfully implemented on any specific block. This is called Mining.Nodes ‚Äî It has minimum data required for any transaction to be processed. It sends queries to the full node in case it needs more information to move forward. Need low storage memory.Full Nodes ‚Äî Entire copy of the copy of the blockchain. Requires high storage capacity.Miners ‚Äî They are full nodes which listen to transactions and add transactions into blocks after carrying out the proof of work. They are rewarded whenever a block is added to the chain.We started with Cryptocurrency but now Blockchains are being used widely across many sectors.Such As‚Ä¶.Effective as it may be, we cannot overlook the limitations of using Blockchain Technology.They are‚Ä¶.With all these limitations, blockchain cannot be implemented without costing a good amount of money and resource for standardization, security and better performance.Thank you for reading.

How to Deploy TensorFlow to Android (feat. TensorFlow Lite),DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-to-deploy-tensorflow-to-android-feat-tensorflow-lite-957a903be4d,Tyler Walker,170,3,425,"In this article, I will assume you have a model of the form I discussed in my previous article, titled How to convert a TensorFlow Estimator to TensorFlow Lite. This time, we‚Äôre going to look into the details of how to nestle that TensorFlow Lite model into an Android project.The first thing you need is the TensorFlow Lite dependency. I am using 1.12, as that is the same version which I used to convert the model. I know things are upgrading rapidly, but that version is stable and quite functional:The key problem you will face is how to format inputs and outputs to the TensorFlow Lite interpreter, such that everything gets passed through the placeholder op and works fine.www.datadriveninvestor.comThe first thing you need to do is drag your .tflite model into Android assets. Having done that, TensorFlow code examples give us this handy function for reading in a file in a format the Interpreter likes.Then you can initialize a TensorFlow Lite interpreter:Now, all you need are appropriate data structures to hold input and output to the interpreter. Likely you will have some sort of 2D array representing an input image. In my case, the pre-formatted data is a FloatArray. This needs to be allocated to a byte buffer. I use these utility methods to do this simply:With input data structure in place, we just need a place to hold the output. If you followed my suggestion from the last tutorial, your model will be outputting only the SoftMax tensor, and the following output data structure will be sufficient:Notice it‚Äôs an array wrapped around an array of the size corresponding to the number of labels in your model. Now we are ready to run the model and get our predictions out:Call this function on the output array like:So that‚Äôs it for now. I skipped everything involving how to get the Float data in the first place. In another article, I‚Äôll go into how to set up a camera and convert it‚Äôs output to pixelated data in the form of a FloatArray.Hopefully, this was helpful. The last thing I want to mention is that for those of you out there who are interested in Machine Learning or Japanese (I know, unusual combo), I just released an app to the Play store called Kanji Reader. It uses TensorFlow to decode images of Kanji, providing their readings and translations.Here‚Äôs a link to the Play store entry:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tylerwalker.io.kanjireaderEventually, I will go into how I accomplished this step by step, so keep following me for more machine learning explanations and examples.

"Part 7: Review of Gradients, Hessians, and Newton‚Äôs Method with Examples Implemented in Tensorflow",DataDrivenInvestor,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/part-7-review-of-gradients-hessians-and-newtons-method-with-examples-implemented-in-tensorflow-9a1798a4c33b,Free of Confines,187,7,1032,"In Part 5, we had reviewed functions, derivatives, and optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent and Newton‚Äôs method. We considered functions with one variable, i.e., single-dimensional input variable, and looked into the ideas of first derivative, second derivative, and Taylor series expansion. These concepts can be extended to functions with more than one input variable, i.e., multi-dimensional input variable.In this section, we will review these extensions with concrete examples in three-dimensional spaces. Examples are coded in Tensorflow and plotted to help visualize the concepts of gradients and Hessians. In addition, we will work through function minimization exercises using Gradient Descent and Newton‚Äôs method. These concepts are fundamental to many of the learning algorithms used as part of training in Machine Learning.www.datadriveninvestor.comThe best way to read the article is to follow along with the Google Colaboratory Notebook which has all the code and explanatory notes. To do this, click on the link below; remember you don‚Äôt need to install any software and the codes in the Notebook can be run on your phone or desktop (you may need a gmail account). Explanatory notes in the Notebook will contain more detail than you will find in this article.colab.research.google.comIf you are pressed for time, then you can read through this article which should give you good overview of the concepts with plots to illustrate them.Let us first pick a f(x) to work with through this treatment: For sake of simplicity, we will assume f(x) that evaluates to a number at any x but x is not a number but a 2 x 1 vector, i.e., two-dimensional. Note concepts that we will discuss is not limited to two dimensions but extend naturally to multiple dimensions.Gradient of f() is a 2 x 1 vector of partial derivatives with respect to x_1 and x_2 is defined asHessian matrix is an extension of the second derivative in two dimensions and is defined as follows:Let us compute gradient and Hessian of a function f(x) defined as shown below:where A is a 2 x 2 matrix, b is a 2 x 1 vector, and c is a number. Note f(x) will compute to a number. A, b, and c are parameters of the equation, i.e., user-defined or defined by the given problem. The vector x has two entries or two dimensions <x_1, x_2>. Note T is the transform operator. So, why did we pick this equation? The equation is quadratic, i.e., elements of x get raised to power of 2 but no more, and such equation show up as cost function in many optimization problems.The gradient of the function, following the above definition, can be computed and it is (thanks rafa nowak for spotting the error ‚Äî fixed now)Hessian of the function, again following above definitions, can be computed and it isIn this section, we will compute gradients of three choice functions and analyze their profiles. In the code below, we evaluate gradient and Hessian using in-built functions in Tensorflow.Let us examine the surfaces of each example function f(x); the code below will let you plot surfaces in 3 dimensions.Surface of the function in this example is bowl-like (i.e., convex) and has a unique minimum, i.e., bottom of the cup. At the minimum, gradient of the function will vanish, i.e., evaluates to zero, and eigen values of Hessian will be all negative (more information in the Google Colaborator Notebook).Surface of the function in this example is like an inverted bowl(i.e., concave) and has a unique maximum. At the maximum, gradient of the function vanishes, i..e, evaluates to zero, and eigen values of Hessian will be all positive (more information in the Google Collaborator Notebook).Surface of the function in this example is particularly interesting: the function has no unique minimum or maximum. Note that minima of the function occurs on either side of one of the axes while maxima of the function occurs on either side of the other axes. The function should remind you of a saddle and point in the middle (illustrated with a poorly drawn arrow in the figure) where the gradient vanishes but eigen values of Hessian are positive and negative. You can examine these eigen values by running the code in the Google Collaborator Notebook.In summary, simply looking for vanishing gradient isn‚Äôt sufficient and we need to examine second derivative (or Hessian) to confirm if a point maximizes or minimizes the function or is it simply a saddle point.In general, optimization problems involve determining parameter set that minimizes or maximizes a cost function. Cost function, like f(x), is designed specific to the problem that you are trying to solve. We will describe two fundamental methods to search and arrive at minima or maxima of a given cost function.In a previous article, we have described the gradient descent algorithm in detail. Gradient of a function points in the direction where the function is maximized and therefore, the algorithm chooses to move in a direction opposite to the gradient. Gradient descent algorithm in multi-dimensional space is similar to that in one-dimensional space and the update equation is as follows:In a previous article, we have described the Newton‚Äôs method in detail. As in the one-dimensional case, function f(x) can be approximated with first three terms of the Taylor‚Äôs series:Solving for gamma by setting the above approximation to zero which in turn leads to the following update equation:For more information, read notes in my Google Collaboratory Notebook. Below is an implementation of the Newton‚Äôs method:Ideas discussed in this article get used in elementary to advanced optimization problems and show up in many of the popular machine learning algorithms. Understanding error surfaces and how we navigate them using Gradient Descent and Newton‚Äôs method is fundamental to learning more advanced algorithms. Cost functions may vary, their complexity may vary in the problems you tackle but these optimization methods or variations of these methods will get used repeatedly.You may be interested in other articles in this series:Part 6: K-Nearest Neighbor Classification with NumPy / Tensorflow on Fashion MNIST DatasetPart 5: Introduction to Gradient-Descent and Newton‚Äôs Algorithms with TensorflowPart 4: Review of Building a Neural NetworkPart 3: Understanding Results from the Neural NetworkPart 2: Build a Neural Network with TensorflowPart 1: Install Python 3.6 and Tensorflow",17/03/2019,2,0,0,6,,,19,1,0,18,34
